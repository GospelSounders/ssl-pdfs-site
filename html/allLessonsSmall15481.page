See Gen. </div><div class="t m3f3 xb9 h35 y8e0 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">1:26, 27; 5:1, 2; 9:6; Eph. 4:24; Col. 3:10; James 3:9. In this term lies the whole </div><div class="t m9b xb9 h35 yd5 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">essence of man—his origin, his nature, and his destiny. But what does the term </div><div class="t m2d8 xb9 h35 y2d9 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">actually mean? Many books have been written in an attempt to give a right in-</div><div class="t m3ee xb9 h35 yab4 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">terpretation of the term &quot;the image of God.&quot; And there is yet no end to the </div><div class="t mad9 x3 h35 y243 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">debate. What is the difficulty? For one thing, the reality of it is foreign to us. </div><div class="t m717 xb9 h35 y6ea ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">We cannot point to any ordinary human being who in his life and person fully </div><div class="t md6 x3 h35 y1d0 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">reflects the image of God. Furthermore, the Bible itself nowhere gives us a full </div><div class="t m342 x3 h35 y125 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and clear definition. To the contrary, from the many texts that speak of the </div><div class="t m9be x3 h35 y2b7 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">image of God a rather large variety of meanings emerges. Adam and Eve were </div><div class="t m1f3 x3 h35 y153 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the only persons who, at least for some time, really lived up to their calling as </div><div class="t m348 x3 h35 y17b ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the image of God; but the descriptions of them in the Bible are very limited. </div><div class="t m2df x17 h35 y1229 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Would Bible writers have used the term so often if it is impossible for man </div><div class="t mf7 x3 h35 y103 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to understand its true meaning? Would they have urged us to be renewed after </div><div class="t mb10 x3 h35 y9ab ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the image of our Creator if they had not spelled out its meaning? Would Ellen </div><div class="t m22e x3 h35 ya ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">White so consistently have written about the restoration of the image of God </div><div class="t m168 x3 h35 y5f ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in man as Jesus&apos; work of redemption if the meaning were unknowable? The </div><div class="t m211 xbd h35 y605 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">descriptions of Adam, the first man created in the image of God, may be vague. </div><div class="t m195 x3 h35 y10 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">But the first Adam has been followed by the second Adam. In Jesus Christ, </div><div class="t m77 x3 h35 y26b ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">whom the Scriptures call the very image of God, we find the perfect model of </div><div class="t madf x3 h35 y21a ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">a true man. See 2 Cor. 4:4; Col. 1:15. And the apostle Paul says that the be-</div><div class="t me40 xbd h35 y657 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">liever has to &quot;put on the new nature, which is being constantly renewed in the </div><div class="t mb8c x3 h35 y369 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">image of its Creator,&quot; &quot;which shows itself in the just and devout life.&quot; Col. 3:10; </div><div class="t m382 x3 h35 y84b ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Eph. 4:24, NEB.
