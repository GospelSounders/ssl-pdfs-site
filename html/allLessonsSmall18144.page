Yet the church remains a </div><div class="t m27c xda h35 y2320 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;mystery&quot; in the biblical sense, defying simple explanations. Since it partakes of the </div><div class="t m583 xda h35 y2189 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">nature of both the human and the divine, it is difficult to dissect it fully and lay bare all </div><div class="t m9d7 xda h35 y15f5 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">its properties. </div><div class="t m32b xbd h35 yd36 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The lessons this quarter look at the church, including your church and mine, from </div><div class="t m560 xda h35 yb74 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the viewpoint of the biblical revelation concerning it. We believe without shadow of </div><div class="t md30 xda h35 y1068 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">doubt that the Bible is the Word of God and that in it we find a true representation of </div><div class="t ma98 xda h35 yd90 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">God&apos;s character and purpose and of His dealings with His people through the </div><div class="t mbc xda h35 y2d5 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">centuries. </div><div class="t m2f9 x4 h35 yacc ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The view of the writer of these lessons is that the church can best be understood </div><div class="t m464 xda h35 ya0e ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and appreciated in the light of God&apos;s intelligence and love. God wanted a universe </div><div class="t m5eb xda h35 y149e ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that worshiped Him freely and with understanding. In order to have this He had to </div><div class="t m46a xda h35 y97b ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">allow even for freedom to choose the wrong. This involved a tremendous risk, which </div><div class="t m55a xda h35 y7ce ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was taken. Sin, in terms of misunderstanding God and misusing His entrusted </div><div class="t m38c xda h35 y1039 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">properties, did indeed arise. The church is a key part of God&apos;s great plan to vindicate </div><div class="t m101 xda h35 y11c2 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">His character and to take away sin without detracting from the freedom which God&apos;s </div><div class="t m220 xda h35 y20c9 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">love requires in the universe. </div><div class="t m37e x4 h35 y1573 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The church exists wherever we find God&apos;s people, from the beginning of time to the </div><div class="t m2f1 xda h35 yb78 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">present and on into eternity. But in these lessons we are thinking of the church </div><div class="t m709 xda h35 ya2d ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">primarily in terms of God&apos;s activity after the birth of Jesus. </div><div class="t m4f x4 h35 yd06 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The first lesson emphasizes that God is in control in every situation. Sin, whether in </div><div class="t m4ca xda h35 y7f6 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">heaven or on earth, did not take, Him by surprise. He had a plan to meet it, one </div><div class="t m380 xda h35 ya91 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">consistent with His justice and replete with His mercy. The church is part of that plin, </div><div class="t mbb7 xda h35 y9b6 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">being the arena and means of His activity. </div><div class="t m56a x4 h35 ya15 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">We see that the church is based on a firm foundationâ€”Jesus Christ, the Son of the </div><div class="t m624 xda h35 y984 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Living God, recognized and made known by divine revelation. Jesus Christ has built </div><div class="t me71 xda h35 y1009 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the church, and the gates of hell will not prevail against it. The agency for bringing the </div><div class="t m53c xda h35 y103b ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">benefits of the Father and the Son to the New Testament church is the Holy Spirit, as </div><div class="t m87a xc4 h35 y56f ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">promised by Jesus to His disciples. (See John 14 through 17.) </div><div class="t mff x4 h35 y14e4 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">How can we recognize the church? What are its characteristics? We will seek </div><div class="t mc8 xda h35 y770 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">answers to these questions in Scripture. We will notice that the church is best </div><div class="t m115f xda h35 y13e4 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">understood in terms of relationships. Yet no purely human relationship can encom-</div><div class="t m771 xc4 h35 y964 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">pass all that is involved. </div><div class="t m1a9 x4 h35 y11d4 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">One aspect of the church is the tension between its call to holiness and its </div><div class="t m778 xda h35 y1267 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">involvement in sin. To emphasize the one without denying the other is important. Can </div><div class="t m24f xc4 h35 yde4 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">we do that? How can a ChriStian be a saint and a sinner at the same time? Do we need </div><div class="t m5eb xc4 h35 ye00 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to redefine our terms? </div><div class="t m5f9 x4 h35 y1238 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">No area of church life is more debated than that of its structure. Structure and </div><div class="t mb18 xc4 h35 ya1a ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">organization it must have. But what should be its lines of authority? Unfortunately, </div><div class="t me81 xc4 h35 ycb4 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">history has not shown the church at its best, because emphasis on hierarchy has </div><div class="t m6e xc4 h35 ybdf ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sometimes taken the place of service. Is there a way that we can have order and yet </div><div class="t mde xc4 h35 y731 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">not reduce the spirit? Can we involve all members of the church, and not merely the </div><div class="t md04 xc4 h35 y990 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">clergy, in organization? These and other questions reveal the importance of our </div><div class="t mb31 xc4 h35 y4f4 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">subject. </div><div class="t mca x4 h35 yb8d ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">May God grant that in the study of these lessons we will discover our role in the </div><div class="t m1bf xc4 h35 y1ff0 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">church and by our faithfulness cooperate more fully with God&apos;s plans. </div></div><div class="pi" data-data='{"ctm":[1.000000,0.000000,0.000000,1.000000,0.000000,0.000000]}'></div></div>
