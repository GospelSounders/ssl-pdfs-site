The Dream Revealed (Dan. 2:24-45). </div><div class="t m273 xc5 he y3046 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">We can pray, but we cannot decide for God when and how our prayers should </div><div class="t mf36 x29 he y2f14 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">be answered. True prayer is not trying to force our will on God. It is letting Him </div><div class="t m1645 x29 he y2c8c ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">know what we perceive as our needs. As children ask their parents for things that </div><div class="t m98c x29 he y2b14 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">they think they need, so we as Christians can approach the throne of grace and </div><div class="t m442 x29 he y2bd6 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">present our requests. But we must leave it to God to decide when and what to </div><div class="t m915 x29 he y2bd2 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">give. In the case of Daniel and his companions the answer came immediately. In </div><div class="t m9c6 x29 he y2cc1 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">some cases answers come before we ask. (See Isa. 65:24.) In all cases, they </div><div class="t m467 x29 he y2881 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">come according to God&apos;s will and what He knows is best for us. </div><div class="t m2ca xc h1 y22b6 ff1 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">How is human nature demonstrated in Arioch&apos;s claim to have &quot;found&quot; </div><div class="t m64d x64 h1 y206c ff1 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Daniel? Dan. 2:25. </div><div class="t md5 xc he y1efb ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Arioch showed a very human trait, that of claiming all the credit possible to </div><div class="t m1e7 x64 he yc15 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">oneself. The fact is that Arioch had not &quot;found&quot; Daniel; Daniel had come to him </div><div class="t mae7 x64 he y1a0f ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">first. </div><div class="t md28 xc h1 y1aa2 ff1 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">How did Daniel respond to the king&apos;s inquiry as to whether he knew the </div><div class="t m2f9 x64 h1 y400 ff1 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">dream and its interpretation? Dan. 2:26, 27. </div><div class="t mb4b xc he y199c ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">In contrast to Arioch&apos;s self-serving claim, Daniel made it clear that he could </div><div class="t m874 x64 he y1d8e ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">not give the answer on the basis of his own knowledge. In fact, no human being </div><div class="t m6b x64 he y197e ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">could in his or her own power answer the king&apos;s request. </div><div class="t m415 xc h21 yb32 ff6 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;But there is a God in heaven&quot; </div><div class="t me5c xaf he yb9a ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">(verse 28). Here is the clue; God is the true </div><div class="t m713 x64 he y6a2 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">source of knowledge. He is different from the gods whom the Babylonians wor-</div><div class="t m1182 x64 he y1ed6 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">shiped. He is not the God of the Jews only. He is the God of the universe, the </div><div class="t m367 x64 he y19f4 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">only One and true God. </div><div class="t m7d7 x5f h21 y38b ff6 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;That revealeth secrets, and maketh known to the king . . . what shall be in </div><div class="t mc6b x64 h21 yf5d ff6 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the latter days&quot; </div><div class="t m4c4 x7c he yf5d ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">(verse 28). Although God in heaven alone knows everything, </div><div class="t m75b x64 he y1da0 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">He communicates with people on earth. He opens up the future so that we may </div><div class="t m313 x64 he y131 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">know how things will end. There is a goal toward which things move under His </div><div class="t mb36 x64 he y6aa ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">direction. </div><div class="t mb06 x5f he y1932 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">King Nebuchadnezzar hardly could miss the lesson. The Babylonians wor-</div><div class="t m105 x64 he y1960 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">shiped false gods. The priests who claimed to get answers from their gods were </div><div class="t m93 x64 he y422 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">not in touch with reality. Nebuchadnezzar had a perfect right to doubt the entire </div><div class="t m5a0 x64 he yc2c ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">system.
