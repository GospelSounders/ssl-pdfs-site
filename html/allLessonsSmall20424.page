(See Luke 24:25-27.) In fact, the main message of the </div><div class="t m1226 x14 he y2ee0 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Old Testament is that God will send a Deliverer who will save His people from </div><div class="t m356 x14 he y2cfe ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">their sins. (See 1 Pet. 1:10-12.) In our study of the Book of Daniel we shall see </div><div class="t m808 x14 he y2aa8 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that prophecy clearly predicts the time of the coming of the Messiah and His </div><div class="t med9 x14 he y29ed ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">work. Jesus as the Messiah is the center and core of the Old Testament as well as </div><div class="t m77a x14 he y2b3f ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of the New. Our first endeavor when studying Bible prophecy should be to dis-</div><div class="t m467 x14 he y29cc ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">cover how the prophecy centers in Christ. </div><div class="t mae7 x29 h1 y21b9 ff1 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">2. </div><div class="t mf25 x6f h1 y1ad2 ff1 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Must Recognize Signs and Symbols. </div><div class="t mb31 x29 he y2190 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">In dealing with His people God uses signs and symbols to impress important </div><div class="t m164d x14 he y21a4 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">truths upon the people. Thus, after the flood, He made a covenant that He would </div><div class="t m131c x5d he y213e ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">never destroy the world with a flood again. He set a rainbow in the sky as a sign </div><div class="t m1df x14 he y1510 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">or token of His promise (Gen. 9:12, 13). He said that the Sabbath was to be kept </div><div class="t mbb2 x14 he y18b0 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">as a sign of sanctification—the symbol of a close relationship between Himself </div><div class="t m646 x14 he y20dc ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and His people. The entire sacrificial system was full of symbolism to show that </div><div class="t m66f x14 he y1f50 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">without the shedding of blood there could be no remission of sins. (See Heb. </div><div class="t md28 x14 he y1085 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">9:22.) Miracles often were used as signs of God&apos;s power and the authenticity of </div><div class="t m852 x14 he y17ae ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">His word. (See 2 Kings 20:1-11; Isa. 7:11-14.) Furthermore, God communi-</div><div class="t m582 x14 he y17af ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">cated with people through dreams in which symbols were used. (See Gen. 37:5-</div><div class="t ma71 x5d he y1d8d ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">10.) </div><div class="t mdc8 x29 he y1672 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Thus we are not surprised to find dreams and miracles in Daniel. In fact, the </div><div class="t m15b x5d he y1f24 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">miracles seemingly are as unforgettable to us as they must have been to those </div><div class="t m758 x14 he y1c5a ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">who observed them in actuality. </div><div class="t m671 x29 he y104d ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Symbols are remembered easily and serve as pictures that we can store in the </div><div class="t m90 x5d he y1c7a ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">mind and thus recall the lessons they teach. Remember how effective Jesus was </div><div class="t m263 x14 he y195b ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">as a teacher because He taught in parables. Prophetic symbols can be misapplied </div><div class="t m394 x14 he y1a25 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">easily. One of the best ways to keep from doing so is to study carefully how the </div><div class="t m1df x14 he y13fa ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Bible writers and those who interpreted them in Bible days used and understood </div><div class="t m774 x5d he y1d19 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the symbols involved. </div><div class="t m308 x29 h1 y20c7 ff1 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">3. </div><div class="t mafa x66 h1 y1d51 ff1 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Must Recognize That Some Prophecies Are Conditional. </div><div class="t m235 x64 he y1e88 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">God promised Israel that the chosen nation would become the center of a </div><div class="t m709 x14 he y138c ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">worldwide reformation, would be delivered from all enemies, and would be-</div><div class="t m12d6 x14 he y1872 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">come the center of the Messiah&apos;s kingdom. (See Isa. 2:10-21 and 4:2-6 for ex-</div><div class="t ma63 x14 he y1f27 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">amples.) But because of Israel&apos;s failure to meet the conditions (see Deut. 28:15-</div><div class="t maac x14 he y1d1e ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">68), God could not (and now never will be able to) fulfill the promises to them as </div><div class="t m422 x14 he y1c89 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">a nation.
