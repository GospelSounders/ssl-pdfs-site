He was the only one </div><div class="t m5e0 xd4 h35 y20aa ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">left of the twelve men chosen by Jesus to be His disciples. The last apostle had </div><div class="t m111e xd4 h35 y2228 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">fallen on hard times. He had been arrested, boiled in oil and miraculously delivered, </div><div class="t mf7 xd3 h35 y204e ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and eventually banished to the penal colony on Patmos. There, on a Sabbath day, </div><div class="t m78b xd4 h35 y761 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">he saw Jesus, and Jesus spoke to him. What He told John, and also revealed by </div><div class="t m771 xd3 h35 y8cf ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">an angel, was not merely a message to the beloved disciple, but news from the risen </div><div class="t m604 xd3 h35 y2049 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Lord for the churches in the vicinity of John&apos;s home. It was the last time that word </div><div class="t md3 xd3 h35 y373 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">could come from Jesus through one who had personally walked and talked with </div><div class="t m56 xd3 h35 yef2 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Him. John in turn wrote the news to those who knew him. Today we read that news </div><div class="t m146f xd4 h35 ycc0 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in the book of Revelation. </div><div class="t m22e xbd h35 y1279 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The news was that Jesus would assuredly conquer the powers of evil, which </div><div class="t m2d4 xd3 h35 y1228 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">had not seemed to diminish during John&apos;s long life. He unveiled the strategy of </div><div class="t ma74 xd3 h35 y2d9 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the evil power and revealed the way in which victory would come. That news is </div><div class="t m27b xd3 h35 y9d6 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">still news today. Evil still appears entrenched. But the passing of centuries has </div><div class="t m39d xd3 h35 y7cf ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">brought the collapse of evil power structures in the way that Jesus told John they </div><div class="t ma66 xd3 h35 yc6c ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">would fall. This encourages us that the present and future entrenchments of evil </div><div class="t maf2 xd3 h35 ya5b ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">will also fall and Jesus will be unconditionally victorious as He told John on Patmos. </div><div class="t mb3 x4 h35 y9a1 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">This news is not limited to the scene of international politics. The news is also </div><div class="t m2fe xd3 h35 y1938 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">for the individual. He can personally conquer evil and join in Christ&apos;s victory. &quot;When </div><div class="t mb15 xd3 h35 y8b6 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">we as a people understand what this book [of Revelation] means to us, there will </div><div class="t m476 xc3 h35 yb10 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">be seen among us a great </div><div class="t m759 xa4 h35 yb10 ff5 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">revival.&quot;—Testimonies to Ministers, </div><div class="t m1322 x75 h35 yb11 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">page 113. </div><div class="t mc4 x4 h35 y9f4 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Ellen G.
