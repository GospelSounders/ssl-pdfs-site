Long-suffering is another name for </div><div class="t m45f x92 he y17ac ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">patience.

Faith means veracity, so that a man&apos;s word is as </div><div class="t m2eb x92 he y21f0 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">good as an oath. And then, lastly, there are certain fruits which have rela-</div><div class="t m2c6 x92 he y1cb5 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tion to ourselves.
