He makes no men-</div><div class="t m3c9 x4a h2d y2b8e ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tion of &quot;false prophets&quot; or &quot;false teachers&quot; (2 Peter 2:1). Instead, he </div><div class="t m296 x4a h2d y2b0d ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">speaks of &quot;certain men&quot; who are &quot;ungodly&quot; or &quot;impious,&quot; &quot;lascivious&quot; </div><div class="t m735 x4a h2d y2a97 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">or &quot;immoral,&quot; and who deny the lordship or divinity of Christ. He then </div><div class="t m220 x4a h2d y295d ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">markedly departs from Peter&apos;s outline, making no reference to Noah or to </div><div class="t m434 x4a h2d y291a ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Lot, but writing of Israel&apos;s escape from Egypt and the death of the un-</div><div class="t m203 x4a h2d yc43 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">grateful, unbelieving multitude (verse 5). (Compare Num. 14:26-33.) </div><div class="t m365 x4a h2d y3 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Jude&apos;s comment on the rebellious angels is close to Peter&apos;s but stresses </div><div class="t m9f1 x4a h2d y226 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the finality of their punishment, for they were to be shackled &quot;in everlast-</div><div class="t mcdb x4a h2d y1c5 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ing chains&quot; from which there would be no escape until judgment day. In a </div><div class="t m3e0 x4a h2d y484 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">manner somewhat similar to Peter&apos;s he comments on the fate of the twin </div><div class="t mae8 x4a h2d y3fb ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">cities of the plain. But he adds &quot;the cities about them,&quot; which confirms </div><div class="t m25d x4a h2d yda4 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">their gross immorality and the irreversible nature of their end—they suf-</div><div class="t m34a x4a h2d y11d ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">fered &quot;the vengeance of eternal fire,&quot; that is, unquenchable fire (verse 7). </div><div class="t me1a x61 h2d y778 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">But these are differences in approach only. There is no conflict between </div><div class="t m9f7 x4a h2d y8e1 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Peter and Jude in their assessment of the dangers confronting their </div><div class="t m143 x4a h2d y1217 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">churches. It is inevitable that there should be differences between Peter </div><div class="t m5d8 x18 h2d yaf ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and Jude, for the apostle devotes 22 verses (2:1-22) or a whole chapter to </div><div class="t m14b x4a h2d y333 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the destructive work of the errant teachers, while Jude uses only 12 </div><div class="t m196 x4a h2d y319 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">verses (5-16) for the same purpose. Furthermore, Jude spends more </div><div class="t mb98 x4a h2d y15fe ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">space on certain topics than does Peter, so the difference between the two </div><div class="t m3e7 x4a h2d ya5e ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">epistles grows even greater. This is emphasized when we note that Peter </div><div class="t m306 x4a h2d y248 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">deals with &quot;the angels that sinned&quot; in verse 4 and does not refer to &quot;an-</div><div class="t m437 x4a h2d y587 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">gels which are greater in power and might&quot; until verse 11, six intervening </div><div class="t m3bd x4a h2d y34c ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">verses later. Jude, by contrast, makes his corresponding references in </div><div class="t m42d x4a h2d yde ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">verses 6 and 9, with only two intervening verses. It will also be noted that </div><div class="t m1b4 x4a h2d y37a ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Peter&apos;s reference to great and powerful angels in verse 11 does not men-</div><div class="t mae8 x18 h2d yed6 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tion &quot;Michael the archangel,&quot; whereas Jude is specific, introducing the </div><div class="t m10f x18 h2d y93 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">angelic leader by name and identifying the topic of dispute, &quot;the body of </div><div class="t m7d8 x18 h2d y826 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Moses&quot; (verse 9). </div><div class="t mcf6 x74 h2d y55e ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Closer examination of Jude&apos;s message reveals that while he gives more </div><div class="t m223 x18 h2d y31e ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">attention to the dispute over Moses, he deals only briefly with Balaam, </div><div class="t m162 x18 h2d y40a ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and then refers to others whom Peter does not even mention, namely, </div><div class="t m5a0 x18 h2d ya59 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Core or Korah (Jude 11; see also Numbers 16) and Cain. This may suggest </div><div class="t m7a8 x18 h2d y6e5 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that the two authors were writing for different groups of readers—Jude </div><div class="t m359 x18 h2d y98 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">for Jewish Christians, Peter for Gentiles.
