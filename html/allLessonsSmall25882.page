They had terrorized the region so </div><div class="t m1ba0 x71 h27 y2945 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">much that the community nearly became a ghost town. </div><div class="t m1160 x74 h27 y228f ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Finally the police caught Abel and sent him to prison. He was </div><div class="t m2f5 x71 h27 y230a ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">assigned to work six days a week with Sundays off. But Abel noticed </div><div class="t mb18 x71 h27 ya83 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that some prisoners did not work on Saturdays or Sundays. He </div><div class="t mae4 x71 h27 y1c10 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">learned that they were Sabbath keepers. Abel was jealous and </div><div class="t m14ab x71 h27 yda9 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">decided to claim to be a Sabbath keeper so that he too could get </div><div class="t m64f x71 h27 y65c ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Saturdays off. It worked, and he wanted to use his free day to sleep, </div><div class="t m1d07 x71 h27 y1731 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">but he feared that the guards might notice and send him back to work. </div><div class="t m1bd2 x71 h27 y14d4 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">So he decided to attend the Sabbath worship services instead. </div><div class="t mda9 x74 h27 y149e ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Then Abel escaped from prison. With two of his former gang </div><div class="t m8b2 x71 h27 yacf ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">members, he fled into the jungle. The trio built a bush house for </div><div class="t mea8 x71 h27 y1026 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">themselves and dug a tunnel under their home as an escape route </div><div class="t m5d5 x71 h27 y12b0 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">should police find them. </div><div class="t m114c x74 h27 y901 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">While they worked, Abel did some serious thinking. One day he </div><div class="t m409 x71 h27 yb0e ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">told his friends, &quot;We are not living right. We have hurt people; we </div><div class="t m800 x71 h27 y109b ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">are always running from the law. We need to change our ways.&quot; </div><div class="t m49b x74 h27 y139e ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;What do you have in mind?&quot; one of his friends asked. </div><div class="t m315 x74 h27 yfd2 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;We should attend church.
