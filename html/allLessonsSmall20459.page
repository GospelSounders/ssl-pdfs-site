It was that he had not learned the </div><div class="t m135e x36 he y2f9b ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">lessons God had taught his grandfather, Nebuchadnezzar. God had humbled the </div><div class="t mbb2 x36 he y2d10 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">grandfather and taken the dominion away from him until he had acknowledged </div><div class="t m7e9 x36 he y29e6 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the true God and made a proclamation to this effect. But Belshazzar had know-</div><div class="t m689 x36 he y2a70 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ingly and willfully despised the God of the Jewish captives by dishonoring the </div><div class="t mafa x36 he y2a0c ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">vessels that had been dedicated to sacred service in the temple at Jerusalem.
