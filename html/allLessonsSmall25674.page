All week Lidia prayed that God would intervene </div><div class="t me5c x16 h28 y22a9 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">so she would not have to work on Sabbath.

There he saw </div><div class="t mbb2 x71 h28 ya84 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">his donkey lying in the middle of the road. Several neighbors stood </div><div class="t m10b x71 h28 y1cd0 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">looking at the animal. &quot;Something happened to your donkey,&quot; one </div><div class="t mef x71 h28 y62e ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">man told Ivan. &quot;He just fell to the ground.&quot; </div><div class="t m213 x74 h28 y1169 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;How can that be?&quot; Ivan said, examining the donkey. &quot;He was </div><div class="t m9b4 x71 h28 y10bd ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">fine a little while ago.&quot; Ivan ordered the animal to stand, but the </div><div class="t m2a6 x71 h28 y1dce ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">donkey did not respond. Ivan jerked on the halter and shouted at </div><div class="t m12a x71 h28 y203b ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the donkey to get up, but the donkey did not move. </div><div class="t m203 x74 h28 y11df ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The neighbors pushed and tugged on the animal while Ivan </div><div class="t m12a x71 h28 yd3a ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">pulled at the harness. But still the donkey did not respond. </div><div class="t m5aa x74 h28 ydcb ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;I can&apos;t imagine what is wrong,&quot; Ivan said, shaking his head. </div><div class="t m7d6 x71 h28 y10da ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;We can&apos;t work in the garden without the donkey.&quot; Angry and </div><div class="t m7e3 x71 h28 y1cfe ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">frustrated, Ivan finally returned to the house to finish his lunch and </div><div class="t m3da x71 h28 y104f ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">mull over the problem. Lidia thanked God for providing a way to </div><div class="t m783 x71 h28 y1cd1 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">keep the Sabbath but prayed for the donkey&apos;s safety as well. </div><div class="t m7a9 x61 h28 yea5 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Several times that afternoon Ivan tried to get the donkey to </div><div class="t mc0 x71 h28 y1d7d ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">stand, but nothing worked. Late in the afternoon Ivan gave up and </div><div class="t m350 x71 h28 y10f3 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">slumped on the front step. It would be dark soon; how would they </div><div class="t m456 x26 h28 y1d3d ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">get back to town without the donkey? </div><div class="t m54e x61 h28 y987 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">At sunset the donkey stirred, then slowly stood to his feet. </div><div class="t m351 x26 h28 y14a1 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Amazed, Ivan ran to see if the donkey was fine. Finding nothing </div><div class="t m771 x26 h28 y1314 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">wrong, he hitched the cart to the donkey and called to Lidia that it </div><div class="t mdd0 x26 h28 y15c2 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was time to go home. </div><div class="t m4d5 x64 h28 y145f ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Ivan had little to say as they rode home that evening.
