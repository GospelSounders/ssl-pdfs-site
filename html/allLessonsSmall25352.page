All these things are </div><div class="t md0e x3e h27 y53a ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">present in his Second Epistle to the Corinthians.

In 1 Corinthians we </div><div class="t mda9 x3e h27 y901 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">learn about conditions in Corinth; in 2 Corinthians we learn about </div><div class="t m64c x3e h27 yb0e ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">conditions in Paul. </div><div class="t m626 x48 h27 y1938 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">While reading this letter, it is tempting to feel disconnected from </div><div class="t m1f8 x3e h27 y3a0 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">it.
