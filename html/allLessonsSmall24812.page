His work was </div><div class="t m1a0 x11 h28 y2a2d ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">well known, and he had a flourishing business in Cotonou, the </div><div class="t mac4 x17 h28 y2a67 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">capital of Benin, a tiny country in West Africa. Then one day his </div><div class="t mf25 x17 h28 y236c ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">right hand was crushed in an accident. His work as a carpenter was </div><div class="t m558 x11 h28 y2433 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">over. Sometimes Victor wondered how God could bring victory </div><div class="t mb06 x17 h28 y229e ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">out of such a loss. </div><div class="t m869 x48 h28 y1c1d ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Victor had to support his family, so he returned to his home </div><div class="t m2a4 x17 h28 y11da ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">village of Lobogo, a farming region 55 miles north of the capital. </div><div class="t m3b0 x17 h28 y1acc ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">His family owned a plot of land there, and he began cultivating it </div><div class="t m6a3 x17 h28 y19a2 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and planted vegetables and nursery stock to sell in the city. </div><div class="t ma00 x48 h28 y1f0f ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">As he traveled back and forth to Lobogo, Victor began to feel a </div><div class="t m7e6 x17 h28 ybec ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">burden for the people there. Many were relatives and old friends. </div><div class="t m7d8 x17 h28 y9ee ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">There was no one else to share the Adventist message with them. </div><div class="t maf2 x17 h28 y199b ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">So Victor began offering his customers Bible studies. In faith, he </div><div class="t mddc x17 h28 y16ab ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">bought a field on which to build a church, and painted a little sign </div><div class="t m5a7 x17 h28 y1b7 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that read &quot;Seventh-day Adventist Church.&quot; He placed it in the </div><div class="t m631 x17 h28 yaa4 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">middle of the empty field. </div><div class="t m415 x48 h28 y1dcf ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">He began spending more and more of his time in Lobogo, and </div><div class="t m306 x17 h28 y1b0f ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">soon he had a group of about 30 people meeting in a temporary </div><div class="t m2a6 x17 h28 y1f59 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">shelter to study the Bible. Three young men were ready for bap-</div><div class="t mb90 x3e h28 y587 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tism, and others soon would be ready. But they had no baptistry. </div><div class="t m992 x48 h28 y15a8 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Victor and the other believers began building a baptismal tank </div><div class="t mce3 x3e h28 yb14 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in the empty field. Bit by bit they bought cement and made blocks. </div><div class="t m9e5 x3e h28 yd0a ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">They sacrificed to put up a temporary shelter around their bap-</div><div class="t m4d2 x3e h28 y1b8c ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tistry. Then they invited a lay evangelist from another area to hold </div><div class="t m2ff x3e h28 y1ca8 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">evangelistic meetings. </div><div class="t m60f x48 h28 y133 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">One day a message came to the mission office. &quot;Pastor, come </div><div class="t m610 x3e h28 y15b3 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">soon. Eleven people want to be baptized.&quot; The minister arrived </div><div class="t m1e4 x3e h28 y4b3 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and interviewed the new believers. Then with great joy he invited </div><div class="t m3bf x3e h28 y102c ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">one after another of the new believers to enter the new baptismal </div><div class="t m1ed x3e h28 yde3 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tank and seal their commitment to a totally different way of life in </div><div class="t m1fe x3e h28 y1360 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Jesus. Faces of new believers shone with joy as they began their </div><div class="t m2b6 x3e h28 ye07 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">new life in Christ, but the most radiant face of all was Victor </div><div class="t m366 x3e h28 y33f ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Kpoto&apos;s. He had watched God bring victory out of apparent loss. </div><div class="t m418 x73 h28 y115a ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Pray for the fewer than 1,000 believers in Benin, and the </div><div class="t m808 x16 h28 y1249 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">handful of faithful workers to minister there. </div><div class="t m191e x73 h22 y19ec ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Inge Gray and her husband have recently transferred from Benin to </div><div class="t mf33 x16 h22 y11f1 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the Africa-Indian Ocean Division in Cote d&apos;Ivoire, West Africa. </div><div class="t m7fc x64 h28 y14ae ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">For Current </div><div class="t m1d7 x5b h28 ybac ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Current Newsbreak.
