The first church to receive a letter probably had copies made </div><div class="t m341 x71 h2d y2e6c ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">for the benefit of other congregations. In that way a greater number of </div><div class="t m111e x71 h2d y298e ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">believers were edified. By his reference to &quot;the other scriptures&quot; (2 Peter </div><div class="t m599 x71 h2d y29b0 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">3:16) Peter indicates that the early church had accepted Paul&apos;s letters as </div><div class="t mf4d x71 h2d y2ac3 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">inspired and had begun to lay the groundwork for the sacred canon of the </div><div class="t m1d4 x71 h2d y293d ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">New Testament. </div><div class="t m5dc x73 h2d y2901 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The above considerations enlarge our view of church life in Asia Minor, </div><div class="t m411 x71 h2d y28d9 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and beyond, during the early decades after Christ&apos;s ascension. Although </div><div class="t m83b x71 h2d y2321 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in most cases the groups of believers were scattered, they communicated </div><div class="t m8b x26 h2d y203d ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">with each other. More interestingly still, it is possible to see Peter and </div><div class="t m3ef x26 h2d y1d48 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Paul both working in that large geographical area with both contributing </div><div class="t mb9a x26 h2d y62b ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to the faith and works of congregations in which each was particularly </div><div class="t m5e9 x71 h2d y1acb ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">interested.

Should the search be widened, it may </div><div class="t m6e4 x26 h2d y1b2c ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">include the whole epistle, but that is scarcely needed, although Paul&apos;s vo-</div><div class="t m3e5 x26 h2d y684 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">luminous letters certainly covered most of the ground traversed by Peter </div><div class="t m9b3 x26 h2d y1b2d ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in this epistle. However, the main thrust of the reference to Paul&apos;s epistles </div><div class="t m7b7 x26 h2d y1b2f ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">concerns &quot;some things hard to be understood&quot; that have been twisted by </div><div class="t m23d x26 h2d y108b ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the &quot;unlearned and unstable&quot; (verse 16). The Greek word for &quot;un-</div><div class="t mb3 x26 h2d y1757 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">learned&quot; is the opposite of the Greek word for learner or disciple. The </div><div class="t m60a x26 h2d y195d ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">word translated &quot;unstable&quot; refers to those who have no support. It is </div><div class="t mab7 x26 h2d y1bf9 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">easy for such people to &quot;wrest&quot; or twist the Scriptures.

But the difficulties in those epistles </div><div class="t m856 x18 h2d y1f6d ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">largely arise from the magnitude of the subjects with which they deal as </div><div class="t m3c1 x18 h2d y19ea ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">well as with Paul&apos;s involved sentence structure. A finite being, although </div><div class="t m9fc x18 h2d y1d23 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">inspired, is struggling to grasp infinity; a human is seeking to explain the </div><div class="t mccf x26 h2d y1cb7 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">divine; a mortal is trying to describe the immortal; a time-bound mind is </div><div class="t m92 x26 h2d y1405 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">grappling with the nature of the eternal.
