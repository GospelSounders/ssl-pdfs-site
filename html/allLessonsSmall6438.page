It probably was </div><div class="t m1115 x17 h2b y1f1c ff4 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">written in Corinth in the spring of A. D. 57 or 58.

Do not hurry. Do not seek to give a whole verse for </div><div class="t ma7d x17 h2b y1dc9 ff4 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">an answer to a question when a word will suffice. Use only that part of </div><div class="t md80 x3e h2b y246 ff4 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the scripture necessary to answer the question.
