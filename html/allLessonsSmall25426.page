But she </div><div class="t m1642 x17 h27 y295c ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">found the teachings shallow. Then Li, a friend of her mother, invited </div><div class="t m193b x17 h27 y23b5 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Chen to a Bible study group in her church. When Chen hesitated, Li </div><div class="t m1ba2 x17 h27 y875 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">challenged her to answer the questions on a Bible lesson.

Because </div><div class="t mae0 x3e h27 y767 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">she was blind, her husband, Hua, took her to the meetings and waited </div><div class="t m7bd x3e h27 y198 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">outside for her.
