Everything </div><div class="t m582 x5d h27 y2b5e ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">looked so worn-out. My thoughts turned toward home. </div><div class="t mf25 x28 h27 y2bb5 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">In my dorm room overlooking the green fields of Newbold </div><div class="t m24d x5d h27 y2288 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">College, my telephone rang. &quot;We need someone to go to </div><div class="t m39d x5d h27 y235f ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Albania to pastor the new members.&quot; The minister&apos;s voice </div><div class="t m407 x5d h27 y2209 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sounded urgent. &quot;Can you go for four months?&quot; </div><div class="t m3d1 x28 h27 yf8e ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">How could I go?
