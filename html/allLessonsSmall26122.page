But the villagers threatened </div><div class="t mb98 x4a h22 y239d ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to kill any Adventist who entered. How could Kumah ask two </div><div class="t m246 x4a h22 y2291 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">pioneers to risk their lives on such a dangerous assignment? Then </div><div class="t m760 x4a h22 y4f8 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">he realized that while the villagers might kill a man, they would </div><div class="t me44 x4a h22 y832 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">not harm a woman! He asked Yinina and Sarah to go. </div><div class="t m1492 x29 h22 y14a9 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Trembling, the women finally agreed to go. They took a bus to the </div><div class="t m1b9f x4a h22 yd90 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">village. But heavy storms made the road impassible, and the women </div><div class="t m24a x4a h22 yd6c ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">had to walk the last few miles, carrying their heavy luggage. </div><div class="t m15b0 x36 h22 yd6d ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">As they approached the village, a crowd gathered. Frangky, the </div><div class="t me02 x14 h22 y1018 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">leader of the village youth, blocked the path and loudly told the </div><div class="t mb55 x14 h22 y15a7 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">women, &quot;If you were men, you would have one minute to leave.&quot; </div><div class="t m15b0 x36 h22 y12ba ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The women bowed their heads and prayed, then started singing </div><div class="t m80a x14 h22 y83a ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">a song of praise to God. The villagers were charmed by the music. </div><div class="t mb94 x14 h22 y957 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Scowls turned to smiles. Even Frangky hummed along. </div><div class="t m1ad4 x36 h22 y146f ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The villagers let the women stay in a large house in the center of </div><div class="t m136c x14 h22 y743 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the village. They offered to teach the villagers to sing their songs. </div><div class="t m172f x14 h22 yd20 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Even Frangky joined the singers. But the daughter of the region&apos;s </div><div class="t m690 x14 h22 y92e ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">king demanded that her father force the women to leave the large </div><div class="t me49 x14 h22 y1157 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">house. The women found themselves living in a tiny crowded hut. </div><div class="t mcbc x36 h22 ya14 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">About a week later this woman&apos;s son died in an accident. She </div><div class="t mfb6 x14 h22 y746 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was crushed and convinced that God was punishing her for driving </div><div class="t m1169 x14 h22 y117c ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the women from the large house. She begged their forgiveness and </div><div class="t m14b6 x14 h22 yf39 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">urged the villagers to listen to them. </div><div class="t m105 x28 h22 yf3c ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Often when the villagers sang, Tarsan, a village dog, howled </div><div class="t mb64 x14 h22 y14e4 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">along. The villagers said that the dog was praising God. </div><div class="t m409 x28 h22 y989 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Frangky joined the women&apos;s Bible study group and eventually </div><div class="t m83e x14 h22 y15fc ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">decided to be baptized.
