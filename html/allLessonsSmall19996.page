That forecast came from &quot;the apostles of </div><div class="t m6f7 x5d h2d y1b09 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">our Lord Jesus Christ,&quot; and dealt with sensual skeptics who would deride </div><div class="t m1b5 x5d h2d y18b0 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the thought of the second coming. The only such specific prophecy re-</div><div class="t m343 x5d h2d y1e5e ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">corded in the Bible is found in 2 Peter 3:3, 4.

If, as seems probable, Jude refers to Peter&apos;s </div><div class="t ma49 x48 h2d y1bac ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">prophecy, Peter&apos;s letter must have been written earlier.
