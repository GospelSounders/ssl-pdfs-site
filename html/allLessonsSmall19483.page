The Bible </div><div class="t m99 x6f h2d y1e52 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">has much to say about our words and their potential for being a blessing </div><div class="t m5e3 x6f h2d y1af6 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">or a curse. There can be no doubt that God intended the ninth command-</div><div class="t m5f9 x66 h2d y10e7 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ment to embrace the entire sphere of our spoken words. In the light that </div><div class="t m47e x66 h2d y1a82 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">shines on God&apos;s law from the gospel, it is clear that God intends the </div><div class="t m86f x66 h2d y1c0c ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">speech of His people to be not only strictly truthful but also kind, helpful, </div><div class="t mb49 x6f h2d y1a4b ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and edifying. Here the thoughts and motives play key roles. Of Jesus, the </div><div class="t m2e2 x66 h2d y1744 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">prophet says, &quot;He will magnify the law, and make it honourable&quot; (Isa. </div><div class="t m8b0 x66 h2d y1f20 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">42:21). This applies to those aspects of God&apos;s law of love that govern our </div><div class="t m167 x66 h2d y1a29 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">conversation in all spheres of our daily lives. </div><div class="t m1e3 x49 h2d y136f ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">If, as we believe, it is out of the heart that the mouth speaketh (see </div><div class="t m34a x66 h2d y1634 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Luke 6:45), then it is the thought that is father to the word. The motive—</div><div class="t m2db x66 h2d y1fe8 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the underlying reason for what we do—likewise influences both the </div><div class="t m73f x66 h2d y1a4f ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">thought and the word.
