Koester </div><div class="t m111e x14 h27 y2c42 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Peter thought Christians should not believe in magic. But </div><div class="t m1476 x27 h27 y2b2e ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">recent events had made him wonder. The pastor where he can-</div><div class="t m10fe x27 h27 y28fc ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">vassed invited him to offer prayer for the church service. Peter </div><div class="t mbb2 x27 h27 y28ce ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">agreed. But people began to tell him, &quot;You are just a boy; you </div><div class="t m450 x27 h27 y22f9 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">should not pray in the divine service. Go and sit where you </div><div class="t mbb x27 h27 y2053 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">belong.&quot; Others called his willingness to pray in public a sign of </div><div class="t m3c0 x27 h27 y3c6 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">pride and disrespect to his elders. Peter worried about these </div><div class="t m1355 x27 h27 y149c ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">charges, but he offered the prayer, as the pastor had requested. </div><div class="t m6eb x14 h27 y976 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The following day Peter rode a bicycle four miles to the </div><div class="t mb5 x11 h27 y1847 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">pastor&apos;s home to pick up some materials. To reach the pastor&apos;s </div><div class="t m1181 x11 h27 y17ee ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">house he had to pass through a village notorious for its powerful </div><div class="t m192a x11 h27 y73c ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">magic. As he rode down a hillside past a certain spot on the road, </div><div class="t m6da x11 h27 ye09 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">suddenly his eyes became so blurred that he could not see. </div><div class="t m6bf x11 h27 y1c29 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Instantly he prayed that God would help him stop the bicycle </div><div class="t mf43 x11 h27 y164c ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">without injury to himself or the other people walking along the </div><div class="t m561 x11 h27 y4c2 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">path. He managed to stop the bicycle and climb off. Trembling, </div><div class="t m2c1 x11 h27 y5f9 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">he pushed the bicycle the rest of the way to the pastor&apos;s home, </div><div class="t mb7c x11 h27 y18a2 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">still able to see only dimly. </div><div class="t m10fe x5d h27 y637 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">To his dismay, the pastor was not home. Peter, his eyes still </div><div class="t m1acf x11 h27 y1889 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">blurry, turned and began pushing the bicycle toward home, squinting </div><div class="t mdf0 x11 h27 yb9c ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and struggling to see the path. Peter suspected that magic had caused </div><div class="t m1146 x11 h27 y28a ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">his near-blindness. As he neared the spot where his eyesight had </div><div class="t mde0 x11 h27 ye32 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">become blurry, he stopped and called out loud, &quot;God, You are more </div><div class="t m1160 x11 h27 y136d ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">powerful than magic. Send the devil away!&quot; At that instant, his </div><div class="t m1493 x11 h27 yb3f ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">eyesight was restored. Then, instead of hurrying away from the place </div><div class="t m5b4 x11 h27 y1f30 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">where Satan had attacked him, Peter stepped into the bushes and </div><div class="t m1a13 x11 h27 y408 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">prayed for several minutes, thanking God for the faith to trust in Him </div><div class="t mdf x11 h27 yefc ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">rather than to fear magic. Then Peter mounted the bicycle and </div><div class="t m1d11 x11 h27 y771 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">continued on his journey. </div><div class="t m4c3 x5d h27 y145e ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Peter did not tell others about his encounter with the powers </div><div class="t md02 x11 h27 y17bd ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of evil. He knew that people in this area believed strongly in the </div><div class="t m720 x11 h27 y2eb ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">powers of the devil, which they call magic. His brush with </div><div class="t m29e x11 h27 y517 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">blindness would only convince them of the devil&apos;s powers, and </div><div class="t maac x11 h27 y47c ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">they would try to fill him with fear of the devil. But when Peter </div><div class="t m1b4 x17 h27 y100c ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">returned to school, he shared his story with his close friend. </div><div class="t m564 x17 h27 yb53 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Peter admitted that now he knows magic is real, that it is the </div><div class="t m7ea x17 h27 yef ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">devil&apos;s power. &quot;But&quot;, he added with a smile, &quot;God really is more </div><div class="t mb3b x17 h27 y2cb ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">powerful than magic!&quot; </div><div class="t md05 x48 h87 y64d ff1 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Beverly H.
