The </div><div class="t m76d x16 h27 y2a9f ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">earnest young man was looking for an Adventist church, so I invited </div><div class="t m1713 x16 h27 y213a ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">him to evangelistic meetings that evening. </div><div class="t m315 x74 h27 y227d ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I arrived at the meeting hall early, and found Sidraque already </div><div class="t m193b x16 h27 y2343 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">waiting. We sat together during the meeting, and afterward I invited </div><div class="t m67c x16 h27 y20a4 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">him to study the Bible with me and see for himself if the Adventist </div><div class="t m45e x16 h27 y99c ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">church taught the truth. He readily agreed. I gave him some Bible </div><div class="t m30e x16 h27 y8ac ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">study guides and invited him to come again the next night. </div><div class="t m1c7d x74 h27 y9d5 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The following evening he brought three cousins with him to the </div><div class="t m796 x16 h27 y2d5 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">evangelistic meeting. After the meeting all four young men stayed to </div><div class="t m16 x71 h27 ycc0 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">review the Bible lesson I had given Sidraque the night before. It took </div><div class="t m3ba x71 h27 y765 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">a long time to cover each lesson, for Sidraque had many questions. </div><div class="t m1bd1 x71 h27 y100f ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">He wanted to understand everything! </div><div class="t m501 x74 h27 y8b0 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">When we studied the lessons on the Ten Commandments and the </div><div class="t m25b x71 h27 y127b ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Sabbath, Sidraque hesitated. He was convinced that the Sabbath was </div><div class="t m1713 x71 h27 y51f ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">God&apos;s holy day, but some of his classes at the military school met on </div><div class="t md2 x71 h27 yb2 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Saturdays, and he could not let his family down. They expected him </div><div class="t m271 x71 h27 y5c3 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to do well, become a professional soldier, and bring honor to the </div><div class="t m21e6 x71 h27 ya2d ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">family. And even though his father knew Sabbath was special, he did </div><div class="t m67c x71 h27 ya46 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">not know how to keep it. Sidraque was not sure what to do; he was </div><div class="t m7f5 x71 h27 y1322 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">not ready to give up his dream of becoming a soldier. </div><div class="t m165e x74 h27 yf7e ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Not long after this he asked me if an Adventist could become a </div><div class="t m1add x71 h27 ycee ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">soldier. I told him, &quot;I know Adventists who are soldiers in the army, </div><div class="t m1494 x71 h27 y2e2 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">but they have difficulties keeping the Sabbath.&quot; </div><div class="t me73 x74 h27 y96e ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">After one Bible study Sidraque asked me how he could learn to </div><div class="t m113c x71 h27 y109 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tell others what he was learning from the Bible. He paused, then </div><div class="t m104 x71 h27 y784 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">asked, &quot;What do I do to become a preacher?&quot; I explained that he </div><div class="t mebf x71 h27 y770 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">would have to study theology for four years to become a minister. </div><div class="t m1897 x61 h27 y4ec ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Not long after that, Sidraque announced, &quot;I have decided to quit </div><div class="t m40d x71 h27 ye8b ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">my military studies.
