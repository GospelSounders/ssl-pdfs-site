Acts 12 is like </div><div class="t m61b x26 h28 y23fb ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">parentheses. It could have started off, &quot;Meanwhile, in Jerusalem . . .&quot; </div><div class="t m9f1 x71 h28 y20e8 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">then proceeded with the story of Peter&apos;s deliverance from prison. The </div><div class="t m79c x71 h28 y209a ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">end of the chapter closes the parentheses, declaring that &quot;Barnabas </div><div class="t mb31 x71 h28 ye92 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and Saul returned from Jerusalem, when they had fulfilled their minis-</div><div class="t m6da x71 h28 y1527 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">try&quot; (12:25). There John Mark joined them to be their helper (Acts </div><div class="t maf2 x26 h28 y13d0 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">12:25; 13:5). Because Mark&apos;s mother frequently opened her home to </div><div class="t mdf x71 h28 y1e23 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the apostles, he would already have spent much time with many of the </div><div class="t m255 x71 h28 y153c ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">well-known people of the early church. </div><div class="t mf9 x61 h22 y10bb ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">What happened with John Mark in Perga? Acts 13:13. What did </div><div class="t mad1 x71 h22 ydc7 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Barnabas propose at a later date? Acts 15:37-39. </div><div class="t m37d x74 h28 ydca ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;This desertion caused Paul to judge Mark unfavorably, and even </div><div class="t m45e x71 h28 y20a9 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">severely, for a time. Barnabas, on the other hand, was inclined to excuse </div><div class="t m6b x71 h28 y1487 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">him because of his inexperience.

But Acts 13:14 perhaps gives us a clue. The </div><div class="t m6a6 x71 h28 y113f ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">road to Pisidian Antioch was located on a plateau 3,600 feet (1,080 </div><div class="t m6e8 x71 h28 y1f9b ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">meters) above sea level. The only road there was a difficult passage </div><div class="t m2ea x71 h28 yecb ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">through the Taurus mountains. And if that wasn&apos;t bad enough, the </div><div class="t m707 x71 h28 y1053 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">route was haunted by criminals.
