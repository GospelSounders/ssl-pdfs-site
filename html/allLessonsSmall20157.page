He is both Pioneer and Perfecter of </div><div class="t m366 x64 h2d y2daa ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">our faith. </div><div class="t m7d3 x5f h2d y2c14 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Ours is a world where trust often is betrayed.

His human experiences described in Hebrews 2:5-18 </div><div class="t m5fd x61 h2d y2a1d ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">showed Him to be unwavering in steadfastness. So in a world of uncer-</div><div class="t m83e x61 h2d y2aac ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tainty and doubt we may be confident of His unswerving reliability.
