A devout Catholic, Gloria rose </div><div class="t me6a x5d h27 y2a48 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">early every morning to spend time with the Lord before begin-</div><div class="t m1645 x48 h27 y2437 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ning her daily tasks. </div><div class="t m13b1 x4e h27 y21bb ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Rosa Ramos, Gloria&apos;s neighbor, noticed her devotion and spoke </div><div class="t m136b x48 h27 y2350 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to her about the second coming of Jesus. Gloria was impressed </div><div class="t md27 x48 h27 y209e ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and wanted to know more, so Rosa enrolled her in Bible studies. </div><div class="t m259 x48 h27 y832 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Gloria then began to share what she learned with others, begin-</div><div class="t m252 x48 h27 y14a9 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ning with her two children and some friends. Eventually several </div><div class="t m628 x48 h27 y15de ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">people joined the family of the Lord and became links in the </div><div class="t m1199 x48 h27 y374 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">chain that never ends. </div><div class="t m1d79 x4e h27 y593 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Gloria moved to another part of Madrid and there continued to </div><div class="t m865 x48 h27 y793 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">share her faith with others. Mary Lazaro listened to what Gloria </div><div class="t m246 x48 h27 y1cf8 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">had to say. Mary&apos;s husband had left her and their four children for </div><div class="t med9 x48 h27 y218a ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">another woman. Through Mary&apos;s difficulties, Gloria encouraged </div><div class="t m44a x48 h27 y859 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">her and told her about Christ. </div><div class="t m561 x4e h27 y1269 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Gloria invited me to study the Bible with Mary and her. Each </div><div class="t m4d2 x48 h27 yd71 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">week before we began our Bible study we shared the victories </div><div class="t m1fe x48 h27 y11a6 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and answered prayers in Mary&apos;s life. Her oldest son suffered </div><div class="t m5d8 x48 h27 y1f71 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">from asthma, and now he is well. Her youngest son&apos;s nervous </div><div class="t m1062 x48 h27 y1781 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">disorder has improved. And her second son, who had gone with </div><div class="t m156b x73 h27 y206b ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">his father, is now with her, and they were renewing their mother-</div><div class="t m8b5 x48 h27 yc7b ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">son relationship. There was another problem: Mary smoked and </div><div class="t m5f2 x48 h27 y746 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">confessed that she could not leave it, although she knew she </div><div class="t mcfd x73 h27 y12a4 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">needed to. One night after our Bible Study we prayed especially </div><div class="t m19f3 x73 h27 yfa0 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that the Lord would give Mary the strength to quit smoking. The </div><div class="t m874 x73 h27 yb40 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">next week when we met, Mary told me that after my prayer she </div><div class="t mce9 x73 h27 yefb ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">felt God&apos;s strength and had quit smoking. </div><div class="t m601 x60 h27 y100a ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">We continued our Bible studies, and in time Mary and three of </div><div class="t m881 x73 h27 y1e3a ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">her children were baptized.
