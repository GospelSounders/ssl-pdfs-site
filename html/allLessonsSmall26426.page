He was a quiet boy who worked hard. His </div><div class="t m44c x71 h27 y2994 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">father worked for an Adventist farmer, and when Cicero was 12 </div><div class="t m76d x71 h27 y28dc ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">years old, the farmer invited him to work on the farm, too. </div><div class="t m474 x74 h27 y234a ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Cicero proved to be an honest and faithful worker, and the farmer&apos;s </div><div class="t m99e x71 h27 y1ea9 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">family invited him to live with them. When the family went to the city, </div><div class="t m25cf x71 h27 ydd7 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">they trusted Cicero to take care of the farm. They often talked to Cicero </div><div class="t m8dd x71 h27 y132f ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">about God and invited him to attend church with them. Thus Cicero </div><div class="t m25cb x71 h27 y1d46 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">met God. He had never attended school, but he taught himself to read </div><div class="t m1572 x71 h27 ye97 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">so he could read the Bible with his new family. Often the farmer saw </div><div class="t mde0 x71 h27 y1083 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Cicero standing among the trees, preaching to an invisible audience. </div><div class="t mf6b x74 h27 y10b7 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Cicero was baptized when he was 16. He enjoyed taking part in </div><div class="t m1ad2 x71 h27 y144e ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">church activities and dreamed that one day he would preach in church. </div><div class="t m317 x71 h27 y11dd ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The lay elders often preached when the pastor was absent. Finally, </div><div class="t me89 x71 h27 y1418 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Cicero found the courage to offer to preach. He carefully wrote his </div><div class="t m1d06 x71 h27 y130d ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">own sermon. After that he often preached. </div><div class="t m1630 x74 h27 y1173 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">As they worked together on the farm, Cicero talked to his younger </div><div class="t me05 x71 h27 yf29 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">brothers, Jose, 15, and Ricardo, 13, about God and invited them to </div><div class="t m2f5 x71 h27 y109b ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">attend church with him. </div><div class="t mfb6 x74 h27 y1cc6 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">One day Jose and Ricardo were weeding when they heard a noise </div><div class="t m1bd2 x71 h27 y13f9 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and looked up to see Cicero stumbling toward them. The boys ran to </div><div class="t ma31 x71 h27 y1243 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">their brother. They saw that he was sick and remembered he had been </div><div class="t m1bdd x71 h27 y19d3 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">spraying insecticide that morning. They realized he must be suffering </div><div class="t m8ed x71 h27 y1457 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">from insecticide poisoning. Ricardo wanted to run for help, but Cicero </div><div class="t m1bad x71 h27 y11c6 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">stopped him. &quot;I am going to sleep now,&quot; Cicero said. &quot;You boys follow </div><div class="t md7a x71 h27 y1cdc ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Jesus and tell everyone to be ready, for His coming is soon. I want to </div><div class="t m14ce x71 h27 y153f ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">see you in heaven.&quot; Cicero was losing consciousness as Ricardo raced </div><div class="t m2e3 x26 h27 y10fb ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">for help. </div><div class="t me44 x61 h27 y74c ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Cicero was unconscious when a neighbor arrived. He loaded the </div><div class="t mdc5 x26 h27 yf43 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">young man into the car for the 20-minute drive to the nearest hospital. </div><div class="t m646 x26 h27 yb83 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">When they arrived doctors tried to revive the boy, but he did not </div><div class="t m138d x26 h27 y118c ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">respond. Within an hour Cicero was dead. </div><div class="t m15c0 x61 h27 y1111 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Ricardo and Jose told their mother what Cicero had said before he </div><div class="t m163d x26 h27 y1dc5 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">died. She had attended church when Cicero preached, but her husband </div><div class="t mcf3 x26 h27 y1463 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">would not permit her to be baptized. After Cicero&apos;s death she did not </div><div class="t m1bae x26 h27 y1d38 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ask permission. She and her children began attending church regularly. </div><div class="t m686 x26 h27 y1ec6 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">She and her daughter and Jose were baptized. Cicero&apos;s testimony led </div><div class="t m1636 x26 h27 yeb3 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">them to Christ.
