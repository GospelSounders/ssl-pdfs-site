Satan had contended that God </div><div class="t m599 x3 he y23ce ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was tyrannical; that created beings were merely automatons. But Satan&apos;s </div><div class="t m119f x3 he y554 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">own choice of rebellion was evidence of the falsity of his argument. When </div><div class="t mbb7 x3 he y16a9 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">man, the regent of this earth, was given the choice between obedience and </div><div class="t m582 x3 he y1b4f ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">disobedience, the righteousness and the liberality of God&apos;s government were </div><div class="t m7e3 x3 he y1bda ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">vindicated. Disobedience does not change the law; it merely determines the </div><div class="t md8 x3 he y18ea ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sequel.
