Do they know who Jesus is? </div><div class="t m287 xb4 h35 y23e ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Do they recognize what it means to be a disciple of Jesus? </div><div class="t m578 xe h35 y170 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">It is the purpose of these lessons to study about Jesus as He relates to His </div><div class="t maa2 xb4 h35 y99d ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">people here on earth. Hopefully in this way we can appreciate more fully what </div><div class="t m842 xb4 h35 yab ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">He has done for us, and respond to Him in a more meaningful way. </div><div class="t m751 xe h35 y434 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">We see Jesus as Sovereign Lord, Creator of heaven and earth, worthy of wor-</div><div class="t m614 xb4 h35 y14e ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ship and all praise. We see Him challenged by the covering cherub, a creature </div><div class="t m56 xb4 h35 y1ce ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">who is described as being &quot;full of wisdom, and perfect in beauty.&quot; See Ezek. 28:12-</div><div class="t m66f xb4 h35 yae7 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">14. How Satan came to do this, we cannot understand, but Isaiah tells us that pride </div><div class="t m351 xb4 h35 ycc8 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">entered his heart. See Isa. 14:12-14. He thought he could set his throne above the </div><div class="t m754 xb4 h35 y4d4 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">stars and be like the Most High. </div><div class="t m731 x92 h35 yc46 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The subject of the controversy is God&apos;s character. Is God all-loving? Is He </div><div class="t mb49 xb4 h35 y2de ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">absolutely fair? Can perfect love and perfect justice exist meaningfully side by side? </div><div class="t m2ea x92 h35 y265 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Jesus took up the challenge. As Michael the Archangel, He fought with Satan </div><div class="t m9a3 xb4 h35 y2bb ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and the third of the angels who had been deceived. See Rev. 12:7, 8. As might </div><div class="t m72a xb4 h35 y24c ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">be expected, there was no room in heaven for deception and falsehood. </div><div class="t m204 x92 h35 ycbe ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The conflict was transferred to this earth. Satan succeeded in deceiving Eve </div><div class="t m6d5 xb4 h35 y1a2 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and in causing Adam to follow in the path of disobedience. But God was not </div><div class="t ma08 xb4 h35 ye2 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">caught unawares. He had a plan for man&apos;s salvation, a plan that would reveal </div><div class="t md0c xb4 h35 y2a5 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">God&apos;s true character. </div><div class="t mb7f x92 h35 y94b ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Down through the ages God has communicated with man in various ways. </div><div class="t m79c xb4 h35 y33e ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Satan has had his counterfeit communications, but God&apos;s word has not been lost. </div><div class="t m15e xda h35 y1dc ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Finally, God sent His Son, born of a virgin, and the express image of the Father. </div><div class="t m27b xb4 h35 ya3b ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">He went about doing good, and gave His life a ransom for many. Satan did his </div><div class="t m74f xda h35 yba0 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">best to prevent this final revelation of God&apos;s love, but he failed. </div><div class="t m111 x92 h35 y454 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Satan now tries to destroy God&apos;s people, and especially so as he recognizes </div><div class="t m750 xda h35 y272 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that his time is short. How are God&apos;s people to respond to this situation? It is </div><div class="t mcf2 xda h35 y22 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the purpose of these lessons to indicate some of the strategies of the enemy and </div><div class="t m2cc xda h35 y505 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to show that, in spite of tremendous odds, God&apos;s people will triumph if they will </div><div class="t mf70 xda h35 y8a9 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">take up the challenge that is theirs and follow in the footsteps of the Master in </div><div class="t m1f0 xda h35 ya65 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the strength which He alone can provide. </div><div class="t me80 x15 h35 y733 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">It is the prayer of those who have compiled these lessons that Paul&apos;s petition </div><div class="t ma96 xda h35 y383 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">for the Ephesians (Eph. 1:17-23) may be fulfilled in the experience of every student. </div></div><div class="pi" data-data='{"ctm":[1.000000,0.000000,0.000000,1.000000,0.000000,0.000000]}'></div></div>
