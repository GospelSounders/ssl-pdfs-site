As the &quot;Word&quot; of </div><div class="t m383 xb9 h35 y2389 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">God, Jesus was concerned about making the mind and heart of God clear to man; as </div><div class="t m8a8 xb9 h35 y22b5 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the &quot;Son of man,&quot; His chief goal was to convince the universe that the happiest, </div><div class="t m915 xb9 h35 y2053 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">safest, and healthiest way to live is God&apos;s way. Any theological subject worth consid-</div><div class="t m681 xb9 h35 y23d ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ering should be some aspect of what Jesus made clear regarding God in His relation </div><div class="t m1f6 xb9 h35 y57d ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to sin and the sinner. </div><div class="t m407 x27 h35 y5af ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Over the centuries great biblical themes have become isolated from their connec-</div><div class="t m57c xb9 h35 y29a ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tion with Jesus. The major reason for this misunderstanding is that Christian thinkers </div><div class="t m371 xb9 h35 y1c04 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">became confused about Jesus. The misunderstanding by Christian thinkers of Jesus&apos; </div><div class="t mbb7 xb9 h35 yd1 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">identity, origin, mission, and intercession seems automatically to warp and distort </div><div class="t m451 x3 h35 yd4 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">their view of every other biblical topic. </div><div class="t m305 x27 h35 y4c0 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">This quarter we shall study Jesus as man&apos;s model in every respect. There is nothing </div><div class="t m213 x3 h35 y13df ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that God asks of men and women for which He has not already provided a living </div><div class="t m398 x3 h35 y3ba ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">demonstration in Jesus Christ. &quot;We are to look to the man Christ Jesus, who is </div><div class="t m15d x3 h35 y847 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">complete in the perfection of righteousness and holiness. He is the author and </div><div class="t mb8b x3 h35 yb02 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">finisher of our faith. He is the pattern man. His experience is the measure of the </div><div class="t m111e xb9 h35 y177 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">experience that we are to gain. His character is our model. Let us, then, take our </div><div class="t mf23 x3 h35 y1b9 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">minds off the perplexities and the difficulties of this life, and fix them on Him, that by </div><div class="t m3d5 x3 h35 y1f6 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">beholding we may be changed into His likeness. We may behold Christ to good </div><div class="t m629 x3 h35 y6ff ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">purpose. We may safely look to Him; for He is all-wise.
