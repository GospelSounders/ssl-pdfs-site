The entire village soon </div><div class="t m4e x26 h27 y2456 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">appeared to see the foreigner from America. The village chief, </div><div class="t m7d8 x26 h27 y238f ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Tibulawan, welcomed me.

The first-grade students ranged in age from 6 to 20, all </div><div class="t m3d8 x18 h27 y7a5 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">learning to read and write together.
