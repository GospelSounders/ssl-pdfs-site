The day of miracles is not over.

It would take two hours to peel and boil a sweet potato </div><div class="t m82e x11 h28 y1ccd ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">for lunch, and Edwin was not sure he could wait that long to eat. </div><div class="t m248 x11 h28 y46b ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">As he walked, he remembered that his Friend, Jesus, knew all </div><div class="t m36d x11 h28 y12cf ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">about his growling stomach. He stopped along the path, closed his </div><div class="t m7d4 x11 h28 yf04 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">eyes, and told God how hungry he was. He did not ask God for </div><div class="t m983 x17 h28 y1d4e ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">food; he knew that Jesus would know what to do about his </div><div class="t m288 x11 h28 y1be ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">problem. </div><div class="t m66d x5d h28 y366 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">As Edwin began walking again he heard a bird singing in the </div><div class="t m23b x11 h28 y76d ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tree overhead.

He </div><div class="t m1226 x17 h28 y1440 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">walked over to pick up the leaf, and noticed a little bundle lying on </div><div class="t m858 x17 h28 y1d54 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the ground near where the leaf had fallen. He bent down to </div><div class="t m9b4 x17 h28 y1a41 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">examine the bundle and found two nicely-made sandwiches. He </div><div class="t m86f x17 h28 yc9d ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">looked around, but saw no one nearby who could own the lunch. </div><div class="t me29 x48 h28 y54a ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Edwin picked up the bundle and held it in his hands. While his </div><div class="t m32d x17 h28 y66d ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">stomach growled for food, he closed his eyes and thanked Jesus </div><div class="t mf56 x17 h28 yf49 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">for providing lunch for him. Then he sat down and enjoyed the </div><div class="t m3ce x17 h28 y1855 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">meal that Jesus had left for him.
