He claims many of the prerogatives of </div><div class="t mb8a x74 he y372 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">God. This language reminds us of Daniel 11:36, and suggests that Paul and </div><div class="t m57f x74 he y1b0 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Daniel are referring to the same phenomenon. It was to appear after the apostolic </div><div class="t m325 x74 he ydc2 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">age. Paul says: &quot;Let no one deceive you&quot; (2 Thess 2:3).
