The Old Tes-</div><div class="t m396 x14 h28 y2384 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tament mentions women only a fraction of the time that it mentions </div><div class="t m612 x14 h28 y20f2 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">men. Three books—Obadiah, Habakkuk, and Haggai—do not refer </div><div class="t m5fd x14 h28 yda8 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to women at all. The names of 32 men are found in the title of Bible </div><div class="t m764 x14 h28 yf1c ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">books, whereas just two women have been given that honor. </div><div class="t m451 x29 h28 yec0 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">But the Bible is not concerned with percentages of representation. </div><div class="t m811 x14 h28 y922 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Nor is it concerned with depicting a male-dominated world. Consid-</div><div class="t m51f x14 h28 ybcc ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ering women&apos;s position in society during Bible times, women were </div><div class="t m3dd x14 h28 ydae ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">well represented. The principles that their stories teach have great </div><div class="t m7d3 x14 h28 y65e ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">value for us today. The Bible presents the stories of people—men, </div><div class="t m853 x14 h28 ya42 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">women, and children—who respond positively to, or reject, God&apos;s </div><div class="t m814 x5d h28 ydc8 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">leading. The Scriptures tell the stories of those who accept or spurn </div><div class="t m8a8 x5d h28 y1233 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the divine call to lead godlike lives under all conditions and circum-</div><div class="t m455 x14 h28 y12cd ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">stances. To dwell on the fact that Bible times may have been male- or </div><div class="t m227 x5d h28 y15f1 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">adult-oriented is to miss the point. God looks for people who will </div><div class="t m422 x5d h28 y980 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">live for Him and depict His love through concrete action wherever </div><div class="t m1a3 x5d h28 yad6 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">they are, whatever the time and situation. </div><div class="t m26a x36 h28 y10a9 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">During this quarter we will study the books of Ruth and Esther. </div><div class="t mac4 x5d h28 yd08 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Their main characters include several women. But they present more </div><div class="t m102 x5d h28 y95c ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">than just stories about women—they present stories of women, and </div><div class="t m656 x5d h28 yd76 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">also men, who lived for God despite difficult and trying circum-</div><div class="t m3e3 x5d h28 y933 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">stances. These women and men represented Him and His love in a </div><div class="t m13e x5d h28 y860 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">world of tragedy, injustice, and danger. </div><div class="t m7d7 x36 h28 y527 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Naomi struggled with the question of why God seemingly allowed </div><div class="t me8c x5d h28 y548 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the tragedy of death to sweep her family away. Esther lived in a time </div><div class="t mf37 x5d h28 y10ad ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">when the very existence of God&apos;s people seemed to be at stake.
