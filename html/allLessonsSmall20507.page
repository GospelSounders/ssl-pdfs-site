But for the Christian being awakened in the special resur-</div><div class="t m31d x64 he y2e6f ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">rection or at the second coming of Jesus involves a change. (See I Cor. 15:51, </div><div class="t m167 x64 he y2a3d ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">52.)

Not </div><div class="t m45f x61 he y62b ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">everyone rises to points of excellence. In a race or other athletic event only one </div><div class="t m6ea x61 he y1acb ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">receives the &quot;gold.&quot; But in the Christian race all run and all may win.
