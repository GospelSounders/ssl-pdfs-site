An Adventist woman stood in a long line to </div><div class="t me4b x48 h27 y2456 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">buy milk. When she finally reached the front of the line, she gave </div><div class="t m1081 x48 h27 y23a2 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">her order and paid the clerk for her milk. But the clerk gave her </div><div class="t m1761 x48 h27 y1615 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">too much in change. When she tried to return the extra money, the </div><div class="t m5cb x48 h27 y1eb ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">clerk brushed her aside; she was busy with another customer. The </div><div class="t mdf7 x48 h27 y8ca ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">woman waited quietly until the clerk had finished with the cus-</div><div class="t m4ce x48 h27 y16f ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tomer, then called her attention to the overpayment. The clerk </div><div class="t m407 x48 h27 y1920 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">took the money, thanked her curtly, then turned to the next cus-</div><div class="t m1857 x48 h27 y229 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tomer. The Adventist woman smiled and turned to leave the store. </div><div class="t m1d01 x60 h27 y2d7 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Two students standing in line had watched her. They wondered </div><div class="t m1717 x48 h27 y4fc ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">why this woman returned the money. Most people would have </div><div class="t m8a x73 h27 y60e ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">been glad for some extra change! </div><div class="t mac0 x60 h27 y331 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The following day the woman stood near the front of the same </div><div class="t mefc x73 h27 y623 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">line when a weary young mother carrying a little child in her arm </div><div class="t mce2 x48 h27 y485 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">approached the front of the line. When the clerk saw her, she </div><div class="t m5aa x73 h27 ydc3 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">scolded her sharply and demanded that she wait in line like </div><div class="t m45c x73 h27 y8d ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">everyone else. The Adventist woman felt sorry for the weary </div><div class="t m43d x73 h27 yff ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">young mother and offered her place in line. Then she walked to </div><div class="t m354 x73 h27 y24a ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the end of the line and began her wait all over. </div><div class="t m134e x60 h27 y849 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The same two students who had seen the money incident the </div><div class="t m86f x73 h27 y2bd ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">previous day, watched in amazement as this Christian woman </div><div class="t me3a x73 h27 y4e7 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">again acted generously to a stranger. They decided they had to </div><div class="t md30 x73 h27 y38c ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">know what motives prompted such unusual behavior. They fol-</div><div class="t m40b x73 h27 ye2 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">lowed the woman home and explained that they had seen her in </div><div class="t m409 x73 h27 y55e ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the market. They wondered why she was so different. She invited </div><div class="t m3f2 x73 h27 y8e6 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">them into her home and answered their questions. During their </div><div class="t m131d x73 h27 y31f ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">conversation, she shared her faith in Jesus. As the students were </div><div class="t m770 x73 h27 yc2 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">leaving, she invited them to come back again. </div><div class="t md02 x5f h27 ya62 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The students returned several times.
