Here we </div><div class="t m1692 x61 h2b y35e ff4 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">have the very well which Jacob dug and the one by which our Lord sat, </div><div class="t m1a5 x61 h2b y1277 ff4 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">travel-worn and thirsty. </div><div class="t m1708 x34 h2b ya6 ff4 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Some years ago the Greek Church got possession of the well and </div><div class="t mb80 x61 h2b y29a ff4 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">began to build a church over it. The war and the revolution in Russia </div><div class="t m1575 x61 h2b yd0 ff4 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">cut off the funds, so only the foundation story has been finished. We </div><div class="t m1008 x61 h2b y4bf ff4 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">went down the steps, and there we found the well. It is one hundred </div><div class="t mb4c x61 h2b y1c9 ff4 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">feet deep, and has twelve feet of water. As the old man who keeps the </div><div class="t me12 x61 h2b y349 ff4 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">place threw his light into the well, we could plainly see the bubbling of </div><div class="t m12d8 x61 h2b y2fc ff4 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the living fountain of water that has supplied the thirsty for so many </div><div class="t m104c x74 h2b y5b3 ff4 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">centuries. Such watering places are scarce in Palestine. No wonder the </div><div class="t m1709 x61 h2b y55a ff4 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Samaritans honored the name of &apos;our father Jacob, which gave us the </div><div class="t m578 x61 h2b y2b5 ff4 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">well.&apos; </div><div class="t m1dda xc5 h2b y6ea ff4 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;The attendant drew some water by means of a windlass and we </div><div class="t md2c x74 h2b ye1a ff4 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">quenched our thirst. And we thanked God in our hearts, as we stood </div><div class="t m1055 x61 h2b y624 ff4 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">there, for that &apos;living water&apos; which Jesus promised the sinful woman. </div><div class="t m6dc x61 h2b y6fe ff4 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Coming up from the well, we looked across the little ravine and up the </div><div class="t md9 x74 h2b y336 ff4 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">gentle slope to the little town which is doubtless on or near the spot where </div><div class="t me93 x74 h2b yff ff4 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Sychar stood. We could see in our imagination the crowds of people </div><div class="t m6bd x74 h2b y19f ff4 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">coming down the slope to see the marvelous Man concerning whom the </div><div class="t m1975 x61 h2b y206b ff4 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Samaritan woman had told them. And we seemed to hear Jesus say, </div><div class="t m186e x74 h2b y8a5 ff4 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">`Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields; for they are white already </div><div class="t me88 x74 h2b y365 ff4 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to harvest.&apos;&quot; </div><div class="t m821 xc5 h2b y2be ff4 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">3. </div><div class="t m1018 x53 h2b ya58 ff4 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Who came to the well to draw water?
