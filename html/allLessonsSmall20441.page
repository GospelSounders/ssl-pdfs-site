THE TEST (Dan. 3:1-18). </div><div class="t mb1e x4e he y2ef8 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The forces of good and the forces of evil stand in conflict in this world. It is </div><div class="t md2e x74 he y2e9e ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">important for us to recognize these forces, and to choose to be on God&apos;s side. </div><div class="t m1dc x4e h1 y2965 ff1 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">1. Attempt to Thwart God&apos;s Revealed Purpose (Dan. 3:1-12). </div><div class="t m310 x4e he y2b04 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">It seems ridiculous for human beings to think that they can oppose the power </div><div class="t mcfd x74 he y298c ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of God. Yet this happens often. We see it in the case of Nebuchadnezzar. We see </div><div class="t m75b x74 he y2377 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">how opposition arises out of selfish interest. </div><div class="t md28 x4e h1 y18f8 ff1 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">What was the significance of the image that Nebuchadnezzar erected on </div><div class="t m319 x74 h1 y1ec8 ff1 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the plain of Dura near Babylon? Dan. 3:1-3. </div><div class="t m7e3 x4e he y17d3 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">It is almost impossible not to see a link between the image that was set up in </div><div class="t m3f0 x74 he y1ff5 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Dura and the image the king had seen in his dream. But there was one significant </div><div class="t m77e x74 he y1fc3 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">difference; whereas the image in the dream had been composed of various met-</div><div class="t mf42 x73 he y1a78 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">als, the image set up in the plain was made of one metal—gold. When interpret-</div><div class="t m3d8 x74 he y1a44 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ing the dream Daniel had said that the head of gold represented King Nebuchad-</div><div class="t m131d x74 he y1e35 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">nezzar and his dynasty. It had also been pointed out that another kingdom would </div><div class="t m7e2 x73 he y19d1 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">succeed Babylon, a kingdom inferior, but nevertheless a different kingdom. </div><div class="t m14ab x73 he yc1d ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Nebuchadnezzar accepted the interpretation of the dream as a supernatural rev-</div><div class="t m2ff x73 he y1e2b ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">elation. He recognized the God of Daniel as the great Revealer of secrets. But </div><div class="t m1adc x73 he y1b60 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the concept that another kingdom would succeed his did not please him. </div><div class="t m5f9 x28 he y10d7 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">There was nothing secret or hidden about the happenings surrounding the </div><div class="t m85e x73 he y1a48 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">dream and its interpretation. For one thing, all the scholars in Babylon owed </div><div class="t m76e x73 he y1ff7 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">their lives to Daniel and certainly would have been told about his revelation of </div><div class="t m134d x73 he y15d0 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the dream and its meaning to the king. The promotion of Daniel to high office in </div><div class="t m393 x73 he yc23 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the land provided abundant evidence that the king had received an answer to his </div><div class="t m21d x73 he y1fb0 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">request. </div><div class="t mb5a x73 h1 y1a93 ff1 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ILLUMINATION: </div><div class="t m274 x42 he y1e73 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;For a time afterward [after the dream], Nebuchadnezzar </div><div class="t m428 x73 he y1053 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was influenced by the fear of God; but his heart was not yet cleansed from </div><div class="t m220 x73 he y20bf ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">worldly ambition and a desire for self-exaltation. The prosperity attending his </div><div class="t m3f0 x73 he y640 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">reign filled him with pride. In time he ceased to honor God, and resumed his idol </div><div class="t m6b x73 he y214e ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">worship with increased zeal and bigotry. . . . The wise men of his realm, taking </div><div class="t m68f x73 he yb47 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">advantage of this and of his return to idolatry, proposed that he make an image </div><div class="t m165e x73 he y1a97 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">similar to the one seen in his dream, and set it up where all might behold the head </div><div class="t m356 x73 he y2155 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of gold, which had been interpreted as representing his kingdom. </div><div class="t mb1e x28 he y1637 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Pleased with the flattering suggestion, he determined to carry it out, and to </div><div class="t m74e x73 he y1a51 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">go even farther.
