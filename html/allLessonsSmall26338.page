His wife worked in the office of the </div><div class="t m846 x26 h22 y299e ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">commander of the Peruvian police force. The man was an Adventist, </div><div class="t mbed x26 h22 y2289 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and now his wife was becoming interested in the Adventist church. In </div><div class="t m64a x26 h22 y20e6 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">fact, she joined a small group that her boss had started. She talked </div><div class="t maec x26 h22 y203e ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">about the singing, fellowship, Bible reading, and prayer time. One day </div><div class="t ma31 x26 h22 y18d7 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Montoya told his wife, &quot;This interest in religion must stop. You must </div><div class="t m20dd x26 h22 y1f17 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">choose between that small group and me.&quot; </div><div class="t m18ec x64 h22 y2032 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">She continued attending the small group meetings in spite of her </div><div class="t m408 x26 h22 y1f0c ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">husband&apos;s threats. Soon she began rising early on Sabbath mornings </div><div class="t m1680 x26 h22 y1533 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">while he was still asleep and quietly slipping out to attend the Adventist </div><div class="t m5b3 x26 h22 y153d ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">worship services as well. But one Sabbath her husband awoke and </div><div class="t m1955 x18 h22 y1086 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">followed her to church. He was determined to find out what was so </div><div class="t m1cf8 x26 h22 y1242 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">compelling about the Adventists. Captain Montoya attended the wor-</div><div class="t m2f85 x26 h22 ydc8 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ship service that day and has not stopped attending since then. He was </div><div class="t m17f1 x26 h22 y1233 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">baptized in 1996. </div><div class="t m1a0d x64 h22 y12f4 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Recently I visited Captain Montoya at his police station. I watched </div><div class="t mf9 x26 h22 y11a5 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">as a new shift of officers came on duty. Some 24 officers stood at </div><div class="t m166f x18 h22 y10d9 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">attention as a short devotional was presented. Then they sang an </div><div class="t m1a11 x18 h22 yea1 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">enthusiastic gospel song. After closing prayer they received their </div><div class="t m1306 x18 h22 y1eaf ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">orders for the evening. </div><div class="t m1485 x64 h22 y13fc ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Later Montoya said, &quot;I want my officers to follow the principles of </div><div class="t mf23 x18 h22 y1ce2 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">God&apos;s Word. None of us receive high salaries. There is always a </div><div class="t m161c x18 h22 y117b ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">temptation to accept bribes. I tell my officers, &apos;If you take so much as </div><div class="t me56 x18 h22 y1312 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">one cent, you will lose your job and your soul.
