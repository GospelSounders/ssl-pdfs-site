It is rooted in the desire to live our lives independently of </div><div class="t mcd x71 h27 y2291 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">God. God&apos;s judgment is that &quot;the soul who sins shall die&quot; (Ezek. 18:4, </div><div class="t mdb7 x71 h27 yed8 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">NKJV). God does not desire to bring that judgment upon us sinners. </div><div class="t mee x71 h27 y832 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Rather, Jesus chose to take that death sentence upon Himself so that </div><div class="t m8dd x71 h27 y206e ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">He may give us life eternal at His return. </div><div class="t m179 x74 h27 y1cef ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">What caused Jesus to cry </div><div class="t m8b5 x2a h87 y1cef ff1 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">out in anguish to His Father?
