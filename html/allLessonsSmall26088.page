He placed an ad in the local newspaper, inviting anyone inter-</div><div class="t m349 x18 h22 yb7c ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ested in reading the Bible to come to his home. Soon he had a small </div><div class="t mafd x18 h22 yf33 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">group meeting each week. After several weeks three persons were </div><div class="t m2641 x18 h22 yadb ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">baptized.
