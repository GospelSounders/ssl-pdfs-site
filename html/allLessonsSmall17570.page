Man&apos;s greatest need is to understand </div><div class="t md30 x4 h35 y385 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Him better.and to have God&apos;simage restored in him. Without such an understanding </div><div class="t m574 x4 h35 y602 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">it is not possible for man to be truly happy or to be at peace with himself or his fellows. </div><div class="t m5c9 x4 h35 y32f ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Because men failed to understand God and because they failed to recognize Him and </div><div class="t m136c x4 h35 ycf ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">give Him the homage that is His due, humanity has brought woe upon itself and doom </div><div class="t mb97 x4 h35 y25b ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">upon the world. </div><div class="t m2d5 x17 h35 y240 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">In the Bible God has given a revelation of Himself through His witnesses—the </div><div class="t m9d0 x4 h35 y5cf ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">patriarchs, the prophets, and the apostles.
