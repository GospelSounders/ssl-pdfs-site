Several principles of biblical interpretation are especially helpful </div><div class="t m463 x11 h27 y2144 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">here: (1) The place, circumstance, and persons to whom the parable is </div><div class="t ma63 x11 h27 y23ea ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">spoken are keys to its meaning. (2) Because a parable usually illus-</div><div class="t m392 x17 h27 y20bd ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">trates one particular truth, no doctrine should be based on the parable. </div><div class="t m10f6 x11 h27 ydf0 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">(3) A parable reflects truth. It is not truth itself. Details of a parable are </div><div class="t m778 x17 h27 y11d1 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">important only as they help us understand the truth reflected in it.
