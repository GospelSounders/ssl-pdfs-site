For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive.&quot; </div><div class="t m1f0 x0 h5 ya7 ff3 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">1 Cor. 15:21, 22. </div><div class="t m1226 x27 h35 y20a ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">All created organisms die. But only man knows about death. He is not only </div><div class="t m1359 x0 h35 yaa ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">daily exposed to death, which affects his whole existence, his life and his </div><div class="t m13d x0 h35 y1ba4 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">thought; but death is to him a daily possibility, and he is constantly aware of it. </div><div class="t m572 x27 h35 y349 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">No scientific explanation has as yet been found as to why man should die. </div><div class="t m664 x0 h35 ya5d ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">What factor is there in man that he, after a while, grows old and dies? Why do </div><div class="t m1ed x0 h35 y580 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">not his living cells continue to multiply themselves, without end, or without </div><div class="t mbc x0 h35 ybc6 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">distortions? It is part of our nature, and we know it. But why? </div><div class="t ma1d x27 h35 y595 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Since this question cannot be answered satisfactorily, the question shifts </div><div class="t m77a x0 h35 y5e4 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to, What is the meaning of death? If there is life, why should there be death? </div><div class="t m1f0 x0 h35 y6c0 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Or if there is death, why should there be life? Does death only prove the fool-</div><div class="t m572 x0 h35 y379 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ishness of life, as some maintain, or the futility of all human endeavor? Or </div><div class="t m257 xb7 h35 y612 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">does it, perhaps, give our sixty or seventy years of existence a special meaning, </div><div class="t m487 x0 h35 y129 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">a special richness, as others have said? But of course no satisfactory answer </div><div class="t mb36 xb7 h35 y2ba ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">can be found to these questions before we have come to grips with these two </div><div class="t m7e9 xb7 h35 y2e0 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">basic questions: Why death? And what is death? </div><div class="t m572 x11 h35 yb ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">In the discussions on death, a distinction should be made between death </div><div class="t m1adc xb7 h35 y37a ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">as the ceasing of life, and death as it relates to the whole human person. Is </div><div class="t m14db xb7 h35 y1bf ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">death, as a cessation of life, also the very end of min? Of course when death </div><div class="t m2 xb7 h35 y38d ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">comes, gone are man&apos;s activities as we know them: his laughter, his love, his </div><div class="t m264 xb7 h35 y28b ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">praises, his thoughts. The Biblical testimony on that issue is clear. But is death </div><div class="t m567 xb7 h35 y24e ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">also the end of man? In other words, is death the same as nothingness? Few, </div><div class="t m27c xb7 h35 y232 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">very few indeed, have considered death to be nothingness. But on the question </div><div class="t m67b xb7 h35 y15d ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of the condition of man in death no unanimous opinion exists among Christians. </div><div class="t m5af xb7 h35 y182 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">In fact, they range from the view that at death an entity called &quot;soul&quot; or &quot;spirit&quot; </div><div class="t mce3 xb9 h35 yc1 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">leaves the body to be preserved until the resurrection, to the view that man as </div><div class="t m5dc xb7 h35 y9af ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">a whole rests until the day when he is called to life again. These views are </div><div class="t m84b xb9 h35 y6e ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">based on the Biblical idea that death is not the end of man, but a time of rest, a </div><div class="t m1639 xb9 h35 y19fb ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">condition of transition to a new form of existence. Also on the question, Why </div><div class="t m2fd xb9 h35 y84d ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">should men die? exists general consensus among Christians. There remains </div><div class="t me55 xb9 h35 y36b ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">only, and in particular, the question therefore, What happens to man at death? </div><div class="t m453 xb9 h35 y111 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">What is his condition during that period of transition from life to life? In short, </div><div class="t m149a xb9 h35 y274 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">What is death? Let us, in this lesson, prayerfully consider the Biblical answers </div><div class="t mce1 xb9 h35 y2c9 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to these important questions. For not only is it the lot of all men once to die, </div><div class="t m8d xb9 h35 y49d ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">but also man&apos;s whole attitude toward life is largely shaped, if not determined, </div><div class="t me1a xb9 h35 yc66 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">by his attitude toward death. </div><div class="t m1135 xb9 h5 y951 ff3 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">LESSON OUTLINE </div><div class="t m23f x3 h5 y2cd ff3 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">1. </div><div class="t m460 x17 h5 y2cd ff3 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">A Result of Sin, Gen. 2:7; 15-17 </div><div class="t m558 x3 h5 y2037 ff3 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">2. </div><div class="t m7ea x3e h5 y6c4 ff3 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Condition in Death, Eccl. 12:7; Mark 15:37 </div><div class="t mb7 x3 h5 y55 ff3 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">3. </div><div class="t mb6 x3e h5 y55 ff3 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The Punishment for Sin, Rev. 21:8 </div><div class="t m1ce x3 h5 y889 ff3 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">4. </div><div class="t mb41 x3e h5 y889 ff3 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Jesus, Our Substitute, Matt. 27:50-54 </div><div class="t m8a8 x3 h5 y464 ff3 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">5. </div><div class="t m1e8 x3e h5 y464 ff3 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Baptized Into His Death, Rom. 6:1-4 </div><div class="t m2ef x3 h5 y2dfd ff3 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">6. </div><div class="t m1488 x3e h5 y2dfd ff3 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Jesus&apos; Death Reenacted, 1 Car. 15:31 </div></div><div class="pi" data-data='{"ctm":[1.000000,0.000000,0.000000,1.000000,0.000000,0.000000]}'></div></div>
