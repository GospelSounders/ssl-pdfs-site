Isa. 53:6. </div><div class="t m8dd x5d h2d y7a8 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">NOTE.—When a whole flock goes astray, it is generally because the </div><div class="t m43d x27 h2d y1699 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">leaders have gone astray. Let the first sheep lead the way, and all the </div><div class="t m522 x11 h2d ye84 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">rest follow. While God does not excuse those who have thus gone after </div><div class="t m167 x27 h2d y927 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">their own way, He understands that the chief responsibility is upon </div><div class="t m250 x11 h2d y53 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the leaders. </div><div class="t m318 x5d h2d y14bb ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;The Lord bath laid on Him the iniquity of us all.&quot; &quot;Whether they </div><div class="t md15 x11 h2d y4e0 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">know it or not, all are weary and heavy-laden. All are weighed down </div><div class="t m146f x27 h2d y6cf ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">with burdens that only Christ can remove. The heaviest burden that </div><div class="t m3e0 x27 h2d y83d ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">we bear is the burden of sin.

He will take the load from our weary </div><div class="t mddc x27 h2d y56b ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">shoulders. He will give us rest. The burden of care and sorrow also </div><div class="t m1b0 x27 h2d y3d4 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">He will bear.

Verse 7. </div><div class="t m252 x14 h2d y96e ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">NOTE.—&quot;He was oppressed.&quot; The word denotes harsh, cruel, and </div><div class="t mff x27 h2d y2e4 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">arbitrary treatment, such as that of a slave driver. The same word </div><div class="t m38a x27 h2d y862 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">is used in Exodus 3:7. </div><div class="t m13e x14 h2d yaf2 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;As a lamb to the slaughter.&quot; Christ&apos;s trial was neither just nor </div><div class="t m3d9 x27 h2d y181 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">legal.

No word did He utter in self-defense. At last </div><div class="t m76c x27 h2d yaf5 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">His accusers were entangled, confused, and maddened.
