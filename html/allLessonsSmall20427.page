None of us have </div><div class="t mdd5 x74 he y2e07 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">reason to complain about our lot. Instead, all of us have every reason to thank </div><div class="t m881 x74 he y2c22 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">God for His providences. </div><div class="t m869 x74 h1 y28c1 ff1 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I. JUSTICE. </div><div class="t m15b x4e he y288c ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Abraham once asked the rhetorical question: &quot;Shall not the Judge of all the </div><div class="t m1717 x74 he y23ba ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">earth do right?&quot; (Gen. 18:25). Of course God is just, but in this lesson we want </div><div class="t m1c9 x74 he y17e5 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to take a close look at His justice. </div><div class="t m48b x4e h1 yf8e ff1 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">1. </div><div class="t m774 x65 h1 y2283 ff1 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Hezekiah&apos;s Mistake (2 Kings 20). </div><div class="t m358 x4e he y3fe ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Hezekiah was sick and about to die. Isaiah the prophet told him to set his </div><div class="t m733 x74 he yf90 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">house in order because death was imminent. Hezekiah prayed earnestly that his </div><div class="t ma29 x74 he y19a2 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">life might be spared, and it was. </div><div class="t m778 x73 h1 y5df ff1 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">THINK IT THROUGH: Why did God tell Hezekiah that he was going to die </div><div class="t m9fc x73 h1 y1721 ff1 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">(verse 1), and then give him an extension of fifteen years of life (verse 6)? </div><div class="t m1e4 x73 h1 yc19 ff1 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Was it to teach us something? Was it to point out that we ought to accept </div><div class="t m14c1 x73 h1 y164a ff1 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">God&apos;s providences and not seek to change them? </div><div class="t mcff x4e he y681 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Whatever answers you give to these questions, it is interesting to note that the </div><div class="t m3d9 x73 he y34a ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">healing was confirmed by a sign that involved the sunâ€”or, perhaps technically, </div><div class="t med9 x73 he y1724 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the rotation of the earth. Apparently the Babylonian observers of this remarkable </div><div class="t m487 x73 he y17f3 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sign made inquiries and learned that what they had observed had to do with the </div><div class="t m320 x73 he y19d ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">healing of the King of Judah. A delegation came to make inquiries. (See verse </div><div class="t m1d4 x73 he y1897 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">12.) </div><div class="t m1080 x4e h1 y28a ff1 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Instead of giving God the glory for his marvelous healing, what did Hez-</div><div class="t me4a x74 h1 y182a ff1 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ekiah do? Verse 13. Why do you think he responded that way? </div><div class="t m1226 x4e he yc99 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">God gives us opportunities to tell others of His providences. When we fail to </div><div class="t mf23 x73 he y133 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">do so, we are failing in accomplishing God&apos;s purposes in and through us. This is </div><div class="t md28 x73 he yc29 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">a serious failure, and we should pray that we never disappoint God in this way. </div><div class="t md28 x73 he y1981 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Hezekiah received a strong rebuke through the prophet Isaiah. He was told that </div><div class="t m63f x73 he y28f ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">as a result of his action and inaction the time would come when the king of Judah </div><div class="t m44c x73 he y1925 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">would lose his wealth and influence. Some of Hezekiah&apos;s descendants would be </div><div class="t m2c2 x73 he y19be ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">taken captive to Babylon. Some would become &quot;eunuchs in the palace of the </div><div class="t m1308 x73 he y19f7 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">king of Babylon&quot; (verse 18). </div><div class="t meb x28 he yba1 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">This prediction was made nearly a hundred years before the actual exile and </div><div class="t m453 x73 he y198c ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">captivity. It demonstrates a relationship between what Hezekiah did and what </div><div class="t m517 x73 he y2c7 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">actually happened. Every act has its consequences, for good or ill. Hezekiah had </div><div class="t m6a x73 he y16d8 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">revealed his treasures of wealth but not the treasures of grace for which God was </div><div class="t m40f x73 he y17a7 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">responsible and which were of greater worth than anything this world can offer. </div><div class="t mae7 x28 h1 y1a56 ff1 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">2. </div><div class="t m733 x5b h1 yb5a ff1 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Manasseh&apos;s Crimes (2 Kings 21; 2 Chron. </div><div class="t m23b x76 he y7f ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">33). </div><div class="t m34c x28 he yba9 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Hezekiah undoubtedly was relieved to know that, at least in his own time, </div><div class="t m19f5 x73 h1 y1aa9 ff1 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">there </div><div class="t mb42 x5b he yc73 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">would be peace and security.
