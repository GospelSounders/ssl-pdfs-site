So when he &quot;declares his righteous-</div><div class="t m123 x17 he yf1d ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ness &quot; upon a man who is full of sin, then that man becomes </div><div class="t mad5 x17 he ye95 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">righteous; for whatever God says, must be. God spoke to </div><div class="t m655 x17 he y15df ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">vacancy, and the earth was. He said to the thick darkness, </div><div class="t m8cb x17 he y1240 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot; Let there be light,&quot; and there was light.&quot; To the troubled </div><div class="t m813 x17 he y1dbf ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">waters he said, &quot; Peace, be still,&quot; and immediately there is a </div><div class="t mb81 x17 he y1c57 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">great calm. So he speaks peace to the troubled soul, and </div><div class="t m5d9 x17 he y1e07 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">there is peace. We cannot understand how a man&apos;s leprosy </div><div class="t m53 x17 he y1355 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">can be healed in an instant by a word, but it was done; and it </div><div class="t m134c x17 he y632 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was done to show Christ&apos;s power to cleanse from sin. If we do </div><div class="t m3ad x17 he y1dc0 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">not learn this lesson from the miracle, we read the record in </div><div class="t mf4d x3e he y1172 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">vain. </div><div class="t m104a x14 he y1573 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">3. </div><div class="t ma56 x29 he y1573 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;AND he put forth his hand and touched him.&quot; Note </div><div class="t m782 x3e he y1dc3 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that Jesus was not afraid of the leprosy. Any other person in </div><div class="t mb30 x3e he y12f6 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the country would have run in horror from a leper. No one </div><div class="t m497 x3e he y11c4 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">would have allowed so loathsome an object to come near him. </div><div class="t me9 x3e he y1fbf ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">But Jesus touched him. Disease could not stay a moment after </div><div class="t m91 x3e he y12fa ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">his divine, life-giving touch. This is to show how close Jesus </div><div class="t m200 x3e he y1df3 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">comes to us in our sinfulness. He will not turn away from the </div><div class="t m111 x3e he y10ea ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">vilest. Sin cannot withstand his life-giving touch. If the leper </div><div class="t m1f1 x3e he y746 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">had said, &quot; I am too vile to come into the presence of Jesus,&quot; he </div><div class="t m66d x16 he y1c68 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">would not have been cleansed. Was it not presumption for him </div><div class="t m87c x3e he y1be2 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to come ?—No; it was knowledge of Christ&apos;s power, and confi-</div><div class="t m121 x3e he y1fc0 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">dence in his goodness, that brought him. These are the qual-</div><div class="t m1adf x16 he y1f39 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ities with which the Lord is well pleased. &quot;Thus saith the </div><div class="t ma07 x16 he yd3f ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Lord, Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom, neither let the </div><div class="t m637 x16 he y1540 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">mighty man glory in his might, let not the rich man glory in his </div><div class="t m816 x16 he y13c3 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">riches; but let him that glorieth glory in this, that he under-</div><div class="t mf0 x16 he y934 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">standeth and knoweth me, that I am the Lord which exercise </div><div class="t m242 x16 he y1542 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">loving-kindness, judgment, and righteousness in the earth; for in </div><div class="t mddb x16 he y1a4f ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">these things I delight, saith the Lord.&quot; Jer. 9 : 23, 24. So God </div><div class="t m163 x16 he y1cd4 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">wants the sinner to come trusting in His power and mercy. If </div><div class="t me80 x16 he y13c6 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">he says, &quot; I am too sinful,&quot; he shows a disposition that would </div><div class="t m1f3 x16 he y1e6b ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">glory in self. He would come if he had something to boast of. </div><div class="t m87c x71 he y1116 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">But God delights in mercy, and mercy is unmerited favor. </div><div class="t mb7 x5d he y13c8 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">4. </div><div class="t me81 x36 he y13c8 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">WHEN the leper said, &quot; Lord, if thou </div><div class="t mf6b xbc h2c y15e8 ff6 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">wilt, </div><div class="t m2a0 x9 he y13c8 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">thou canst make </div><div class="t m6a9 x71 he y111a ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">me clean,&quot; Jesus promptly responded, &quot; I will.&quot; The willing-</div><div class="t me65 x71 he y111e ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ness of Jesus to relieve distress is the marked feature in his </div><div class="t m6fe x71 he y1eb3 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">earthly life. But in this he was simply revealing to men the </div><div class="t m9cc x71 he y19c2 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">character of God in heaven.

He delights in </div><div class="t m591 x71 he yeb4 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">mercy. Read Micah 7 : 18, 19.

We </div><div class="t m83b x71 he y14fd ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">may not always know as surely as the leper did that it is the will </div><div class="t m242 x71 he y142e ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of God to heal us at once from bodily infirmity; but we do know </div></div><div class="pi" data-data='{"ctm":[1.000000,0.000000,0.000000,1.000000,0.000000,0.000000]}'></div></div>
