He </div><div class="t m634 x18 h27 y22fc ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">remained for 12 years, mastering the writings of Buddha. He left the </div><div class="t m1306 x18 h27 y2918 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">monastery to teach history. Then in 1983 he and his wife fled Laos for </div><div class="t m1533 x18 h27 y1f34 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Thailand. </div><div class="t m1f93 x64 h27 y200a ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">While living in a refugee camp, Sakdarak met a Christian man who </div><div class="t m1cf7 x18 h27 ye92 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">talked to him about the Bible. One day his friend read John 1:1 to him. </div><div class="t m18e2 x18 h27 y1526 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The verse startled Sakdarak. He recalled that Buddha had said that if his </div><div class="t m1bb0 x18 h27 y13d0 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">followers obeyed the Word, they would be released from sin. Sakdarak </div><div class="t m1714 x18 h27 y1f5d ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">recalled other scriptures that told of the Messiah who would come. </div><div class="t m1713 x64 h27 y153c ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">His friend gave him a Bible. As he read, he found the crucifixion </div><div class="t m18fa x18 h27 y1dbf ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">story. Sakdarak recalled that the Buddhist scriptures had stated that the </div><div class="t m1731 x18 h27 y10bb ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">coming Messiah would have marks or circles in his hands and feet. </div><div class="t m12df x64 h27 y1c64 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">After two months of careful study, the former monk was baptized. </div><div class="t me78 x18 h27 y1138 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">He began teaching the Bible to fellow refugees. He explained to them </div><div class="t me17 x18 h27 y11c2 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that the one message that runs through the teachings of Buddha is that </div><div class="t maff x18 h27 y1099 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">those who find the true Word and obey it will be saved. Sakdarak </div><div class="t m192d x18 h27 y1234 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">shared this good news with anyone who would listen. </div><div class="t m1636 x29 h27 y202e ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">But when he told his wife, Khanthaly, about his discovery, she did </div><div class="t m219f x18 h27 y10de ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">not share his joy. In fact, she took his Bible, threw it on the ground, and </div><div class="t me6 x18 h27 y152c ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">jumped on it. Within her culture this was the highest level of insult one </div><div class="t me56 x4a h27 y13be ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">could give. </div><div class="t m150c x29 h27 y14c5 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Sakdarak was crushed at his wife&apos;s response. For two weeks the </div><div class="t mb44 x4a h27 y1515 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">couple did not speak or even look at each other. A divorce seemed </div><div class="t m8d5 x4a h27 y20da ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">unavoidable. </div><div class="t m1d7f x29 h27 y10f4 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Then one day Khanthaly reluctantly went to church with Sakdarak. </div><div class="t m805 x4a h27 y133b ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">A Laotian hymn touched her heart, and the Holy Spirit opened her </div><div class="t m238d x4a h27 y1246 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">understanding.
