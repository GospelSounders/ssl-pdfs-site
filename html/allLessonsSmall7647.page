Verses 12, 13. </div><div class="t m702 x61 h4 y6f9 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">NorE.—Although in the royal palace, and queen consort of the king, </div><div class="t m13c x26 h4 ya3d ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Esther was in danger of her life as much as any of her countrymen. Haman </div><div class="t ma4a x71 h4 y1fe6 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sought the extinction of the Jewish people. Neither he nor his would have </div><div class="t m94 x71 h4 yf68 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">spared high or low. Moreover, it is a principle of life that he who would </div><div class="t m479 x71 h4 y100e ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">save himself at the expense of others in the end suffers the same or a worse </div><div class="t m4d2 x26 h4 y4fa ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">fate than those whom he deserts or condemns.

He called upon Abraham to sacrifice Isaac; on Elijah </div><div class="t m9a x71 h4 yb2 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to face Ahab and Jezebel, who had threatened his life; upon Daniel and the </div><div class="t m1bd x26 h4 y4ab ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">worthies to face the lions, and the fiery furnace. He has definitely instructed </div><div class="t m30a x26 h4 y1938 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">men at times of their impending experiences, some of which would lead to </div><div class="t m74f x26 h4 y890 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">death. For instance, the prophet Agabus foretold in figure to the apostle Paul </div><div class="t m80c x26 h4 y613 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">his subsequent binding, his sufferings, and death. But if the called of God </div><div class="t m206 x26 h4 y3d4 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">fails to respond, every ultimate blessing will be lost, and another will take </div><div class="t m1068 x26 h4 y8b9 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">his place. Better to suffer affliction with the people of God for a season than to </div><div class="t m2b0 x26 h4 y667 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">rule in the courts of Egypt.
