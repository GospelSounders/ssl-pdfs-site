H. Zachary </div><div class="t m946 x4e h27 y2be9 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Roberto Azucena of Leyte, Philippines, longed for a personal </div><div class="t m9fd x48 h27 y2a8b ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">experience with God and a deeper knowledge of the Bible. But the </div><div class="t m872 x48 h27 y210a ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">church to which he belonged left him feeling uncomfortable and </div><div class="t m3ef x48 h27 y23fd ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">unfulfilled. Then two Adventist laymen offered to hold Bible </div><div class="t m467 x48 h27 y2309 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">studies in Roberto&apos;s home. Roberto realized that these two men </div><div class="t m572 x48 h27 y736 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">based their faith on the Bible alone. The more he learned about </div><div class="t m76c x48 h27 yb74 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">God, the more excited he became. When he discovered the Sab-</div><div class="t me94 x48 h27 y2028 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">bath, he closed his bakery on Sabbaths, in spite of his wife&apos;s </div><div class="t m4c3 x48 h27 y776 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">protests. She wanted nothing to do with this new religion. When </div><div class="t m80a x48 h27 ydad ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Roberto decided to be baptized, she threatened to take the children </div><div class="t m14a1 x48 h27 ycaa ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and go to live with her parents. </div><div class="t m192c x4e h27 ybaf ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Roberto needed assurance from God that he was doing the right </div><div class="t m1d0b x48 h27 y200b ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">thing to keep the Sabbath and be baptized. He went off by himself </div><div class="t m1dc x48 h27 y200d ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to pray. For years Roberto had struggled with a strong tobacco </div><div class="t ma8f x73 h27 y740 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">habit. He knew that smoking was a sin and had tried to quit </div><div class="t m391 x48 h27 yec7 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">several times. But each attempt had ended in failure. He asked </div><div class="t m1ee x48 h27 y92b ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">God for victory over smoking as well as spiritual wisdom to make </div><div class="t m8a0 x73 h27 y958 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the right choices. As he ended his prayer, he threw away his </div><div class="t mcd x48 h27 y151c ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tobacco. </div><div class="t m324 x60 h27 y76c ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The next few days were busy ones as he worked in the bakery </div><div class="t mf34 x73 h27 y13e3 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and attended the Bible studies. Six days later Roberto realized that </div><div class="t m37 x73 h27 yd75 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">he had not smoked once in almost a week. His craving for tobacco </div><div class="t m777 x73 h27 y14e2 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was gone. He knew that his victory over tobacco was an answer to </div><div class="t mb07 x73 h27 yd25 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">prayer. He was convinced that God was guiding him in his spir-</div><div class="t m156b x73 h27 ydfb ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">itual journey as well. </div><div class="t me0d x60 h27 ydb9 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Roberto has found the close walk with God that he craved. He </div><div class="t m1105 x73 h27 yadf ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">knows that following Christ is the right decision to make, regard-</div><div class="t mcfe x73 h27 yc08 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">less of what others do. As The Quiet Hour evangelistic meetings </div><div class="t mea8 x73 h27 yf42 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">closed, Roberto invited the group of new believers to worship in </div><div class="t m136c x73 h27 ya50 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the room in his home. He prays that soon his family will join him </div><div class="t m1631 x73 h27 ycf0 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in worshiping God on the Sabbath day. </div><div class="t me6a x5f h27 y140d ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Update: Word has just been received that Roberto&apos;s wife has </div><div class="t m36d x73 h27 y12db ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">changed her mind about his new religion.
