A great work had been done there and many were </div><div class="t m1ba x11 he y2048 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">rejoicing in the gospel. The apostles, Peter and John, who had come to </div><div class="t md5 x11 he y385 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Samaria to assist Philip, the deacon, had returned to Jerusalem. This lesson </div><div class="t m165e x11 he y1446 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sets forth the marvelous way in which Philip was led to leave Samaria, and his </div><div class="t m117a x11 he yf67 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">further experience. </div><div class="t md04 x38 h22 y4a4 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The Lord Directs His Servant </div><div class="t m1048 x5d he y538 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">1. </div><div class="t m3b0 x28 he y313 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">While Philip was laboring in Samaria, how was he directed to leave </div><div class="t m2f0 x11 he y88 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that place?

The word &quot;desert&quot; does not mean that the </div><div class="t m176 x11 he y767 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">country was all sand and bare rock, but there were few or no villages in which </div><div class="t m222 x11 he y6ce ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the evangelist might preach. The command for Philip to go might have </div><div class="t m259 x27 he y205d ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">seemed unreasonable, but he &quot;arose and went.&quot; </div><div class="t m1f3 x5d he ycec ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">2. </div><div class="t m14f x36 he yf7a ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Whom did Philip find traveling the desert road?
