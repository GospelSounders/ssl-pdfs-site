Thus it came down to a matter of </div><div class="t maac x64 h2d y2cfd ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">running a calculated risk by approaching the king or of facing almost certain </div><div class="t md1b x61 h2d y2b5a ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">destruction later. Secondly, Mordecai&apos;s knowledge of history, his faith in </div><div class="t m75c x61 h2d y29ca ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">God, and his certainty of the favored status of the Jews made it impossible </div><div class="t m559 x61 h2d y29c1 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">for him to believe that God would allow them to be annihilated. He assured </div><div class="t m1f4 x61 h2d y293c ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Esther that deliverance would come in some form or other. Finally, Morde-</div><div class="t m113b x61 h2d y28af ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">cai argued on the basis of how truly phenomenal it was that a Jewess should </div><div class="t m31c x61 h2d y28d9 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">be queen at a time when Jewish needs were so great. </div><div class="t m43e x61 h6c y203f ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">THINK IT THROUGH: Mordecai&apos;s statement to Esther that &quot;if you </div><div class="t m1b2 x61 h6c y1d48 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">remain silent at this time, relief and deliverance for the Jews will arise </div><div class="t m774 x61 h6c y1b25 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">from another place&quot; (Esther 4:14, NIV) reveals his belief that a higher </div><div class="t m3f0 x61 h6c y15bb ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">power is in charge of history and that history can be overruled. But why </div><div class="t m626 x61 h6c y1bbe ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">does he not state it more clearly? Why does the book seem to go out of its </div><div class="t m729 x61 h6c y1ee8 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">way to avoid mentioning God and religion? </div><div class="t m6c5 x5f h2d y62f ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">One thing that has puzzled and disturbed readers of Esther has been the </div><div class="t m580 x61 h2d y1b28 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">book&apos;s pattern of ignoring God and the features of Old Testament religion. </div><div class="t m300 x61 h2d y1bf3 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The author mentions the king of Persia 130 times, but the King of the uni-</div><div class="t m98c x61 h2d y1bf4 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">verse not even once. Nor does he allude to the usual themes of law or cov-</div><div class="t m654 x61 h2d y1754 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">enant. The book does not speak of angels or the afterlife. Nothing is said of </div><div class="t m1f8 x61 h2d y1d13 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">such things as love, kindness, mercy, and forgiveness—concepts prominent </div><div class="t m7f3 x61 h2d y1bf6 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in the rest of the Old Testament. Perhaps most strange of all, this story of </div><div class="t m1f5 x74 h2d y1487 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">God&apos;s people in a time of danger does not even talk about prayer. The only </div><div class="t me08 x61 h2d y685 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">religious practice it does portray is that of fasting. </div><div class="t m672 x60 h2d y1d17 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Esther is not the only book in the Bible that does this. The Song of Solo-</div><div class="t m260 x61 h2d y214b ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">mon does not mention the name of God either, with the possible exception of </div><div class="t m3c0 x74 h2d y11ab ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">8:6 where the phrase &quot;vehement flame&quot; (RSV) or &quot;mighty flame&quot; (NIV) </div><div class="t m57f x74 h2d y19b7 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">could be translated &quot;a flame of Yah (Yahweh)&quot; or &quot;like the very flame of the </div><div class="t mab7 x61 h2d y1bf9 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Lord&quot; (NW footnote). From such examples, we see that God is willing to </div><div class="t m811 x74 h2d y10f0 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">allow His spokesmen at times to present His presence by implication, as </div><div class="t m8a7 x74 h2d y133a ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">well as more directly. </div><div class="t m48d x60 h2d y1e89 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The authors of Esther and the Song of Solomon had their reasons for </div><div class="t m149a x74 h2d y1fb3 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">presenting their inspired material as they did. We must not judge Scripture </div><div class="t m67b x74 h2d y18cd ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">by our own ideas of how God&apos;s penmen should have written. </div><div class="t m113b x74 h6c y1d58 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ILLUMINATION: </div><div class="t me55 x82 h2d y1bfe ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;The Lord gave His word in just the way He wanted it </div><div class="t m668 x74 h2d y1f6d ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to come.

The thoughts expressed have not a set uniformity, as if cast in </div><div class="t m792 x74 h2d y2161 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">an iron mold, making the very hearing monotonous.
