The young people from my church helped me contact </div><div class="t mac0 x16 h27 y223f ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the people and invite them to the meetings. </div><div class="t m148 x73 h27 y2300 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Not far from the meeting place stood the home of a single </div><div class="t mf45 x16 h27 y2055 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">mother named Gigi. She supports her seven children by working in </div><div class="t m294 x16 h27 y920 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the nearby fields, carrying heavy bunches of bananas and loads of </div><div class="t md28 x16 h27 y20c1 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">pineapple to market. This was back-breaking work for Gigi, but </div><div class="t mb35 x16 h27 y10a7 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">she could not let her children go hungry. </div><div class="t m57d x74 h27 y2d5 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">For several days Gigi and her children had been kept awake at </div><div class="t m1d7 x71 h27 ycc0 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">night by strange noises. From midnight until sunrise it sounded as </div><div class="t m1196 x71 h27 ye61 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">if someone were throwing rocks onto her tin roof. In the morning </div><div class="t mefc x71 h27 ye45 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the family was too tired to go to work or school. </div><div class="t me1a x74 h27 y160f ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Desperate for some rest, Gigi consulted a local medium. The </div><div class="t m322 x71 h27 y1c18 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">man told her that her former husband had cast a spell on her home. </div><div class="t m8d8 x71 h27 y15f9 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The man gave Gigi some bottles filled with liquid and told her to </div><div class="t mca x71 h27 y103a ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sprinkle the liquid in and around her house. He also told her to </div><div class="t mced x71 h27 ydf7 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">write the names Melkior, Gaspar, and Balthazar above each door </div><div class="t m5c2 x71 h27 ya2d ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and window. </div><div class="t m165e x74 h27 ybd3 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Gigi did as the medium had instructed her, but the night was as </div><div class="t m1181 x71 h27 y1179 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">noisy as ever. She returned to the medium and complained that his </div><div class="t mea3 x71 h27 yb7c ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;cure&quot; had not worked. Several times she visited him, hoping that </div><div class="t mc37 x71 h27 y20c2 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">he could cast out the demons who were making her life unbearable, </div><div class="t m1062 x71 h27 yadb ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">but nothing helped. In the end, Gigi had spent every cent she had </div><div class="t m309 x71 h27 y101b ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">for nothing. </div><div class="t m1476 x74 h27 y15fb ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">About this time Gigi received an invitation to the evangelistic </div><div class="t m906 x71 h27 y961 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">meetings. She and her children attended the meetings, hoping to </div><div class="t m64b x71 h27 y770 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">find a measure of peace from the demonic noises in the night. The </div><div class="t m1f7 x71 h27 ya17 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">family listened to the messages. Soon they began to believe. Gigi </div><div class="t m107e x71 h27 yd7d ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">had come to find physical rest and peace, but she found rest in </div><div class="t m1bcb x71 h27 y147c ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Jesus and peace of heart. She learned to worship and pray and trust </div><div class="t med x26 h27 y750 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in the power of Jesus Christ over the spirits. </div><div class="t m37c x61 h27 yd9d ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Following the meetings Gigi and five of her children were </div><div class="t mee x71 h27 ycde ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">baptized.

One of </div><div class="t macf x26 h27 yb88 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">her daughters teaches Sabbath School, and another sings in choir </div><div class="t m158b x26 h27 y674 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and leads children&apos;s Sabbath School.
