Both of my parents are </div><div class="t m10f8 x11 h27 y2bd9 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">teachers; my father teaches music, my mother teaches reading. Music </div><div class="t m2817 x11 h27 y23f4 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was a part of our family, but I didn&apos;t start singing publicly until I was </div><div class="t m112e x11 h27 y28b6 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">a senior in high school. Music became more and more of a joy to me, </div><div class="t mdbc x11 h27 y2189 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and I eventually decided to study opera. </div><div class="t m2191 x5d h27 y1fb8 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">While singing at a music festival, I met Julie Karpenko, a member </div><div class="t m7f1 x11 h27 y975 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of the chorus. As we talked, I noticed she was deeply spiritual. We </div><div class="t m35e x11 h27 yca6 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">spent many hours sharing our mutual interest of music and becoming </div><div class="t m176c x11 h27 yf1e ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">friends. I learned that she was a Seventh-day Adventist. I had heard </div><div class="t me49 x11 h27 yd91 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of Adventists, but did not know much of what they believe. </div><div class="t m1767 x5d h27 y154e ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I was convinced that I was following God&apos;s truths, but how could </div><div class="t me05 x11 h27 ye44 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">we both be right and believe so differently? As I studied my Bible </div><div class="t maf9 x11 h27 y766 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and listened to some super sermons, I kept hearing some things that </div><div class="t mf32 x11 h27 y927 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">did not square with my beliefs. I searched my Bible to verify my </div><div class="t m644 x11 h27 yd1c ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">beliefs and was shocked to discover that the Bible upheld Adventist </div><div class="t m3a6 x11 h27 y83b ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">teachings, especially regarding the Sabbath and prophecy. </div><div class="t m8b5 x5d h27 ya8c ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Then Julie told me about satellite evangelistic meetings in my </div><div class="t m448 x11 h27 yf2a ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">area. I found a church that was presenting the programs and attended </div><div class="t m1858 x11 h27 y744 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">nearly every meeting. I found answers to several big questions. I saw </div><div class="t m9fd x11 h27 y106b ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that there is no reasonable explanation for Sunday worship, but the </div><div class="t m400 x11 h27 y92f ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Bible contains ample support for the Sabbath. I realized that the </div><div class="t mceb x11 h27 y120c ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Adventist church has a more truthful understanding of the Bible as a </div><div class="t m46d x11 h27 y809 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">whole. And as a Christian, I felt it was my privilege and duty to join </div><div class="t m1767 x17 h27 y824 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the Seventh-day Adventist Church. </div><div class="t m407 x5d h27 y1244 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Since then Julie Karpenko and I have been married. We have </div><div class="t m7e8 x17 h27 y986 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">completed our studies and enjoy singing together for God&apos;s glory. </div><div class="t m10f8 x17 h27 yf40 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">We look forward to seeing what God has in store for us in the field of </div><div class="t ma25 x17 h27 yd5f ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">music, for which we have trained. </div><div class="t m1494 x48 h27 ye7e ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Two years ago I had never heard of Seventh-day Adventists. I&apos;ve </div><div class="t md27 x9b h27 yf44 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">seen how God has led in my life, how He has </div><div class="t m431 x9b h27 yd7e ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">opened doors that I dared not dream of. He has </div><div class="t m131c x8e h27 y12d8 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">set me in new places at every turn, and these </div><div class="t m44b x8e h27 y517 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">places have always been better than I could </div><div class="t me4b x8e h27 y47c ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">have imagined. Therefore, I have stopped try-</div><div class="t m4c7 x8e h27 y100c ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ing to plan for myself or even guess where God </div><div class="t m14d5 x8e h27 y12dc ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">will take me. All I know is that the talents He </div><div class="t m1aba x8e h27 yfd7 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">has given to me I gladly give back to Him, to be </div><div class="t me8e x8e h27 y1212 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">used for His honor where ever He sees fit. </div><div class="t m222e x48 h6c y15ab ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Charles and Julie Reid live in Princeton, New Jersey.
