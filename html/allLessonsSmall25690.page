When the pastor invited the </div><div class="t m403 x3e h28 y298d ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">man to join the Bible-study group, he answered, &quot;My hands are my </div><div class="t m2ca x3e h28 y210b ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">gods.

Finally the doctor told him </div><div class="t m36d x3e h28 y62e ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">he would need surgery to cure the paralysis. </div><div class="t m581 x73 h28 y1169 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">When the man asked the pastor to visit him, the pastor hurried </div><div class="t m12d6 x3e h28 y10be ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to his hospital room.
