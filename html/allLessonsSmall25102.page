Daniel was impressed that anyone could love everyone </div><div class="t m600 x27 h28 y2034 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the same. At the end of the story, the announcer said that ADRA </div><div class="t mab7 x11 h28 y739 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was sponsored by the Seventh-day Adventist Church. Daniel was </div><div class="t m43a x11 h28 y1427 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">impressed. Here was true Christianity. </div><div class="t m5e3 x14 h28 y144c ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">One regular radio program featured interviews with leaders of </div><div class="t m6fd x11 h28 y1879 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">various churches. Most leaders attacked one another and accused </div><div class="t m905 x11 h28 ycc6 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">others of following false doctrines. But one pastor refused to </div><div class="t m15e x11 h28 y12cb ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">attack other denominations. Instead he answered the questions </div><div class="t m433 x11 h28 y97d ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">given him with verses from the Bible. Daniel recognized the </div><div class="t me47 x11 h28 y634 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">church&apos;s name: Seventh-day Adventist. </div><div class="t m581 x5d h28 y1688 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Daniel was not inherently religious; he wasn&apos;t even convinced </div><div class="t m1359 x11 h28 y684 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that there was a God. But if there was, he felt that Adventists must </div><div class="t m402 x11 h28 y9a2 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">really know Him. After hearing an Adventist scientist defend </div><div class="t m72a x11 h28 yd73 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">creationism, Daniel decided he wanted to know more about this </div><div class="t mcdb x11 h28 y9b5 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">church. </div><div class="t mac4 x5d h28 y218b ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Daniel telephoned the local Adventist church and asked about </div><div class="t m155 x11 h28 y18fe ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">two books that had been offered on the radio.

The pastor invited him to attend church the next </div><div class="t m669 x11 h28 y12d4 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Sabbath, and Daniel agreed. He found that the people loved one </div><div class="t m2ff x11 h28 y120e ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">another regardless of their race. He was baptized in April 1996. </div><div class="t me4a x5d h28 y1ce4 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Daniel was not looking for God, but God found him. He did not </div><div class="t m78e x17 h28 y1e18 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">know that the emptiness in his life was a hunger for God. Before he </div><div class="t m147 x31 h28 y236 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">met Adventists, he had not seen anything in </div><div class="t m562 x31 h28 y3ab ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">religion that interested him.
