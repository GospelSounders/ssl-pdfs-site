When she learned about Jesus Christ, she wanted </div><div class="t m1dfe x4a h27 y2ca9 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to follow Him. In doing so, she led her mother to Christ as well. </div><div class="t m572 x29 h27 y2880 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Shortly after Communism fell in Lithuania, Eglute&apos;s mother </div><div class="t m11d x14 h27 y23c2 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">heard about some Bible lectures and decided to go. Eglute wanted </div><div class="t m9e4 x14 h27 y2386 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to go, too, but she was just seven years old then, and her mother </div><div class="t m522 x14 h27 yb26 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">wondered if she could sit still through the meetings. </div><div class="t m677 x36 h27 y16a9 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">As they entered the lecture hall, Eglute&apos;s mother noticed that no </div><div class="t m13d x14 h27 ydc2 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">other children were present. She worried that Eglute would be </div><div class="t m35f x14 h27 y1b1 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">bored, but the little girl was fascinated with the slides of the </div><div class="t m7ec x14 h27 y18a3 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ancient city of Petra and listened carefully to the lecture. After the </div><div class="t m8d8 x14 h27 y1ebe ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">meeting a lady invited Eglute to the special children&apos;s meetings, </div><div class="t ma28 x14 h27 y1706 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">but Eglute wanted to attend the adult meetings. </div><div class="t md7 x36 h27 y16f7 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Eglute attended all the lectures with her mother. She heard the </div><div class="t m992 x14 h27 y16ae ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">speaker explain the importance of following Christ. When he </div><div class="t mdbb x14 h27 y173a ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">asked who wanted to follow Jesus, Eglute raised her hand.

When Mother told her that seven years old </div><div class="t m117a x14 h27 yc22 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">is too young to be baptized, Eglute began to cry. Mother tried to </div><div class="t m4cc x14 h27 y16e4 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">console her, but Eglute could not be persuaded to wait. </div><div class="t m131f x28 h27 y1a6f ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Eglute&apos;s mother talked to the pastor about her child&apos;s wish to be </div><div class="t m8a7 x14 h27 y18fe ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">baptized. He agreed that probably she was a little young, but he </div><div class="t m469 x14 h27 y1da0 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">asked Mother, &quot;Have you considered baptism?&quot; Eglute&apos;s mother </div><div class="t m777 x14 h27 y68b ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">shook her head; she had not seriously considered it. </div><div class="t m21d7 x28 h27 y1d6e ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Later at home, Eglute began to talk to her mother about follow-</div><div class="t mb3b x5d h27 yb45 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ing Jesus. &quot;You really should do what Jesus says,&quot; Eglute would </div><div class="t m4f x5d h27 y658 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">urge her mother.
