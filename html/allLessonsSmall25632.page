But I find ways to spread </div><div class="t mcfe x3e h27 y2b30 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the news of God&apos;s love to people who have never heard it before. </div><div class="t m1181 x16 h27 y299c ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Many people in China are eager to know about God. </div><div class="t m583 x48 h27 y2b65 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">One of my teachers, Mr. Lu, began asking me questions about </div><div class="t m136b x3e h27 y23fa ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the Bible. I answered with caution, because I did not know if he </div><div class="t m5c9 x3e h27 y223f ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was a secret spy. But he was sincere, and soon we began studying </div><div class="t mad2 x16 h27 y21d7 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the Bible behind tightly closed doors. Mr. Lu and his wife ac-</div><div class="t m1631 x3e h27 y1f11 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">cepted Jesus as their Lord. Now he is eager to tell others about the </div><div class="t m260 x16 h27 y1f0b ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">freedom found in Christ. Often he comes to ask for Bibles to give </div><div class="t m5c9 x16 h27 y20d3 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to someone he has told about Christ. </div><div class="t m1d0b x73 h27 y1fba ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">But he must be careful. A few years ago Mr. Lu was accused of </div><div class="t mf36 x16 h27 y1c9a ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">criticizing the government. He was questioned by the university, </div><div class="t mb35 x16 h27 y1503 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and his salary was reduced. He knows he is being watched. </div><div class="t m6e0 x73 h27 y1383 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Mr. Lu&apos;s brother and his family, who live in another province, </div><div class="t m632 x16 h27 ye45 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">became Christians three years ago, but they cannot fellowship with </div><div class="t m517 x16 h27 y1d98 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">other Christians in the area. It is too dangerous. They have never </div><div class="t m1669 x16 h27 y1369 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">seen a Bible! The government is very strict there, and the family&apos;s </div><div class="t m3f x16 h27 y113a ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">home has been searched twice for religious materials. Parcels </div><div class="t mb07 x16 h27 ye9e ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">arriving from outside the area are searched, and even passengers </div><div class="t m1234 x16 h27 y1089 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">arriving from other areas are spot-searched for religious materials. </div><div class="t m1a11 x71 h27 y1f38 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">In spite of this danger, Mr. Lu plans to carry Bibles and literature </div><div class="t ma24 x16 h27 y141b ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to his brother&apos;s family when he visits. Because he was born there, </div><div class="t m64b x71 h27 y12f9 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">he hopes that authorities will not search him. Pray for him! </div><div class="t m134e x74 h27 y109d ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I tutor 13 students on a private basis and study the Bible with </div><div class="t mda9 x71 h27 y10eb ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">several others. Two students from inner Mongolia recently gave </div><div class="t m225 x71 h27 yc7c ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">their hearts to the Lord. It is precious to see these intelligent, </div><div class="t m116a x71 h27 y1657 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">earnest young people choose to follow God so wholeheartedly! </div><div class="t m18c3 x74 h27 y1bfc ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Recently I spent my school holiday visiting former students. I </div><div class="t m322 x71 h27 y1143 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">stayed in the home of Chin Le. Her family are new Christians, and </div><div class="t m113a x71 h27 y1fa9 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">already they have won a number of others to God. These new believ-</div><div class="t m392 x71 h27 y1104 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ers came to Chin Le&apos;s home to study the Bible and find answers to </div><div class="t mebe x71 h27 y1d9d ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">their questions. If it were discovered that a foreigner was teaching </div><div class="t m1678 x71 h27 y14da ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">them, the believers would face great hardships. So I hid in the house </div><div class="t m1643 x71 h27 y1544 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and did not even peek out the door for a whole week! </div><div class="t me11 x74 h27 y1556 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">These people have so much love for the Lord! Many were mem-</div><div class="t m997 x71 h27 ye6a ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">bers of a Sunday church whom Chin Le told about the Sabbath. Since </div><div class="t m192c x71 h27 y1193 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the group was formed four years ago, they have established at least </div><div class="t m1bb7 x71 h27 y1f96 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sixteen other congregations with more than two thousand worship-</div><div class="t m3f1 x71 h27 y1e28 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ersâ€”all without a pastor.
