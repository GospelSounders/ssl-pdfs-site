We </div><div class="t mc6 x4a h28 y29f4 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">lived in treehouses for protection against enemies. </div><div class="t me4c x29 h28 y28de ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">When a logging company came to harvest timber, it established a </div><div class="t m1761 x18 h28 y2400 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">school for the loggers&apos; children. I learned of the school and begged my </div><div class="t mefc x4a h28 y21d8 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">parents to let me enroll so I could learn to read. My parents permitted </div><div class="t m463 x4a h28 y2007 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">me to study at the school until it closed two years later. </div><div class="t m2d2 x29 h28 y1435 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">There was no other school in the region, but I had tasted the </div><div class="t mab8 x4a h28 y15cb ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sweetness of knowledge, and I wanted to learn more. So when I was 9 </div><div class="t mcc6 x4a h28 y13d2 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">years old I set out to find a school without telling my parents. I walked </div><div class="t m6f x4a h28 y1482 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">through the mountain forests, staying away from the trails where I </div><div class="t m254 x4a h28 y1415 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">might meet someone from an enemy tribe. At night I slept in trees. </div><div class="t m46 x4a h28 y1551 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Finally I arrived in Butuan City. I found a school and asked a teacher if </div><div class="t m175a x4a h28 y1098 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I could study there. When the teacher realized that I was a Manobo and </div><div class="t mcd8 x4a h28 y12ba ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">how determined I was to attend school, she let me stay in her home and </div><div class="t m685 x4a h28 y83a ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">work to pay my tuition. </div><div class="t m1656 x29 h28 y1ed2 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">During high school I met a colporteur who introduced me to Jesus </div><div class="t m623 x4a h28 y1dc2 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Christ. I began selling literature to pay my school fees. I eventually </div><div class="t mcc x4a h28 y143b ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">completed a master&apos;s degree in public health. As the only Manobo in </div><div class="t m30f x4a h28 y1f71 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the Philippines with an MPH, I could have any job I wanted, but I was </div><div class="t m466 x4a h28 y1454 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">determined to return to the mountains and teach my own people. </div><div class="t m162c x29 h28 y1c66 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I arrived home and found my tribal land unoccupied. I knew that if </div><div class="t m383 x4a h28 y1339 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I did not claim the land, it would go to someone else. I built a simple </div><div class="t m15b8 x4a h28 y746 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">school, and soon some 60 students enrolled. I needed help; I wrote to </div><div class="t mcbc x4a h28 y117c ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Mountain View College and asked for a student missionary to come </div><div class="t m166f x4a h28 yf39 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and teach. </div><div class="t m1754 x29 h28 y138c ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Jessica Hermoso volunteered. She made her way alone into the </div><div class="t m114c x14 h28 y195f ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">mountains and found the little mission school. She is a natural teacher, </div><div class="t me76 x14 h28 y1d75 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and the children love her. But then rebel soldiers invaded the area, and </div><div class="t m5b9 x14 h28 y1cbb ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">it became too dangerous for Jessica or the students to remain. She </div><div class="t m1656 x14 h28 y1604 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">returned to her home, and I remained to farm my family&apos;s land. </div><div class="t me6f x36 h28 y1fd3 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">In 1997 I met Jessica again, and eventually we were married. When </div><div class="t m24f x14 h28 y20a8 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">it was safe to return, we reopened the school. We have added a second </div><div class="t m82d x14 h28 y118f ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">school in a nearby village, and we are erecting more permanent </div><div class="t m5d1 x14 h28 ye13 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">buildings as funds become available. Other villages have asked us to </div><div class="t m1a29 x14 h28 y152e ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">teach their children, but we have no money to hire teachers. My dream </div><div class="t mf34 x14 h28 y1d0d ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">for an education refused to die. In fact, it has grown far beyond what I </div><div class="t m8a x14 h28 y1507 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ever could have imagined. </div><div class="t m1488 x28 h1 y1d77 ff1 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Danilo and Jessica Bada work with the Manobo people in the southern </div><div class="t m559 x14 h1 y14d1 ff1 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Philippines. </div><div class="t m19f2 x36 h28 y13b6 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Produced by the General Conference Office of Mission Awarenes </div><div class="t mec6 x7c h28 y1d41 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">E-mail: gomission(if,/c.adventistorg </div><div class="t m1642 x1b4 h28 y241a ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">103 </div></div><div class="pi" data-data='{"ctm":[1.000000,0.000000,0.000000,1.000000,0.000000,0.000000]}'></div></div>
