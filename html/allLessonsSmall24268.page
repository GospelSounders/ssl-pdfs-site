She fell in love with God and </div><div class="t mea4 x36 h22 yb77 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">accepted Jesus as her Saviour. She accepted the Bible truths we </div><div class="t m162c x36 h22 y10cc ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">presented and joined our small group worshiping on Sabbath. </div><div class="t m664 x63 h22 yac4 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">After studying several months, Amy decided to be baptized. </div><div class="t m1754 x36 h22 y1d2 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">But she worried about the ancestors&apos; niche in her living room. </div><div class="t m1c9 x36 h22 y264 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Before she came to our church, she and her husband had wor-</div><div class="t md7 x36 h22 y721 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">shiped at the niche every day.
