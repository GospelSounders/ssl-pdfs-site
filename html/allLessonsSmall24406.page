He talked loudly, and was slow to catch on. </div><div class="t m1139 x71 h22 y2b43 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Poor, simple, and dirty, he smoked, and often was seen staggering </div><div class="t m468 x71 h22 y29c2 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">drunk down the streets. No one thought he would ever amount to </div><div class="t m309 x71 h22 y2880 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">anything. When he first came to our church, our members tried to </div><div class="t m692 x71 h22 y238a ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">accept him, but he was so different. </div><div class="t m145e x61 h22 y231d ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Fatherless and poor, he was raised by a simple-minded mother </div><div class="t mb1e x71 h22 y2038 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in a two-room house with no bathroom. An Adventist neighbor </div><div class="t m45f x71 h22 y16a9 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">visited them and encouraged Olek to read the Bible. When Olek </div><div class="t m74f x71 h22 ydc2 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">asked the local priest questions about the Sabbath, the priest </div><div class="t mf44 x71 h22 y3fb ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">became angry.

He began </div><div class="t m1da x71 h22 y2175 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">using a bathtub, and soon smelled better. As he read the Bible, he </div><div class="t mea3 x71 h22 y621 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">made other changes in his life. He began to wear the clean clothes </div><div class="t m1645 x26 h22 yd7 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">we gave him, and washed his hair more often. He became quieter, </div><div class="t m275 x26 h22 y8ff ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and more reasonable. He quit drinking coffee, eating unclean meats, </div><div class="t m685 x26 h22 y741 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and finally, after a difficult struggle, he gave up his beloved beer. </div><div class="t m1d0b x61 h22 y1fa0 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">He began preaching the gospel to anyone who would listen. One </div><div class="t m632 x26 h22 y1f58 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">day he saw a priest sitting on a bench reading a book. Olek thought </div><div class="t m116b x26 h22 y18a6 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the priest was reading the Bible. He greeted him and said, &quot;I see </div><div class="t m8d2 x26 h22 y8b8 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">you are interested in the Bible.&quot; The priest said &quot;Yes I am, but let&apos;s </div><div class="t m10ff x26 h22 y822 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">not talk about it here; come to my house.&quot; </div><div class="t mcbc x61 h22 ycd7 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Although Poland is a &quot;Christian&quot; country, people who dare to </div><div class="t m1639 x26 h22 y152d ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">change religions meet with opposition.
