He started reading the Bible and, after a difficult begin-</div><div class="t m665 x18 h27 y23b0 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ning, he found comfort from his reading. As he continued reading the </div><div class="t mdbc x18 h27 y874 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Bible, he felt a strong need to know God better. </div><div class="t m1085 x64 h27 y12c1 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">He saw a notice for a Revelation Seminar and decided to attend. </div><div class="t m104 x18 h27 y396 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">During the seminar he accepted Jesus as his Saviour.

But they </div><div class="t me2c x4a h27 y154 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">kept praying and visiting.

They continued visitation, and contacted more than 900 </div><div class="t me07 x4a h27 y1d8 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">persons. Slowly friendships developed, and God opened the way for </div><div class="t m8e4 x4a h27 y1a20 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Bible studies.
