During my free time I </div><div class="t md14 x71 h28 y2aa5 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">enjoyed going to game parlors, where I could watch TV, play </div><div class="t m946 xcb h2c y2aa5 ff6 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">mah </div><div class="t m9fa x16 h2c y29d1 ff6 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">long </div><div class="t m64d x4e h28 y29d1 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">or poker, and listen to music. At first I enjoyed the music and </div><div class="t m722 x71 h28 y212a ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">relaxed with the rhythm. But gradually the music and atmosphere </div><div class="t m310 x71 h28 y211f ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of these places began to depress me. It seemed that a voice told me, </div><div class="t m43e x71 h28 y201a ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Leave this place and never return!&quot; </div><div class="t m5d8 x74 h28 y735 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I studied electronics and opened a home appliance repair shop. </div><div class="t m7b7 x71 h28 yb74 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">But I still played poker with my friends. I did not realize it, but I </div><div class="t mbb2 x71 h28 ycfc ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was addicted to gambling. I struggled with jealousy and hatred too. </div><div class="t m40b x71 h28 y125f ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">And once, because of my gambling habit, I was even jailed. When I </div><div class="t md0c x71 h28 ydac ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">got out of jail, my old friends laughed at me. But they still wanted </div><div class="t md14 x71 h28 ycaa ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">me to gamble with them. </div><div class="t m6b3 x74 h28 y837 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I began to think seriously about life and realized how many </div><div class="t m8df x71 h28 y200b ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">people in modern China are seeking after money. More and more </div><div class="t m7e6 x71 h28 y1261 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">people have become self-centered and jealous. Principles of truth </div><div class="t m2ea x71 h28 y740 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and right living have become blurred in people&apos;s minds as they </div><div class="t m2fb x71 h28 yec7 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">have become slaves to money! </div><div class="t m1308 x61 h28 y92b ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I knew what was right and wrong, and I decided to listen to my </div><div class="t mbb7 x71 h28 y7f1 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">conscience and follow its leading. But my good intentions left me </div><div class="t m664 x71 h28 y151c ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">friendless and lonely. Then I remembered a gospel radio program I </div><div class="t m1754 x71 h28 y76c ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">had heard on shortwave radio. </div><div class="t m658 x61 h28 y13e3 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I found the program on the dial and began listening. Hope </div><div class="t m77a x26 h28 yd75 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">returned to my heart. Since October [1996] I have been listening to </div><div class="t m9ff x71 h28 y14e2 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the Voice of Hope radio from Hong Kong. </div><div class="t mc8 x61 h28 yd25 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Ever since I began listening to these Christian programs my </div><div class="t m257 x71 h28 y103b ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">spiritual life has taken shape and is growing. I am thrilled about the </div><div class="t mdc9 x26 h28 ydb9 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">privilege of knowing the Lord. Now I have hope and meaning in </div><div class="t m289 x26 h28 yadf ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">my life. I would like to give thanks to Jesus first, but also to the </div><div class="t m3bd x26 h28 yc08 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">radio speakers and all of you who have made those wonderful </div><div class="t m87a x26 h28 yf42 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">programs that proclaim the good news. </div><div class="t m40b x61 h28 ya50 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I believe in God; I am seeking truth; I am thirsty for truth. I want </div><div class="t m9b x26 h28 ycf0 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to be baptized and cleansed by the Holy Spirit so that I can grow </div><div class="t m5e1 x26 h28 y102f ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">strong in the Lord. With God&apos;s mighty power I believe I can be a </div><div class="t m7a5 x26 h28 y101c ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">strength to others in chasing away evil. I yearn to help people to </div><div class="t m167a x26 h28 y12db ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">walk in the path that leads to life eternal. </div><div class="t m1d77 x64 h22 yd9f ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Zeng Qing Peng lives in China.
