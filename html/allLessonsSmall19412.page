The professor in charge stepped </div><div class="t m1e9 x48 h28 y2b1b ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">into the hallway for a few minutes. When he returned he said: &quot;The li-</div><div class="t m687 x48 h28 y2936 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">brarian is here. Apparently someone took the </div><div class="t m45b x4c h2c y2936 ff6 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">S.D.A. Bible Commentary </div><div class="t m14da x48 h28 y237f ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">volume on Isaiah out of the library last night. Students looking for it this </div><div class="t m98f x48 h28 y1491 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">morning to study for this exam could not find it. Would the culprit stand </div><div class="t m9a1 x48 h28 y2d2 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">up, go get the book, and return it to the library?&quot; The heart of a young </div><div class="t mb42 x48 h28 y397 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">minister-to-be began to race as he realized he had made a terrible mis-</div><div class="t m55c x48 h28 y1203 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">take. He had been getting an &quot;A&quot; in the class and did not want to lose it </div><div class="t m7f0 x48 h28 y15d9 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">on the final exam. The night before he had come to the conclusion that </div><div class="t m134 x48 h28 y3c9 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">without several hours&apos; more work with the commentary he probably </div><div class="t m93f x48 h28 ya2a ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">would lose his &quot;A.&quot; The commentaries that were allowed to be taken out </div><div class="t mb35 x48 h28 ya0e ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of the library were gone; only those to be used in the library remained. </div><div class="t md27 x28 h28 y1699 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">But the library was closing. He thought it would be all right to take the </div><div class="t m443 x73 h28 y4a7 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">volume he was using home and return it the moment the library door </div><div class="t meda x48 h28 y9b2 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">opened the next morning. No one even would suspect it had been taken. </div><div class="t maac x73 h28 y13b7 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">He went to bed about 2:00 a.m., setting the clock for 6:45. But somehow </div><div class="t m64c x48 h28 y1269 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the alarm did not go off when planned and he woke up at 8:30. The exam </div><div class="t m1f5 x73 h28 y583 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was at nine. &quot;Too late now,&quot; he said to himself as he dressed. &quot;I&apos;ll have </div><div class="t m469 x73 h28 ydf7 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to put that book back later and hope no one notices.&quot; </div><div class="t ma8 x28 h28 y541 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Sitting in the classroom, he could feel his face flushing. No one sus-</div><div class="t m393 x73 h28 y156e ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">pected him. He was a senior theology major and a student leader in reli-</div><div class="t m8b5 x73 h28 y249 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">gious activities. He noticed that those in the classroom had stopped writ-</div><div class="t mea4 x73 h28 y6d1 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ing their exams. They were waiting to see if anyone would stand up. He </div><div class="t mf62 x73 h28 y8ba ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">stumbled to his feet and left the room as quickly as possible. Some of his </div><div class="t m2fa x73 h28 yb16 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">friends gasped in surprise. He never had been more humiliated. </div><div class="t m76e x28 h28 y498 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">That afternoon the young man learned that both the librarian and the </div><div class="t m83b x73 h28 y782 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">professor were jolted to think that he was the guilty party. That made </div><div class="t m404 x73 h28 y8d8 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">going to them for forgiveness even harder. First, he visited the librarian, </div><div class="t m4d2 x73 h28 y1448 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">who expressed his disappointment and then told him that he hoped the </div><div class="t m645 x73 h28 y770 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">young man had learned something. Next, he visited the chairman of the </div><div class="t m642 x73 h28 y8c2 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">religion department, the teacher of the class. They talked for over an </div><div class="t m401 x73 h28 yf80 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">hour. The professor was patient and understanding. The theology student </div><div class="t m1d7 x73 h28 yc3 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">felt forgiven but, of course, could not undo what had happened. </div><div class="t m370 x4e h28 y72b ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Ours is a world of sin and brokenness, of minor offenses as well as </div><div class="t m31c x74 h28 yfeb ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">major holocausts. If there is no forgiveness for what we have done and </div><div class="t me08 x74 h28 y1750 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">still do, there is no hope. Christ came to reveal the power of divine for-</div><div class="t mcd x73 h28 y37f ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">giveness to usâ€”to teach us how to be forgiven, and to forgive. </div><div class="t m386 x4e h28 y810 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Beyond Christ&apos;s forgiveness God has provided a means of reclaiming </div><div class="t mae4 x74 h28 y869 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">us from sin. God&apos;s love did not stop at Calvary. Because of what was </div><div class="t mb5a x74 h28 y5f1 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">accomplished there, He reaches beyond to transform the hearts and lives </div><div class="t m76b x74 h28 y7a0 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of the truly penitent and to enable them to follow Him along the pathway </div><div class="t m98f x74 h28 yaff ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of obedience. </div><div class="t m1a0e x1d3 h22 yac0 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">5 </div></div><div class="pi" data-data='{"ctm":[1.000000,0.000000,0.000000,1.000000,0.000000,0.000000]}'></div></div>
