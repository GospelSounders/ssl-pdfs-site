In </div><div class="t m769 xe h35 y1e80 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">1877 it was a rather isolated communion in North America. Now it is an international </div><div class="t mea xe h35 y171e ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">church, planted in over 90 percent of all the countries of the world. The church began </div><div class="t m82d xe h35 y1f46 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">poor and without organization. This denomination today operates thousands of </div><div class="t m7b7 xe h35 y1c3f ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">institutions. It is respected for having one of the finest missionary structures and </div><div class="t m18c3 xe h35 y1847 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">most effective organizations in the world. Yet these very developments, especially of </div><div class="t m1289 xe h35 y1a32 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">recent years, pose a number of problems which challenge us to consider the ques-</div><div class="t mad2 xe h35 y1765 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tion: What does it mean to be the church of God today? </div><div class="t m57c x3e h35 y10a5 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The quest for national and cultural identity in many areas threatens the unity of our </div><div class="t m45c xe h35 y1739 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">church formation. This raises the question: What is the biblical basis and form of </div><div class="t m3e0 xe h35 y177e ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">church unity? In a few areas the Seventh-day Adventist Church has become the </div><div class="t m82e x92 h35 y1894 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">largest single Protestant denomination, which gives it considerable prestige and </div><div class="t m8a xe h35 y681 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">social power. In some countries Seventh-day Adventists do not identify themselves as </div><div class="t mb5a xe h35 y124 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">a church. They speak of themselves as a communion or a fellowship of Seventh-day </div><div class="t m749 xe h35 y18b6 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Adventists. To these believers the very word &quot;church&quot; stands for social control, </div><div class="t mb91 x92 h35 yb30 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">clerical power, falsehood, oppression, Babylon, and anti-Christ. A new look at the </div><div class="t m411 x92 h35 y1b20 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">biblical meaning of &quot;church&quot; may help to settle this issue. </div><div class="t ma2 x3e h35 y22ac ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Another series of questions arises concerning the church&apos;s relationship to the </div><div class="t mca x92 h35 y417 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">state, and to the world in general.

Traditional patterns of authority </div><div class="t m7c4 x92 h35 y1932 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and control have been challenged; questions are raised concerning the role of </div><div class="t m1154 x15 h35 y1759 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">women in the church and their ordination to the ministry; lay movements are urging </div><div class="t m642 x92 h35 y161c ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">new forms of lay participation in the administration of the church, etc. </div><div class="t m1138 x16 h35 yfa5 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Finally, the radically changed missionary situation demands that we take an honest </div><div class="t m593 x15 h35 y236 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">look at ourselves and determine our priorities according to the biblical concepts. </div><div class="t me73 x15 h35 y16d5 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Two billion people have never heard with clarity the gospel of Jesus Christ.
