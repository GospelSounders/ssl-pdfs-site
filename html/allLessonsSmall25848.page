When Mr. Costa discovered the Sabbath truth, he asked his </div><div class="t ma31 x11 h22 y29e1 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">pastor why Christians did not keep the Sabbath. His pastor&apos;s answer </div><div class="t ma2b x17 h22 y2428 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">did not satisfy him, so he and his family began studying the Bible &apos; </div><div class="t m1a0d x17 h22 y2318 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">together at home.

Because </div><div class="t me35 x17 h22 y1099 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">there was no Adventist church in the area, the Costas opened their </div><div class="t m135 x3e h22 ye0c ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">simple mud house for the little group to meet on Sabbath.

Others joined the branch Sabbath School, and soon they </div><div class="t md00 x3e h22 y1009 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">needed a larger place to meet. They built a chapel of mud bricks </div><div class="t me72 x3e h22 yc7e ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and palm branches. </div><div class="t m63f x73 h22 yf3e ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The group continued to grow, and the conference sent a Bible </div><div class="t m190e x3e h22 yd0e ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">worker to help the lay people establish a church there.
