She enjoys </div><div class="t me4a x16 h27 y2b9c ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">school now. But it wasn&apos;t always so. She used to attend a public </div><div class="t m1d79 x16 h27 y28a2 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">school, but competition for grades was fierce, and Hitomi began to </div><div class="t m777 x16 h27 y2091 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">show signs of stress. Her mother worried about the effect the stress </div><div class="t m27c x71 h27 y239e ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was having on Hitomi&apos;s health. She discussed her concerns with </div><div class="t m1184 x71 h27 y32d ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">her neighbor, who suggested she send Hitomi to the Okinawa </div><div class="t m1353 x71 h27 y602 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Saniku Elementary School, a Seventh-day Adventist mission school. </div><div class="t mf44 x71 h27 ya6 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Hitomi&apos;s mother was not a Christian; in fact she was an atheist. But </div><div class="t m63b x71 h27 y1ee ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">she wondered if a Christian school really could help her daughter. </div><div class="t m2c0 x74 h27 y348 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Hitomi was not sure she wanted to change schools, but right </div><div class="t m393 x71 h27 y1c9 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">away she noticed a difference. Her classmates and teachers were </div><div class="t m872 x71 h27 ya2b ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">kind and hepful to one another, not competing. In fact, when one </div><div class="t m432 x71 h27 y2d9 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">boy had difficulty with a subject, other children helped him. Hitomi </div><div class="t m1105 x71 h27 y55a ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">began to relax and enjoy her studies. </div><div class="t m1348 x74 h27 yf9 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Public schools held classes six days a week. But at the Adventist </div><div class="t m678 x71 h27 yfb ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">school, Saturday classes met at the church.

Hitomi enjoyed </div><div class="t m685 x71 h27 y247 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Sabbath School ; it was actually fun! She told her mother about it. </div><div class="t m3ba x71 h27 ycf6 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Mother decided to go. She wanted to know what her children were </div><div class="t m42c x71 h27 y9cf ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">being taught. Little by little, Hitomi&apos;s mother was led to Jesus. </div><div class="t m158b x61 h27 y43a ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">As Mother studied the Bible, she became convicted that she </div><div class="t ma00 x71 h27 y15 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">needed to make things right with her mother-in-law.

But </div><div class="t m1376 x26 h27 y218 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">now she knew she would have no peace until she asked her mother-</div><div class="t m1858 x26 h27 y5d5 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in-law&apos;s forgiveness. After months of struggle, she called her mother-</div><div class="t m309 x26 h27 y33d ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in-law and made amends.
