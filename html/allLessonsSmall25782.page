He </div><div class="t m1105 x16 h28 y2422 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">wanted to take a Bible home after the meeting, but the usher told him </div><div class="t m639 x16 h28 y2294 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that he would have to attend all the meetings before he could have the </div><div class="t m1dfe x16 h28 y1ead ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Bible. Samson tried to buy a Bible in town, but the shops were closed. </div><div class="t m7e8 x71 h28 y2038 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Finally he borrowed his neighbor&apos;s Bible. </div><div class="t m28a x74 h28 y11f4 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">That night he sat beside the fire and told his relatives what he had </div><div class="t m5d8 x71 h28 ydaa ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">heard at the meeting that day. He could remember only one Bible </div><div class="t mafc x71 h28 ycfd ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">reference that the pastor had quoted: 1 Thessalonians 4:13-18. He read </div><div class="t m574 x71 h28 ybae ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">these verses, which explain how Jesus will return to rescue those who </div><div class="t m5c2 x71 h28 y924 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">love Him to live with Him forever. </div><div class="t m450 x74 h28 y4a6 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Later that night Samson dreamed that someone came into his </div><div class="t mb7c x71 h28 y838 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">bedroom and crushed his head against the bed. When he awoke, pain </div><div class="t m1196 x71 h28 y12cb ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">shot through his head. It subsided enough so that he could attend the </div><div class="t m778 x71 h28 y1019 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">meetings, but later the pain returned with a force that made him sick. </div><div class="t m5e1 x71 h28 yedb ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">This happened every day, but the pain did not stop Samson from </div><div class="t m1717 x71 h28 yd1e ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">attending the meetings or accepting the truths he heard. The pastor </div><div class="t m7fe x71 h28 yff5 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">learned about Samson&apos;s mysterious headaches and prayed for him. </div><div class="t m208 x71 h28 yff6 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">After the meetings ended, he took Samson to Juba for a check-up. </div><div class="t m18ec x74 h28 yd73 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Samson stayed with his aunt while in Juba to see the doctor.

Samson invited them to study the Bible with him, and </div><div class="t m463 x71 h28 ydcd ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">on Saturday he took his brothers to church. But when his aunt learned </div><div class="t m7e7 x71 h28 yecb ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that Samson no longer followed the family&apos;s religion, she became </div><div class="t m98f x71 h28 y106d ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">angry and hid their Bibles. The pastor gave Samson and his brothers </div><div class="t m1e0 x71 h28 y12d4 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">three more Bibles. </div><div class="t m906 x61 h28 y120e ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Samson shared his growing faith with neighbors as well, and in-</div><div class="t m409 x71 h28 yae1 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">vited them to study the Bible with him.

Soon after Samson and his brother, </div><div class="t m42c x32 h28 y90d ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Wisely, were baptized.
