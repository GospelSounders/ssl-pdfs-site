We shall try to </div><div class="t m1498 xda h35 y4ad ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">understand better how simple faith is, and how to use it in surrender of ourselves to His </div><div class="t m8a3 xc4 h35 y439 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">control.

We shall marvel anew at the almost unbelievable promises He </div><div class="t m362 xda h35 ycef ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">makes, sense the joy of bearing His fruit in our lives as we accept Him and become </div><div class="t mf36 xda h35 y701 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">righteous by faith. </div><div class="t me0a x4 h35 y4e9 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">We have decided to concentrate our study on the writings&apos;of the apostle John—his </div><div class="t m6e0 xc4 h35 y2e5 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Gospel, his Epistles, and the Revelation. But we draw occasionally on other inspired </div><div class="t m644 xc4 h35 ya4d ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">witnesses to fill out some of the picture. We gratefully draw on the special counsel to this </div><div class="t m406 xc4 h35 ye89 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">remnant people by the spirit of prophecy. </div><div class="t mad3 xe h35 ya4f ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">It is possible that many will feel that some important principle or emphasis has been </div><div class="t med xc4 h35 y8c4 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">overlooked in this series of lessons.

Much more can be said about the ties between these steps to Christ and His </div><div class="t m176c xc4 h35 y519 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">work in the heavenly sanctuary and the closing of that work. Righteousness by faith as a </div><div class="t m354 xc4 h35 y4b8 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">special emphasis in our history is a most profitable study.
