All around him was </div><div class="t m1369 x26 h27 y2bd9 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sand. For some time he could hear the barking of dogs, the hum of activity </div><div class="t mec7 x26 h27 y213a ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in the village he had left. He was aware of human life. But soon it became </div><div class="t m143b x18 h27 y2310 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">very dark, the sounds were lost, and he found himself looking up at a vast </div><div class="t m14dc x26 h27 y2329 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sky with millions of twinkling stars. He suddenly realized how tiny he was, </div><div class="t m167b x18 h27 y2016 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">how vulnerable. Later he testified that he had felt the presence of God as </div><div class="t m172f x18 h27 y6f7 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">he had never felt it before. It is when we recognize our smallness, that we </div><div class="t mb35 x18 h27 y1cee ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">can sense God&apos;s greatness. </div><div class="t ma32 x18 h87 ybfb ff1 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">8.

Elsewhere the psalmist says that God spoke, and &quot;it was </div><div class="t m1e5 x18 h27 ye49 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">done&quot; (Ps. 33:9). Here God uses only the tips of His fingers. This is sym-</div><div class="t mb03 x18 h27 y901 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">bolic language, of course, but it emphasizes the effortlessness of God&apos;s ac-</div><div class="t m88a x18 h27 y1573 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tivity in creating what to us is gigantic.
