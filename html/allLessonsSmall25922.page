Recently I </div><div class="t m474 x11 h27 y2cca ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sat in a church filled with worshipers. But three of the church workers </div><div class="t m204d x17 h27 y2428 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">were not present; they were imprisoned for their faith. The Bibles the </div><div class="t m5c1 x17 h27 y2318 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">members so reverently held were smuggled into the country, for the </div><div class="t m1537 x17 h27 y1fc1 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">government does not permit the publishing of religious literature. </div><div class="t m2f85 x48 h27 yd36 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">In another country I visited a little house on the edge of a city. Each </div><div class="t m1a12 x17 h27 y125d ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Sabbath members secretly entered the house to worship; they sang in </div><div class="t m2046 x17 h27 y160e ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">whispers to prevent detection. Then one day police raided the house </div><div class="t m1816 x17 h27 y1000 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and arrested the pastor. He remains in prison. </div><div class="t m135 x48 h27 yd37 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">In another country I met an elderly man sitting alone in church. </div><div class="t me44 x17 h27 y1290 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">When he had refused to send his children to school on Sabbath, the </div><div class="t mcc7 x17 h27 ydf2 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">authorities took his children and sent them to a Communist boarding </div><div class="t m86e x17 h27 ydaf ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">school.

One night as she returned from the meeting, her father </div><div class="t m1637 x3e h27 y895 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">met her and tried to drag her to the barn for another whipping.

Her father gave a violent yank, and the water </div><div class="t m57b x3e h27 y74a ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">pipe broke.
