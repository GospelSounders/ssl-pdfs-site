This </div><div class="t m6a6 x4e h2d ya48 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">makes it necessary for every generation of believers, in every country </div><div class="t mca x4e h2d ydf ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and culture, to discover for themselves how to apply the biblical princi-</div><div class="t m1d4 x60 h2d yb18 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ples to their particular situation. </div><div class="t mf4d x5b h2d yfbc ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">It has become evident, further, that these biblical principles are based </div><div class="t m5b5 x4e h2d y826 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">on two premises. The first is that the whole world lies in the power of </div><div class="t mb3 x4e h2d y7b7 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sin and that everything in this world is affected by its evil influence. </div><div class="t m9d6 x4e h2d y703 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Therefore, Christians should shun this world, that is, its corruption, </div><div class="t m7fb x60 h2d y572 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">wickedness, and association with evil. The other basic premise is that </div><div class="t m200 x60 h2d y80c ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">God loves this world. Out of love He created it and endowed it with </div><div class="t m4cf x60 h2d y90b ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">riches, beauty, energies, and wonderful things for people to enjoy. Out </div><div class="t m5c8 x60 h2d y3df ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of love God is actively at work in this world (John 5:17) to save it and to </div><div class="t m84b x60 h2d y6d6 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">restore it so that it can fulfill the purpose for which it was made. </div><div class="t m2bf x5b h2d y323 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Perhaps no other biblical image describes this twofold attitude toward </div><div class="t m6da x60 h2d yaf9 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the world better than that of light. It views the world as darkness and </div><div class="t mab1 x60 h2d y79c ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the church as light.
