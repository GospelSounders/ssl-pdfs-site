H. Zachary </div><div class="t m3db x61 h28 y2c19 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The evangelism training seminar in Germany had just ended. </div><div class="t m781 x26 h28 y2a65 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">As Uwe Wiesenberg, one of the participants, drove home, he was </div><div class="t m854 x26 h28 y2462 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">eager to share his faith with someone. But this was Germany, </div><div class="t m649 x26 h28 y2331 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">where people&apos;s materialistic focus makes witnessing for Christ </div><div class="t m298 x26 h28 y2333 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">difficult. As he drove, he asked God to help him find someone </div><div class="t m1e9 x26 h28 yed8 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">who needed to know Him. </div><div class="t m43d x64 h28 y974 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">He stopped to visit his uncle Paul, a hospital nurse who also had </div><div class="t m287 x26 h28 y1547 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">attended the seminar. As Uwe stood in the hospital foyer, an old </div><div class="t m264 x26 h28 y122e ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">man walked up and began talking to him. He told Uwe that he had </div><div class="t m158b x26 h28 yfad ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">decided to end his life. </div><div class="t mea5 x64 h28 y564 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Uwe guided the man to a bench and listened as the man unbur-</div><div class="t m3a2 x26 h28 yfe1 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">dened his heart, telling a story of heartache and disappointment. </div><div class="t m4d2 x18 h28 y1098 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Uwe could understand why the man was deeply depressed. </div><div class="t m134e x64 h28 yd01 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">When the man stopped talking, Uwe shared his faith in God and </div><div class="t m75b x18 h28 yad1 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">his confidence in the power of prayer. He shared the story of Jesus </div><div class="t m43e x26 h28 y7d0 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and the love of God that led Jesus to die on the cross. &quot;God loves </div><div class="t m7f7 x18 h28 y1281 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">you very much,&quot; Uwe offered. &quot;He will forgive your sins and fill </div><div class="t m3dd x18 h28 y11ef ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">your heart with joy and peace. He will make you a new man.&quot; </div><div class="t m12a x18 h28 y890 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Then the two men prayed. </div><div class="t m9b x64 h28 yf2f ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Hope flickered in the man&apos;s eyes, and a smile crept across his </div><div class="t mc0 x18 h28 y1007 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">face. Then the man asked, &quot;May I go to church with you?&quot; </div><div class="t m5d8 x64 h28 yc7a ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">As Uwe began to explain that he does not live in Neustadt, his </div><div class="t m270 x18 h28 ya93 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">uncle Paul walked up. Uwe introduced him to the old man and </div><div class="t ma6a x18 h28 yd97 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">relayed the man&apos;s request to go to church. Paul promised to take </div><div class="t ma7e x18 h28 yee1 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">him the next Sabbath and then for a walk in the Black Forest </div><div class="t md25 x18 h28 y1236 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">where they could commune with God. Paul arranged with the man </div><div class="t m706 x18 h28 ycae ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to begin Bible studies. </div><div class="t m45f x64 h28 y988 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;I have never met such wonderful people in all my life!&quot; the old </div><div class="t m55a x18 h28 yd41 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">man smiled.

Souls can be </div><div class="t m1f2 x4a h28 ydcf ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">won to Jesus even here in Germany.&quot; </div><div class="t maac x29 h1 yf54 ff1 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">J. H.
