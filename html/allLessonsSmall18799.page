Though it is an old theme, every generation of believers must find the </div><div class="t mec2 x11 h2d y4c ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">answers to that question for itself. And each unit of believers must seek its own </div><div class="t m1c2 x17 h2d ya39 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">forms of relating to the world in the particular setting in which it is called to </div><div class="t m74e x17 h2d y99e ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">witness for Christ. </div><div class="t m50e x14 h2d y282 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The reason for this is clear. Our world is constantly changing. New chal-</div><div class="t md2e x17 h2d y2b4 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">lenges are thereby arising to the life of the church, its mission, and to the believ-</div><div class="t m67d x17 h2d y244 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ers&apos; growth in grace and in Christian maturity. Solutions from the past do not </div><div class="t m719 x17 h2d y4c2 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">always fit the way in which we live today. Moreover, our world is made of </div><div class="t m33b x17 h2d y8c ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">vastly different cultures and societies, of religions and ideologies, of political </div><div class="t mb1 x17 h2d y1d2 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and social orders, of values and patterns of thinking. That means that the </div><div class="t m3db x17 h2d y2dd ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">relationship between the Christian and the world cannot, and </div><div class="t m442 x5 h4a y2dd ff6 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">should </div><div class="t m1bd x160 h2d y2dd ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">not, take </div><div class="t m21c x17 h2d y604 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">exactly the same forms everywhere. For instance, what appears to be an ac-</div><div class="t m226 x17 h2d y417 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ceptable form of Christian behavior in one culture—say dress, music, or social </div><div class="t mb3 x3e h2d y1a0 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">patterns between male and female—may not be appropriate in another. The </div><div class="t m5a2 x17 h2d y2a3 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">same applies to the relationship of the Christian to government, the economic </div><div class="t m3dd x17 h2d yba ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">order, or social institutions. Though the varying and ever changing circum-</div><div class="t m834 x17 h2d y5e ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">stances in the world may demand different </div><div class="t ma3 x78 h4a y5e ff6 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">forms </div><div class="t ma3f x4f h2d y5e ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of relating to the world, all </div><div class="t ma61 x3e h2d y60 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">these forms must be firmly based on sound biblical principles. To discover </div><div class="t m7e6 x3e h2d y63 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the biblical principles that deal with the relationship between the Christian and </div><div class="t m1315 x3e h2d y65 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the world is the primary purpose of this series of lessons. </div><div class="t m593 x14 h2d y68 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Our Adventist pioneers lived in the expectation of the immediate coming of </div><div class="t mb27 x3e h2d y94c ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">our Lord and Saviour. Their whole life and mission had such an urgency that </div><div class="t m2a6 x3e h2d y1dc ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">they considered everything and every activity in the world which did not con-</div><div class="t m3df x3e h2d y250 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tribute directly to the advance of their cause as waste, if not actually sinful. </div><div class="t m85c x3e h2d yd6a ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">After nearly 140 years the believers have, in some places, lost much of that </div><div class="t m39a x3e h2d yfdd ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">urgency. This is greatly affecting the attitude of the Christian toward the </div><div class="t m235 x3e h2d ycf9 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">world and the things that are of this world. We realize, as Ellen White stated, </div><div class="t m57a x3e h2d yc6 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that as long as they are in the world, God&apos;s people have to do with the things of </div><div class="t m34b x3e h2d y326 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the world. (See </div><div class="t m6f1 x6c h4a y325 ff6 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Testimonies, vol. </div><div class="t m1b9 x3b h2d y294 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">5, p. 459.) However, believers who take their </div><div class="t md14 x3e h2d y392 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">calling seriously must know that their first citizenship is in the kingdom of God. </div><div class="t m771 x16 h2d y65a ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Its goals and principles, therefore, should be our first concern. At the same time </div><div class="t m616 x16 h2d y9e9 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">we must become more aware of the fact that these goals and principles are to be </div><div class="t m481 x16 h2d y852 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">realized in </div><div class="t m9d4 x35 h4a y1614 ff6 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">this </div><div class="t m828 x19 h2d y1614 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">world. To that end Christ sent us into the world so that all </div><div class="t m791 x16 h2d y880 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">people may have opportunity to be saved and come to the knowledge of the </div><div class="t m862 x16 h2d y297 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">truth. (See 1 Tim. 2:4.) The Christian must therefore constantly ask him-</div><div class="t m9fc x16 h2d y1096 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">self: In what ways can I best represent Christ in the world, at work, in my daily </div><div class="t m172 x16 h2d y2cf ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">activities, among neighbors and friends? And by what attitudes, life-style, and </div><div class="t md5 x16 h2d y146e ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">behavior can I best make the kingdom of God a present reality as well as a hope </div><div class="t m628 x16 h2d ye26 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">for the future? </div><div class="t m1a5b x165 h6c yfd0 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">5 </div></div><div class="pi" data-data='{"ctm":[1.000000,0.000000,0.000000,1.000000,0.000000,0.000000]}'></div></div>
