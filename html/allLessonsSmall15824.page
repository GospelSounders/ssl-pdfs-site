Note that the series is not intended to </div><div class="t m87c xda h35 y1953 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">be a study of Revelation 14 directly. </div><div class="t m3be x92 h35 y1cf5 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">It may be helpful in studying the lessons to have some idea of how they fit </div><div class="t mf7 xda h35 y1a78 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">into the series. Thus an explanation is given in the following paragraphs of how </div><div class="t m396 xda h35 y1c8c ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">each quarter&apos;s lessons during 1976 relate to the curriculum plan. </div><div class="t m230 x15 h35 y14c2 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The second angel&apos;s message announces Babylon&apos;s fall which results from </div><div class="t ma54 xda h35 y164b ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">making all nations drink of her wine.

This worship </div><div class="t m648 xda h35 y184b ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">is in opposition to the worship of the Creator called for by the first angel. Thus </div><div class="t m35a xda h35 y1b99 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the second and third messages present opposition to the gospel and the worship </div><div class="t m127 xda h35 y17f1 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of the Creator.
