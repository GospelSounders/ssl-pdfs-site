I explained that some-</div><div class="t m133f x3e h27 y832 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">times we need to get personal, even go into the audience to encour-</div><div class="t m86a x3e h27 y206e ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">age one with whom we have been working to make that decision </div><div class="t mac0 x3e h27 y122e ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">for baptism. </div><div class="t m847 x73 h27 y1cef ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">As I spoke I walked into the group of lay workers and ap-</div><div class="t m191a x16 h27 y564 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">proached one young woman. I looked into her eyes and said, &quot;You </div><div class="t m49 x16 h27 y793 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">know, this may be the time that God has chosen for you to decide </div><div class="t me71 x16 h27 y1098 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">for Christ. Don&apos;t take a chance on waiting. Come, God loves you; </div><div class="t m4f x16 h27 yd01 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">all of us love you. We want you in God&apos;s kingdom. Come.&quot; </div><div class="t mac0 x73 h27 yff3 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">With those words, I took her arm and invited her to walk to the </div><div class="t me35 x16 h27 y7d0 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">front of the room with me. She walked with me to the front. After I </div><div class="t m361 x16 h27 yd71 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">closed my demonstration call with prayer, I thanked her, and she </div><div class="t m56 x16 h27 yd3b ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">returned to her seat. Throughout the demonstration the young </div><div class="t m55d x16 h27 y890 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">woman had said nothing. </div><div class="t m90 x73 h27 yaab ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I continued with class. During our noon break several people </div><div class="t m1d01 x16 h27 y1007 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">came to talk to me. This girl stood a few feet away but left before I </div><div class="t mf63 x16 h27 yc7b ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">could speak with her. Later one of the other students came to me </div><div class="t ma29 x16 h27 ya93 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and told me that the girl with whom I had made the appeal had </div><div class="t m19f6 x16 h27 yd0b ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">confided in him that she wanted to be baptized on Sabbath. </div><div class="t m2eb x74 h27 yee1 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I learned that this young girl had grown up in an Adventist </div><div class="t m3e9 x71 h27 yf3d ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">home but had never made her decision to be baptized. But during </div><div class="t m667 x71 h27 ycae ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">my call, the call that I thought was only a demonstration, she felt </div><div class="t mbb x71 h27 y100a ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">God speaking directly to her. </div><div class="t m44a x74 h27 yd41 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Later that day I spoke with her.

No one except God. God directed you to approach me </div><div class="t m42c x71 h27 yd44 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">rather than someone else.&quot; </div><div class="t m10fe x74 h27 yd80 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">We made arrangements to close the training class with a bap-</div><div class="t m1e4 x71 h27 y14b0 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tism on Sabbath afternoon.
