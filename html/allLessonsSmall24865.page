But though </div><div class="t m10ff x14 h27 y23c6 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">it may have seemed new to His hearers at the time, this was not a new </div><div class="t m73d x14 h27 y1036 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">command. It reflected the will and character of God since the very </div><div class="t m44a x14 h27 ydd7 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">beginning. As John wrote in the previous letter, &quot;This command I am </div><div class="t m117f x14 h27 y132f ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">writing you is not new; it is the old command, the one you have had </div><div class="t m5b2 x14 h27 y1d46 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">from the very beginning. The old command is the message you have </div><div class="t m1578 x14 h27 y8df ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">already heard. But the command I now write you is new, because its </div><div class="t m28e x14 h27 y20b0 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">truth is seen in Christ and also in you&quot; (1 John 2:7, 8, TEV). God&apos;s </div><div class="t m1c9 x14 h27 yf87 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">command becomes new in the person of Jesus Christ—in Him it is </div><div class="t m869 x14 h27 y144e ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">most clearly revealed. This command was at the heart of Jesus&apos; </div><div class="t m55d x14 h27 y53b ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">message. </div><div class="t ma95 x36 h87 y122 ff1 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Commands sometimes seem like trying to force people to </div><div class="t ma3b x14 h87 y900 ff1 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">do something against their will. Is this what God wants? John </div><div class="t m2fc x14 h87 y34b ff1 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">7:17. </div><div class="t m47 x36 h27 y2df ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Only by walking in the truth can we find true obedience, which </div><div class="t m165c x14 h27 y1f89 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">does not come through force or compulsion. We need to emphasize </div><div class="t m6a0 x14 h27 y142b ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">this point, for the devil has been very successful in suggesting that </div><div class="t mafd x14 h27 y1ca7 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">God does indeed operate this way. It can be said that ideas of divinely-</div><div class="t m580 x14 h27 y159 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">approved coercion are to be found in every example of human reli-</div><div class="t m5bb x14 h27 yaae ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">gion. But since Jesus stresses the love command, it becomes clear that </div><div class="t m8b0 x14 h27 ydb9 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">God never compels or pressures any of His children to obey Him. </div><div class="t m134 x14 h27 y1f90 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Indeed, to operate from such principles of force and compulsion </div><div class="t m82e x14 h27 y1592 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">would be to negate the whole great controversy and its evidence, </div><div class="t me5e x4a h27 y513 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">accumulated at such tremendous cost.
