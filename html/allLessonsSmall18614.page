The fact that we all have a conscience does not mean that </div><div class="t mf32 x49 h28 y8b2 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">we all have the same evaluations of right and wrong (which are </div><div class="t m10ed x49 h28 ya74 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">influenced by our concept of what is good and what is bad). As some have </div><div class="t m281 x49 h28 y1501 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">suggested, law is essentially an aspect of culture. Men&apos;s concepts of </div><div class="t m463 x53 h28 y599 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">good or bad are largely nurtured by cultural backgrounds. </div><div class="t m1ee x7e h28 yec8 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Because circumstances and cultures differ, human law is somewhat </div><div class="t m393 x49 h28 y798 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">relative. For example, in severe weather conditions, when food </div><div class="t ma22 x53 h28 y799 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">supply is low, the permitting of infants or the aged to die is acceptable </div><div class="t m3ba x53 h28 y8bd ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">among some peoples. </div><div class="t m1bdd x7e h28 y1256 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">As behavior permissible by law may differ widely, so with standards </div><div class="t m1147 x53 h28 yef9 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of goodness, unless tied to divine law and instruction.

Some argue that it differs little from </div><div class="t m13e4 x53 h28 y75e ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">giving tips to a taxi driver, a barber, or a waitress in the restaurant. If </div><div class="t m15b0 x53 h28 y1044 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">small tips are sanctioned by the government, when and why do &quot;bigger </div><div class="t m19f7 x53 h28 y7bb ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tips&quot; become corruption? In the area of fashions, there are other </div><div class="t mafa x53 h28 y82a ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">issues.

The sense of appropriateness of a certain standard is </div><div class="t m5bb x55 h28 yafa ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">often temporal. </div><div class="t m1d7 x35 h28 y70a ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">These illustrations show that each person and group has his or </div><div class="t m7e8 x55 h28 y7c0 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">their own set of inward laws which are the result of culture, education, </div><div class="t m56 x55 h28 y1259 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">socioeconomic status, occupation, age, location, religion, and a </div><div class="t m674 x55 h28 y530 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">number of other factors.
