The eyes are inclined to turn downward </div><div class="t me8c x29 h2d y2d76 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and inward rather than outward and upward. Furthermore, troubles may </div><div class="t mac1 x29 h2d y2bed ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">cause us to reason that somehow we have wandered from God and that </div><div class="t m90 x29 h2d y2b33 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">there is not much use to pray. </div><div class="t m2bb xc5 h2d y2af1 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">In any case, Satan is most successful at undermining the faith of those </div><div class="t m759 x29 h2d y2a96 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">who fail to persist in prayer in times of trouble. This is why Jesus stated </div><div class="t mcdd x29 h2d y2a0f ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that &quot;men ought always to pray, and not to faint&quot; (Luke 18:1). </div><div class="t mdc8 xc5 h2d y2388 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Conversely, as we are inclined to lose our hold on God because of trou-</div><div class="t m3b0 x29 h2d y2307 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ble, we also are inclined to do so when there is no trouble. When the sky </div><div class="t me62 x29 h2d y15f7 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">is cloudless we feel no need of shelter from a storm. And when life is </div><div class="t mf02 x29 h2d yfdf ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">trouble-free, we may forget that it is so because of the goodness of God. </div><div class="t m25b xc5 h6c y15ae ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Why is it necessary to call the church elders to anoint and pray for a sick </div><div class="t m873 x29 h6c yff0 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">individual as instructed in James 5:14? </div><div class="t m1184 xc5 h2d yc77 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The oil referred to in our text cannot be understood as being used as a </div><div class="t m375 x29 h2d y837 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">medicine.
