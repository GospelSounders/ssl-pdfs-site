For all these years I was nothing </div><div class="t ma9a x28 h22 y15f2 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">more than a secular humanist. But during the last few months a </div><div class="t m468 x28 h22 y955 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">whole new joyous life has opened to me. </div><div class="t m2fc x5b h22 y20b3 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">My dear friend Brenda suffered from a terminal illness, and I </div><div class="t mdf x28 h22 y1bda ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">spent a lot of time with her. For almost four months a group of </div><div class="t m38a x28 h22 ya0c ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">kind people who didn&apos;t even know Brenda brought meals to her </div><div class="t m7fc x28 h22 y7ca ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">home every day. I noticed something different about these people. </div><div class="t m37e x28 h22 ybcd ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">They lived like real Christians. Brenda&apos;s husband, Nick, services </div><div class="t m132f x28 h22 y630 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">computers, and one of his clients is the General Conference of-</div><div class="t me0f x28 h22 y52 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">fices. As Nick became acquainted with some workers at the church&apos;s </div><div class="t m349 x28 h22 y6ce ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">headquarters, he told them about Brenda&apos;s illness, and those people </div><div class="t m1761 x28 h22 y9a0 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">began praying with him. Some of them began bringing food by for </div><div class="t macf x28 h22 y104c ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the family. Nick started studying the Bible with them, searching </div><div class="t m25 x4e h22 y1c5b ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">for answers to his deepest questions. </div><div class="t m694 x65 h22 y1a7a ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">After Brenda&apos;s death I continued to visit Nick and his daughter </div><div class="t m8d2 x4e h22 y193f ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Doreen to help them through their grief. Sometimes we had strong </div><div class="t m31b x4e h22 y4ac ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">discussions about religion. One day Nick challenged me, &quot;Have </div><div class="t m692 x4e h22 y1029 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">you ever read the Bible?&quot; I accepted Nick&apos;s challenge and started </div><div class="t m4d2 x4e h22 ye7c ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">reading the Bible. Then Nick loaned me a book on Daniel. The </div><div class="t m505 x4e h22 y1de3 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Bible became real to me. I read the Christian literature hungrily. </div><div class="t m633 x65 h22 y93 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Nick invited me to one of the Bible studies at his house. I went, </div><div class="t m1084 x4e h22 y43c ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">but I resisted some ideas and had lots of questions about what we </div><div class="t m807 x4e h22 y37d ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">were studying. Through it all Dr. Erwin Gane, the teacher, was so </div><div class="t mab8 x4e h22 y10fe ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">patient and accepting. I kept coming. For most of my life I seemed </div><div class="t m1754 x4e h22 y1b8e ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to be looking into a mirror of self reliance; now I seemed to be </div><div class="t md0d x4e h22 y1396 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">climbing a ladder, reaching out to Jesus. </div><div class="t m1631 x65 h22 y321 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Finally I surrendered my life to Jesus and was baptized. It was </div><div class="t m361 x4e h22 y52b ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the most joyful day of my life. I have met wonderful new friends </div><div class="t m377 x4e h22 y100b ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in Christ.
