KINDNESS WINS ONE AND LOSES ANOTHER (Matt. 26:1-16). </div><div class="t m45e x74 h27 y2f21 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The stage was set in a wealthy home around a banquet table at which </div><div class="t m100 x71 h27 y2cfa ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">reclined the honored guest, the Messiah and future King. Around Him </div><div class="t m8e4 x71 h27 y2b89 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">were His twelve future princes, each of whom coveted the highest place in </div><div class="t mf9 x71 h27 y2c98 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the kingdom. His host was a familiar personage to those in Jerusalemâ€”</div><div class="t m1196 x71 h27 y2c9e ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">wealthy, prestigious, competent in legal matters, but recently a changed </div><div class="t mec4 x71 h27 y2960 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">man, the product of one of the King&apos;s miracles. And there were others, but </div><div class="t m694 x71 h27 y2368 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">they were supposed to remain in the kitchen, out of sight. </div><div class="t m803 x74 h27 y23bf ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Mary, the sister of Lazarus and Martha, seemingly oblivious to the </div><div class="t m674 x71 h27 yf11 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;pious&quot; judgments of the assembled guests, crept into the dining room </div><div class="t m561 x71 h27 y1f5f ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">where the guests were reclining at the table, broke an expensive flask of </div><div class="t mea8 x16 h27 y1ccc ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">extravagant perfume, and poured it on Jesus&apos; feet, wiping them with her </div><div class="t m55f x16 h27 y16c6 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">long hair and washing them with her tears of love. </div><div class="t m309 x74 h27 y2b0 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Though she did not intend anyone but Jesus to notice, the strong scent </div><div class="t m61b x16 h27 yc16 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">soon betrayed her presence. Immediately, the. disciples and the host, </div><div class="t m568 x16 h27 y1edf ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Simon, began to list their legal judgments. Surely, if Jesus knew her past, </div><div class="t m1e8 x16 h27 y5cf ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">He would have nothing to do with such a woman. </div><div class="t m6b x74 h27 y1a3a ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Judas&apos; objection seemed very much to the point: &quot; &apos;Why this waste? </div><div class="t m166f x71 h27 y17d5 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">For this ointment might have been sold for a large sum, and given to the </div><div class="t m14b0 x16 h27 y16ab ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">poor&apos; &quot; (Matt. 26:8, 9, RSV; compare John 12:4-6). </div><div class="t m7a0 x16 h87 y186a ff1 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">1. </div><div class="t m76d x74 h87 y186a ff1 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">How did.

Matt. 26:10-13. </div><div class="t me06 x74 h27 y129 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Those who have suffered group criticism for some act of social kind-</div><div class="t mdcf x71 h27 y16b4 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ness or religious devotion can fully appreciate Jesus&apos; words. There is </div><div class="t m6f x71 h27 y179d ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">nothing so heartless and cruel as condemnation of those whom Christ </div><div class="t m164d x16 h27 y1c5d ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">has forgiven and redeemed. Since Christ no longer condemns believers </div><div class="t m678 x16 h27 y5d ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">(Rom. 8:1), what right do we have to remember their sins against them? </div><div class="t mec2 x16 h87 y1783 ff1 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">2. </div><div class="t mff x74 h87 y1783 ff1 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">What was the result of Jesus&apos; commendation of Mary?

But had Christ unmasked Judas, </div><div class="t m1d8 x16 h27 y175c ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">this would have been urged as a reason for the betrayal. And though </div><div class="t mbb7 x16 h27 y16bf ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">charged with being a thief, Judas would have gained sympathy, even </div><div class="t m915 x16 h27 y17ff ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">among the disciples. The Saviour reproached him not, and thus avoided </div><div class="t m13e4 x16 h27 y16ea ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">giving him an excuse for his treachery. </div><div class="t mab7 x74 h27 y187f ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;But the look which Jesus cast upon Judas convinced him that the </div><div class="t m3e8 x16 h27 y163a ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Saviour penetrated his hypocrisy, and read his base, contemptible </div><div class="t m1328 x16 h27 yc66 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">character. And in commending Mary&apos;s action, which had been so </div><div class="t m7e8 x16 h27 y16a1 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">severely condemned, Christ had rebuked Judas. Prior to this, the Saviour </div><div class="t m571 x16 h27 y1620 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">had never given him a direct rebuke. Now the reproof rankled in his </div><div class="t m313 x16 h27 y370 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">heart. He determined to be revenged.
