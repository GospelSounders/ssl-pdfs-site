If one had lived wholly for self half his life, and </div><div class="t m69d x14 h4 y1f5d ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">then it were possible to turn completely about and serve the Lord </div><div class="t mf55 x14 h4 y1731 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">with all his mind and strength the remainder of his days, he would </div><div class="t m127 x14 h4 y12f0 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">not have served the Lord with all his heart, soul, strength, and mind, </div><div class="t ma09 x4a h4 y14c1 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">any more than if he had half served the Lord all his days. Who, </div><div class="t m1ba x14 h4 y128b ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">then, can be saved ?—Only he who gives up his whole life, past and </div><div class="t m736 x14 h4 y10c1 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">present, to the Lord, and takes in exchange Christ&apos;s life. The per-</div><div class="t m2c4 x4a h4 y1b0d ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">fect life of Christ will be put in place of the sinful life that is past, </div><div class="t m821 x4a h4 y1356 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and the mind of Christ in him now will be as loyal to God as it was </div><div class="t mb65 x14 h4 y12f3 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in the person of Jesus of Nazareth. In short, the condition of eternal </div><div class="t m87b x4a h4 yd1d ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">life is to receive it from the Lord. He who allows the life of God to </div><div class="t m7bf x14 h4 y11e0 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">manifest itself in his mortal flesh, will finally have that same eternal </div><div class="t m772 x4a h4 y12f5 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">life in his immortal flesh. </div><div class="t m2b6 x61 h4 y10d9 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">3. </div><div class="t m192 xc h4 y13d6 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot; WHO is my neighbor? &quot; Read the story and see.

John 8 : 48. They regarded the Samaritans as dogs. The </div><div class="t m18f x4a h4 y1ec4 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Jews, therefore, had done nothing to merit kindness at the hands of </div><div class="t m194 x4a h4 y1a2a ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the Samaritans. Yet this Samaritan did great kindness to the Jew, </div><div class="t m2e5 x4a h4 y12fd ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">who would doubtless have spit upon him if he had seen him in the </div><div class="t ma97 x4a h4 y1c33 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">same situation. It is said that the Samaritan had mercy upon the </div><div class="t m1a7 x4a h4 y110f ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">other. Therefore mercy is the treatment of people better than they </div><div class="t m858 x4a h4 y1544 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">deserve.
