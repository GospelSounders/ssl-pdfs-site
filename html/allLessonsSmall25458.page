His lifelong acceptance of atheism wrestled </div><div class="t m18ec x11 h27 y295a ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">with the concept of God. Gradually he became convinced that life is </div><div class="t m190e x11 h27 y244a ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the work of a super intelligence. But who or what was it? He sought </div><div class="t m56c x11 h27 yc43 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">an answer in the Russian Orthodox Church, but he had no personal </div><div class="t m2046 x11 h27 y1492 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">relationship with God. </div><div class="t mbc7 x5d h27 y18d ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Igor returned to his home in Omsk and enrolled in the university </div><div class="t m136b x11 h27 y2095 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to study English. When he learned that an Australian pastor was </div><div class="t m8e0 x11 h27 y3b8 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">conducting evangelistic meetings in the city, he decided to go. It </div><div class="t mec5 x11 h27 y8f5 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">would be a good chance to improve his English. </div><div class="t md7 x5d h27 yd1 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">He enjoyed listening to the English speaker. When he spoke on </div><div class="t m766 x11 h27 y14c ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the prophecy of Daniel 2, Igor recognized the empires that rose and </div><div class="t m1c7d x17 h27 y20e ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">fellâ€”Medo-Persia, Greece, Rome. This prophecy offered compel-</div><div class="t m1177 x17 h27 y580 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ling evidence that the Bible is true. From that time on Igor attended </div><div class="t m3a6 x17 h27 y22b ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the meetings for another reason: to learn more about the Bible. </div><div class="t ma19 x5d h27 yb1 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">When the pastor invited listeners to follow Jesus in baptism, Igor </div><div class="t m10ff x11 h27 y5eb ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">stepped forward. That night he told his wife of his decision to be a </div><div class="t m608 x17 h27 y335 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Christian. He expected her to rejoice with him, but instead, she </div><div class="t m145e x17 h27 y6df ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">became angry. &quot;I&apos;ll not be a Christian!

His wife left him; the university refused to excuse him from </div><div class="t me49 x17 h27 yd33 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">classes on Saturday; and Igor refused to break the Sabbath, even if it </div><div class="t m10ed x3e h27 y406 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">meant he would be expelled.
