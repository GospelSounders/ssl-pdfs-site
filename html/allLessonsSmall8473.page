He was broken in </div><div class="t mabb x11 he y2334 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">spirit by the consciousness of his sin and its far-reaching results. He felt hum-</div><div class="t m3e5 x17 he y23cc ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">bled in the eyes of his subjects. His influence was weakened. Hitherto his </div><div class="t m38f x17 he y2002 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">prosperity had been attributed to his conscientious obedience to the command-</div><div class="t m27f x17 he y1e80 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ments of the Lord. But now his subjects, having a knowledge of his sin, would </div><div class="t m25d x17 he y3fe ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">be led to sin more freely. His authority in his own household, his claim to </div><div class="t mabb x17 he y169b ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">respect and obedience from his sons, was weakened. A sense of his guilt kept </div><div class="t m326 x17 he y1736 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">him silent when he should have condemned sin; it made his arm feeble to </div><div class="t m75c x17 he yc16 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">execute justice in his house. His evil example exerted its influence upon his </div><div class="t m2eb x17 he y67f ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sons, and God would not interpose to prevent the result.
