The man raced for his life, not daring to stop. Ahead, the </div><div class="t mad1 x71 h27 y2427 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">pathway dropped into the river. </div><div class="t m156 x61 h27 y21f8 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">With the tiger nearly upon him, the man leaped for a vine </div><div class="t mdbb x71 h27 y20a0 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">hanging down from the trees overhead.
