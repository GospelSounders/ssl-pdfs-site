Nations and </div><div class="t me72 x71 h27 y2c2d ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">people may vary as to the names of the months, or the number of the years, </div><div class="t m55f x71 h27 y2bd6 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">or when the years begin and end; but all can count from one to seven, and </div><div class="t me3e x71 h27 y2cb2 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">all may know when the Sabbath, the seventh day of the week, comes </div><div class="t m9fc x71 h27 y2cc1 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">around. It is important to know that the weekly cycle has never been </div><div class="t mdcf x71 h27 y2881 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">changed.

We can be sure that the seventh day in the twentieth century is </div><div class="t mec7 x71 h27 y1ed5 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the same seventh day that Jesus observed as the Sabbath. </div><div class="t mb90 x71 h87 yc14 ff1 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">7. </div><div class="t m766 x74 h87 y16c6 ff1 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">What interesting personification is made of the sun? Ps. 19:5, 6. </div><div class="t m563 x74 h27 y1d33 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The sun is a dependable timepiece in the heavens. From our standpoint </div><div class="t m1146 x71 h27 y193b ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">it moves obediently, regularly, strongly, and effectively.

If we do this in the twentieth century with all our learning </div><div class="t m1105 x71 h27 y187d ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and advancement in science, we can surely let the psalmist draw his pic-</div><div class="t m77f x71 h27 y179c ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ture, and understand what he means. He is telling us that God is the God of </div><div class="t mae x71 h27 yc24 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">order, and He is in control. We can still use our sundials, and know the </div><div class="t m460 x71 h27 y8e4 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">time of day. We can still navigate by the stars and know the direction we </div><div class="t m19f3 x71 h27 yb3b ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">are taking.
