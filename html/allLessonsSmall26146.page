When a friend invited him to attend a Christian church service, </div><div class="t m18c3 x14 h27 y736 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Sofyan refused. But his friend was persistent, and finally Sofyan </div><div class="t mef2 x14 h27 yb74 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">agreed to attend, partly to please his friend and partly out of curiosity. </div><div class="t meda x28 h27 y2028 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">As he neared the church building, he glanced nervously in all </div><div class="t m678 x14 h27 y776 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">directions.
