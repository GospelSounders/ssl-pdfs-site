It probably was </div><div class="t m167d x73 h2b y280 ff4 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">written in Corinth in the spring of A. D. 57 or 58.

Do not hurry. Do not seek to give a whole verse for </div><div class="t m1382 x73 h2b yebb ff4 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">an answer to a question, when a word will suffice. Use only that part of </div><div class="t m704 x73 h2b y48b ff4 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the scripture necessary to answer the question.
