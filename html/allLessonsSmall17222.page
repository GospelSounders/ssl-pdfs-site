While many in </div><div class="t m1578 x11 h35 y1585 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the world have followed selfish pleasure, eating and drinking, marrying and giving in </div><div class="t mac4 x11 h35 ya5 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">marriage without regard to God and His principles of righteousness, others have </div><div class="t m38a x11 h35 yf4 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">recognized that life has no meaning if it is not related to God who created the world, </div><div class="t ma8 x11 h35 y50c ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and activity is empty and futile if it is not imbued with a spirit of love and gratitude. </div><div class="t mdf7 x18 h35 y87a ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The basic concept of these lessons is stewardship and responsibility. We are not </div><div class="t m145e x11 h35 y386 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">our own, free to do whatever we please. We are not ourselves the source of what we </div><div class="t m292 x11 h35 y4c9 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">are and have. All is of grace. We are born into a community where there are duties and </div><div class="t m393 x11 h35 ya38 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">obligations to God and to one another. The center of our thinking is to be for others, </div><div class="t md28 x11 h35 y3ed ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">as God&apos;s concern has been for us. We live in a world of interrelationships, with ties </div><div class="t mb63 x11 h35 y174 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that cannot be lightly severed. Thus we need to learn how we can relate to God and </div><div class="t m567 x11 h35 y580 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">other persons and on what basis we should do so. In this way we can experience a </div><div class="t ma49 x11 h35 ybc6 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">fullness of life. </div><div class="t m55c x18 h35 y595 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">We begin our lessons by noting some characteristics of our heavenly Father. It is </div><div class="t ma30 x11 h35 y1b8 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">because of what God is and does for man that man finds himself willingly acknow-</div><div class="t m778 x11 h35 y2fd ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ledging his obligationsto Him. It is not a matter of blind obedience, legal and cold, but </div><div class="t m4d2 x11 h35 yebb ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">a response of love because of God&apos;s love for man. </div><div class="t m309 x4a h35 y3f1 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">This response may take many forms, and it is these various forms that we will study </div><div class="t me73 x11 h35 y100 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">after the first lesson. We will notice first that there will be a consent to pay a tithe of all </div><div class="t m1082 x17 h35 ycf5 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">increase so that there will always be money in the treasury to do the work of the Lord. </div><div class="t m4cd x17 h35 ydd ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Additional offerings will flow from a heart of love and gratitude. </div><div class="t m770 x4a h35 y1d6 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Work, which was assigned to man from the beginning, is looked upon as a privilege </div><div class="t m455 x17 h35 yd33 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and a blessing, especially that work which furthers God&apos;s plans and purposes. To </div><div class="t mcdd x17 h35 y366 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">witness to the truth, to follow in the footsteps of the Master, and to live on earth as </div><div class="t me2c x11 h35 y451 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Jesus lived, these are activities that are basic to the person wholly dedicated to God. </div><div class="t mb91 x4a h35 y15a ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">There is always a concern for others, for others are not always as privileged as </div><div class="t m14bb x17 h35 y6aa ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">some. One must not close one&apos;s eyes to the needy all around. There is therefore a </div><div class="t m3c0 x17 h35 y94 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">constant giving, which is the corollary of a constant receiving from the heavenly </div><div class="t m1358 x17 h35 y1a6 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Father. </div><div class="t mad2 x4a h35 y21b ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The ties of the family are especially important. The parents are as God to their </div><div class="t m156 x17 h35 y6e4 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">children, and they have the responsibility of seeing that their children receive a </div><div class="t m173a x17 h35 y134e ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Christian heritage. As the children grow older, they need to be trained for the service </div><div class="t m1f8 x17 h35 y2a9 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of God and man. The Christian school has a definite role to play that may be costly, </div><div class="t m5d8 x17 h35 y711 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">but that must not be neglected. </div><div class="t m8a7 x4a h35 y454 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">A suitable place for worship is also the responsibility of God&apos;s dedicated people to </div><div class="t mb05 x17 h35 y26 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">provide. Just as God asked for the building of the tabernacle that He might dwell </div><div class="t mc6 x17 h35 y340 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">among His people in the days of old, so God expects His people to gather together for </div><div class="t m68e x3e h35 y294 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">worship today. At the same time God&apos;s people preach the gospel to hasten the second </div><div class="t m36d x3e h35 y40f ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">coming. </div><div class="t m313 x4a h35 y4d0 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">None of these responses is of merit toward salvation. Jesus&apos; righteousness alone </div><div class="t m132f x3e h35 y9f ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">gains admission to the kingdom for His people. But those whom He has saved will </div><div class="t md10 x3e h35 y30a ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">cooperate with the Lord in His work for this lost world. </div><div class="t m1121 x17b h5 ye1e ff3 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">7 </div></div><div class="pi" data-data='{"ctm":[1.000000,0.000000,0.000000,1.000000,0.000000,0.000000]}'></div></div>
