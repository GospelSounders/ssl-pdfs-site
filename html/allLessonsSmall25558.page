I knew nothing about the </div><div class="t m1138 x18 h27 y288d ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">church or the people who worshiped there, except that they were </div><div class="t m1df x18 h27 y23af ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">different. My friends and I sometimes threw stones and shouted </div><div class="t m1857 x18 h27 y2361 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">accusations at the believers as we walked by the church. </div><div class="t m7d5 x29 h27 y1616 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Some years later a friend told me that, according to Revelation </div><div class="t m14b0 x4a h27 y1d79 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">13, the Catholic and Protestant churches would combine and per-</div><div class="t m42d x4a h27 y191e ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">secute Christians who kept God&apos;s laws. I could not understand </div><div class="t m685 x4a h27 y1824 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">how Christians could hurt other Christians. Then I began to won-</div><div class="t mf6b x4a h27 ya54 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">der who were these Christians who kept God&apos;s law. </div><div class="t mcc5 x29 h27 y375 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Shortly after I was married, my wife became a Seventh-day Adventist. </div><div class="t m204d x4a h27 y1721 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I was not happy when she told me, for I still thought this church was </div><div class="t m8a x4a h27 y179a ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">a bad church. I got angry when she refused to go to the market or </div><div class="t mee x4a h27 yc1a ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">cook on Saturday or when she refused to eat certain foods, even </div><div class="t md11 x4a h27 y1769 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">though she prepared them for me.

Something had changed. </div><div class="t m453 x29 h27 y1895 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I went to another area of Zaire to work in the gold mines. I </div><div class="t me2 x4a h27 y17f1 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">discovered that the Adventist church was there too! Curious, I </div><div class="t m7e2 x4a h27 y5d1 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">decided to attend a service. As I listened to the preacher and </div><div class="t m1488 x4a h27 y337 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">studied the texts he gave, many of the things my wife did began to </div><div class="t m168b x4a h27 y1989 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">make sense to me. I liked the way Adventists worshiped too. They </div><div class="t m1348 x4a h27 y1ac5 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">did not shout or play loud music as my church did. When I learned </div><div class="t maff x4a h27 y158e ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">about returning a tenth of my earnings to God, who gave them to </div><div class="t mec0 x4a h27 y18ff ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">me, I decided to try. I began returning tithe and waited to see what </div><div class="t m256 x4a h27 y182c ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">would happen. Not long after this I found a gold nugget weighing </div><div class="t m317 x4a h27 y17f8 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">about six pounds! </div><div class="t m1d7f x36 h27 y1872 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I returned to Kinshasa and began attending church with my wife.
