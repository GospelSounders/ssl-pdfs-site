Many years ago Ellen G. White issued this </div><div class="t made xb4 h35 y1fe7 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">challenge to the Adventist Church: &quot;Great truths that have lain unheeded and </div><div class="t m7fd xb4 h35 ya67 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">unseen since the day of Pentecost, are to shine from God&apos;s word in their native </div><div class="t m95 xb4 h35 y313 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">purity.

Increased light is never the result </div><div class="t m161b xb4 h35 y1495 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of indolence. Jesus said: &quot;Seek, and ye shall find.&quot; The book of Revelation is </div><div class="t m3c5 xb4 h35 y9d9 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">different from every other book in the New Testament. If we think of the Sermon </div><div class="t mac8 xb4 h35 y4e4 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">on the Mount as the primer of the church, and the Acts of the Apostles as the </div><div class="t m7dc xb4 h35 yd88 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">geography of the church, and the epistles as the ethics of the church, then the </div><div class="t mbe9 xb4 h35 yf88 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Revelation could well be the philosophy of history of the church. </div><div class="t m119d x92 h35 y4ae ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">While it is a revelation of Jesus Christ, it is also a book of music. Seven </div><div class="t m842 xb4 h35 yef7 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">anthems are recorded in these chapters. Through these we can catch the echo of </div><div class="t m798 xb4 h35 y159f ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the celestial choirs. Forty-six times John records hearing voices, and often they </div><div class="t m98e xb4 h35 y450 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">are voices of victory. On occasions devils also are referred to, but they are all </div><div class="t m6c2 xda h35 y56e ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">silent. No song is awakened in Revelation by evil passions. Jesus sang knowing </div><div class="t m18d xb4 h35 y896 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">He was facing crucifixion. Paul and Silas sang in the dark dungeon with their feet </div><div class="t m110f xda h35 y5a0 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in the stocks. The church has always sung her way through trials to triumph. </div><div class="t m2bd xda h35 y8c1 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Thank God for the Christian message that sets the people singing. Hymns, psalms, </div><div class="t m9f7 xda h35 y21b ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">anthems, and oratorios have marked the history of God&apos;s people through the </div><div class="t m65f xda h35 y79b ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">centuries. </div><div class="t m221 x15 h35 y90c ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">During this second series of lessons on the Revelation we will study some of </div><div class="t m854 xda h35 y1939 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the most graphic portions of the book. Prophecies of great import will challenge </div><div class="t m343 xda h35 y7bc ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">our thinking—prophecies which we as Adventists need to understand in order to </div><div class="t m2db xda h35 y574 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">share faith and give a reason for the hope that is within us with meekness and </div><div class="t m428 xda h35 ya6c ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">fear. It was largely the study of the Revelation that brought the advent movement </div><div class="t m4d8 xda h35 y9c ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">into being. Let us pray that the restudy of these great themes will prepare the </div><div class="t m164 xc4 h35 yafb ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">church for the latter rain. In this connection Ellen G. White has said: &quot;When we </div><div class="t m7c8 xda h35 y82d ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">as a people understand what this book [Revelation] means to us, there will be </div><div class="t m338 xda h35 y1625 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">seen among us a great </div><div class="t m3f x5e h35 y79e ff5 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">revival.&quot;—Testimonies to Ministers, </div><div class="t m1464 xa9 h35 y731 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">page 113.
