What is living? </div><div class="t m56 x3 h35 y1b54 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Why is there evil? Where did I come from? Where am I going? Yet never before </div><div class="t m20d x3 h35 y1f15 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">has the question, What is man? been of such overwhelming concern to so many </div><div class="t m698 x3 h35 y17ec ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">people all over the world. </div><div class="t m453 x17 h35 y1762 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The reasons are found in what has been happening to us. Evolutionary theory </div><div class="t m23b xb9 h35 y147e ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">has eroded the view of man as a creature of God, but it has failed to give man </div><div class="t mff x3 h35 y11a ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the meaning of his life and destiny. The revolutionary changes of our time have </div><div class="t m6c0 x3 h35 y1ae4 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">affected every aspect of our lives: our work, our personhood, our relation with </div><div class="t m10b x3 h35 y1869 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">other people, our life-style, our interests, and our morality. The thousand-and-one </div><div class="t m3a2 x3 h35 y1bc0 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">new ideologies and philosophies on man, including the &quot;new morality&quot; and hun-</div><div class="t me9f x3 h35 y17ae ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">dreds of new cults and sects, have caused great intellectual confusion, moral </div><div class="t m8b0 x3 h35 y19ca ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">restlessness, and spiritual bewilderment. </div><div class="t m44b x17 h35 y177e ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">But though there exists a remarkable consensus among thinking people every-</div><div class="t m602 x3 h35 y1893 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">where that man is seriously ill and needs healing, people differ concerning the </div><div class="t m328 x3 h35 y332 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">real causes of man&apos;s illness and brokenness. And how can we even start thinking </div><div class="t m1329 x3 h35 y16fa ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">about healing man before we know for sure what the disease is and what causes </div><div class="t m5e2 x3 h35 y16b1 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">it? But our understanding of the disease and its causes, and our insights into the </div><div class="t m7d0 x3 h35 y185f ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">best way to heal and to help man, hinge on the question, </div><div class="t ma45 x44 h35 y185f ff5 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">What is man? </div><div class="t mb2 x17 h35 yf5b ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">In our scientific age many have turned to science for an answer to the ques-</div><div class="t m350 x3 h35 yc5b ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tions about man. Science has given us many insights and great power; but to the </div><div class="t m25d x3 h35 y1ed6 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">question, What is man? it has no answer. &quot;Man is,&quot; wrote Alexis Carrel, scientist </div><div class="t m6fa x3 h35 y1f25 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and Nobel Prize winner for physiology, &quot;a great unknown, and a stranger.&quot; </div><div class="t m45d x3e h35 y1a6f ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Many in our day, therefore, are turning to philosophy, mysticism, occultism, or </div><div class="t m883 x3 h35 y339 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">spiritualism to find an answer to the pressing question, What is man? But, though </div><div class="t mca x3 h35 y6a8 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">philosophy has greatly enhanced our understanding of man, its insights and find-</div><div class="t ma78 x3 h35 y16b7 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ings are so diverse and so contradictory that it is impossible to find in existen-</div><div class="t m96 xbd h35 y1972 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tialism, Marxism, vitalism, humanism, or any of the many other &quot;isms&quot; a view of </div><div class="t m6b3 x3 h35 y187e ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">man that is central to them all and that could guide us in the struggles, ques-</div><div class="t m2bb xbd h35 yb45 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tions, and perplexities of life. Philosophers and mystics are human too. They can </div><div class="t m1f3 x3 h35 y1701 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">look at man only from within their own limited human experience. But there is </div><div class="t m10f x3 h35 y28f ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">no real knowledge about man within man himself. </div><div class="t mf3 x3e h35 yc2c ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">To find out, therefore, who and what we are, we must go beyond the limita-</div><div class="t m7e6 xbd h35 ya3b ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tions set by our own senses and experiences. We must turn to a source that lies </div><div class="t m21b x3 h35 y6b1 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">outside of man. That source we find in God&apos;s revelation; that is, in the inspired </div><div class="t mb7 xbd h35 y1d97 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Word of God. Who but the Spirit of God really understands our minds, and who </div><div class="t m31d xbd h35 y17a4 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">but God knows our hearts? And as a man thinks in his heart, so is he.

This is not a mere </div><div class="t mf4 xbd h35 y1d85 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">theoretical discussion on &quot;dry doctrines&quot;; it is an issue of practical concern. </div><div class="t mb10 xbd h35 y2f ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The Biblical message on man is the only solution to modern man&apos;s confusion, </div><div class="t m555 xbd h35 y19ec ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">restlessness, and bewilderment. It is like a cup of water to a person dying from </div><div class="t mf55 xbd h35 y81 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">thirst in a desert. It is the only medicine that can heal man from his present </div><div class="t m6de xbd h35 y6b9 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">illness, the only cure to restore him from his brokenness. May the insights </div><div class="t m65d xbd h35 yb5c ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">gained during this quarter of Bible study inspire us to go out into the world to </div><div class="t m3bc xbd h35 y191b ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">announce the good news to all men.
