And that </div><div class="t mb41 x7e h28 y9ef ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">involved a challenge to God&apos;s glory. </div><div class="t m15b2 xf h28 y7ce ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">There came a day when Moses asked God for a personal revelation of </div><div class="t m770 x7e h28 y1004 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">His glory. And in His response God touched upon the two major </div><div class="t m5fa x7e h28 y1005 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">aspects of His glory: His goodness (Ex. 33:19) and the overwhelming </div><div class="t m8dd x7e h28 y14aa ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">majesty of His Person (verses 20-23). </div><div class="t m5b3 xf h28 yd57 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">God&apos;s goodness, His character, His selfless love are the foundation </div><div class="t m1d11 x7e h28 ya12 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of His government. The law of His kingdom expresses, in principles that </div><div class="t me71 x7e h28 y83f ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">meet our condition, the nature of God&apos;s character. </div><div class="t m1be4 xf h28 yad7 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">From the few explicit scriptures that speak of Satan&apos;s rebellion and from </div><div class="t me71 x7e h28 y822 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the other few that may make indirect references, we have a picture. </div><div class="t mdef xf h28 y745 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Satan introduced the spirit of self-exaltation into the universe, and </div><div class="t mcf3 x7e h28 ya93 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">through it he has worked constantly to draw to himself glory and honor. </div><div class="t m5b8 x7e h28 y12d3 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">He wants especially the power and praise side of glory. The spirit of </div><div class="t m867 x7e h28 y1244 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Jesus, by contrast, is the spirit of self-sacrifice. It will be His Spirit, &quot;the </div><div class="t md0d x7e h28 yd0c ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">glory shining in the face of Jesus,&quot; that will finally prevail. </div><div class="t mabe xf h28 yfd3 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">When the great rebellion in heaven was first transferred to this earth, </div><div class="t md0d x7e h28 yfd4 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Satan used methods that Christ could not use—lying, deception, immo-</div><div class="t m638 x7e h28 yee5 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">rality, false slogans, and exciting suggestions. Many good people are </div><div class="t m639 x7e h28 y964 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">entrapped, often tragically and permanently, by such lures. </div><div class="t m474 xf h28 yed0 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The object of this lesson is to note the method of approach in some of </div><div class="t m35e x7e h28 yed1 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Satan&apos;s snares. To show that though worldly honor be lost, all the glory </div><div class="t md0d x7e h28 y9f7 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that endures results from following the Christ road. </div><div class="t m26b xf h28 yf4d ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Those who, like the prodigal son, have lost both wealth and the </div><div class="t m690 x7e h28 y14b0 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">father&apos;s home may find themselves feeding on husks. Fortunately, some </div><div class="t m15b0 x7e h28 y968 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">people do learn from life&apos;s experiences and decide to redeem the time </div><div class="t m5b6 x7e h28 yf50 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">by making good use of the remaining opportunities. Such are likened to </div><div class="t m1956 x7e h28 y1211 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">brands, plucked from the fire. (Compare Joshua, the high priest—Zech. </div><div class="t m1007 x7e h28 ydc0 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">3:2.) </div><div class="t me4a xf h28 y804 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Sin has given Satan access to humanity.
