He per-</div><div class="t m134c x14 h28 y2af1 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">formed the ceremonies of his religion and refused to have any-</div><div class="t m555 x14 h28 y29ea ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">thing to do with Christianity. Often he made unkind remarks to </div><div class="t mdd0 x14 h28 y2284 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Christians when they tried to speak to him of their faith. </div><div class="t m75b x36 h28 y210c ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Then Rao became ill with a mysterious affliction that paralyzed </div><div class="t m567 x14 h28 y15ba ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">him from the waist down. Even specialists in a large hospital could </div><div class="t me9a x14 h28 y1f75 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">not help the paralyzed man. His family took him to sacred Hindu </div><div class="t m6da x14 h28 y13f0 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sites hoping that Rao would regain his health, but nothing hap-</div><div class="t m394 x14 h28 y1380 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">pened. Family members offered sacrifices of pigs, goats, and black </div><div class="t m464 x14 h28 yb75 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">chickens at another sacred temple, but still Rao felt no relief. </div><div class="t ma45 x36 h28 y17ad ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Unable to walk, Babu Rao had time to think about his future. A </div><div class="t m1b9 x14 h28 y1562 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Christian friend stopped by to encourage him and to tell Rao that </div><div class="t me1 x14 h28 y116a ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">he and his family were praying for him. Touched, Rao asked him, </div><div class="t m3f x14 h28 y10c0 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Can the Christian&apos;s God help me?&quot; </div><div class="t m19e x36 h28 y144f ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Jehovah God is able to do things that other gods and even </div><div class="t m4ca x14 h28 y1f7a ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">doctors cannot do,&quot; his friend answered. Rao thanked his friend </div><div class="t m390 x14 h28 y1419 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and invited him to come back to visit and pray for him again. </div><div class="t ma2d x36 h28 y15e3 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The Christian friend told his congregation about Rao and urged </div><div class="t m6d7 x14 h28 y83e ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">them to pray for him. For two months the believers held special </div><div class="t m67 x14 h28 yf2e ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">services for Rao, during which the pastor and members fasted and </div><div class="t mf53 x14 h28 y15fa ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">prayed for this Hindu man. </div><div class="t m93 x28 h28 y1566 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Rao began to regain feeling in his right leg. Soon he could place </div><div class="t m671 x14 h28 y13fd ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">his weight on that leg. As feeling returned to his left leg, Babu Rao </div><div class="t m5ab x14 h28 y1311 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">began to walk with the aid of crutches. As soon as possible, he </div><div class="t m32b x14 h28 y10f1 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">attended services at the Adventist church. During a prayer meeting </div><div class="t m631 x5d h28 y145a ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Rao stood and told the members, &quot;I regret the way I spoke to you </div><div class="t m10b x5d h28 yea9 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in the past. Please forgive me. I have learned that Jesus is the true </div><div class="t m812 x14 h28 y133c ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">God.&quot; </div><div class="t m8b x28 h28 y1541 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Babu Rao, the man who stubbornly opposed Christians, ac-</div><div class="t ma3 x5d h28 yecf ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">cepted salvation through Christ and was baptized.

He has shared his testimony with family and friends, </div><div class="t m2bf x5d h28 y1e6b ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and many of them have begun attending church with him. </div><div class="t m44c x28 h28 y14dc ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Babu Rao is not unique.
