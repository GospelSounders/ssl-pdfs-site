After receiving permis-</div><div class="t m110b x26 h28 y2bc6 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sion from the leaders, the youth gathered jungle materials and </div><div class="t mec2 x18 h28 y2c05 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">built a shelter in which to hold public meetings. </div><div class="t md2a x64 h28 y2910 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">It was hard work in the tropical sun. They set up heavy poles to </div><div class="t m1754 x26 h28 y1fe1 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">support the walls and roof, then tied smaller poles in place for the </div><div class="t m6a6 x18 h28 yf11 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">frame of the building.
