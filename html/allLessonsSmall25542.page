His miraculous </div><div class="t m388 x26 h27 y2930 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">escape from death forced him to wonder if God was trying to tell </div><div class="t m13aa x26 h27 y2934 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">him something. But the devil was not willing to let go and tried to </div><div class="t me4a x26 h27 y238f ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">frighten Josef into giving up his search for God. But the devil&apos;s </div><div class="t m805 x26 h27 y1585 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">plan only drove Josef to seek God more intensely. </div><div class="t m32a x61 h27 y944 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Josef spent his free time reading his Bible and studying the </div><div class="t m193b x26 h27 y1277 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Bible correspondence course he had sent for.

He wondered, </div><div class="t m625 x1b h16 y20a ff6 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">How is it that the Bible commands </div><div class="t m3e1 x26 h16 y4bf ff6 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">God&apos;s people to keep the Sabbath, but Christians worship on </div><div class="t me46 x26 h16 y946 ff6 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Sunday? </div><div class="t m1639 x64 h27 yac ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">When he found no one who had an answer, he asked God to </div><div class="t m149b x26 h27 y5b3 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">send him the answer. A few days later he received the next lesson </div><div class="t m1322 x26 h27 ybc6 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in the Bible study course. It was on the Sabbath. He recognized </div><div class="t m992 x26 h27 y176 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">this lesson was God&apos;s answer to his prayer, and he decided he </div><div class="t m777 x26 h27 yae8 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">would keep the Sabbath holyâ€”even if he had to keep it alone. </div><div class="t m711 x64 h27 y31a ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Then he received the Bible lesson that spoke of Jesus&apos; soon </div><div class="t m561 x26 h27 ycc9 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">return. This was another surprise for him. Josef wanted to talk to </div><div class="t m317 x26 h27 y8e ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">someone who could help him understand these new teachings. He </div><div class="t mae x26 h27 y249 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">wrote a letter to the Bible correspondence school, asking if they </div><div class="t m1629 x18 h27 y1bc ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">knew someone in his area who could answer his questions. </div><div class="t m55f x64 h27 y75c ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">A pastor telephoned Josef and arranged to meet him at the train </div><div class="t m66d x18 h27 ya58 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">station.
