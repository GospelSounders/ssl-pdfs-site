The most common </div><div class="t m223 x11 h35 y12f0 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">concept among the religions and philosophies of man, from ancient times until </div><div class="t ma78 x11 h35 y62f ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">today, is that there is something in man that cannot die, that the body may be </div><div class="t m854 x11 h35 y1f94 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">laid to rest, but his spirit or soul lives on. But the Bible teaches that man is a </div><div class="t md04 x11 h35 y10c0 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">total whole, an indivisible unit. He is flesh, soul, heart, and spirit. None of these </div><div class="t m9b x11 h35 y1418 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">terms stands for a part in man that contrasts it with another part.

When He was in the hands of death, Christ felt totally for-</div><div class="t m612 x11 h35 y1cc6 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">saken by God. Mark 15:37. Death is the enemy of God, His last enemy, as the </div><div class="t m746 x11 h35 y1429 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">apostle Paul calls it. 1 Cor. 15:26. Death separates man from God, who is Life </div><div class="t m5cc x11 h35 y108b ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and the Creator of all life. The Christian&apos;s hope in death lies in the resurrec-</div><div class="t m6f1 x11 h35 y1e25 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tion. There also lies our comfort and consolation. 1 Thess. 4:13-18. The whole </div><div class="t m16a x11 h35 y1fd9 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">man will be restored in the resurrection: body, soul, and spirit.

It is a deception </div><div class="t m355 x11 h35 y1055 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that in essence goes back to the satanic lie, &quot;Ye shall not surely die.&quot; Gen. </div><div class="t m88c x11 h35 y1ed3 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">3:4. Such a teaching, therefore, cannot merely be treated as a harmless error; </div><div class="t m192 x11 h35 y135f ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">it must be attacked as a satanic deception, which, in fact, it is.
