For </div><div class="t mdbc x4a h2d y28bb ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">one thing, the psalms are poetry, and the language of poetry has widespread appeal. </div><div class="t m48a x4a h2d y2388 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">For another thing, the psalms reflect the wisdom, praise, and prayers of men of God, </div><div class="t mf6b x4a h2d y875 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">chief among them being King David. Our personal expressions of sorrow, suffer-</div><div class="t m275 x14 h2d y1492 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ing, despair, confidence, victory, and praise are a distant echo of those so eloquent-</div><div class="t m3a6 x4a h2d yc69 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ly expressed by the psalmist. What he says is important to us who would like to fol-</div><div class="t m24f x14 h2d y807 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">low in his footsteps of dedication and service. </div><div class="t m7f0 x36 h2d y155a ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Because there are so many psalms, our Bible book curriculum assigns two </div><div class="t mafd x14 h2d y3c8 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">quarters to study a representative selection. This quarter, after an introductory les-</div><div class="t m1367 x14 h2d y2069 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">son, we will study one psalm each week, focusing on the major topic dealt with in </div><div class="t m56c x14 h2d y792 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that psalm. The psalms that have been selected from the first half of the book will </div><div class="t m1739 x14 h2d y564 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">be studied from the standpoint of practical application to our lives. The important </div><div class="t me44 x14 h2d y765 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">question considered each week will be, What is the psalmist saying, and how does </div><div class="t m1bb7 x14 h2d yaa9 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">his experience apply to us? </div><div class="t m246 x36 h2d y2d9 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">On what basis have we chosen the psalms for individual study? In some cases, </div><div class="t mb3d x14 h2d y3ce ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">we have bowed to popular appeal, as in the case of the Shepherd&apos;s Psalm.

In all cases, we </div><div class="t m2817 x14 h2d y900 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">have felt that the psalmist has something important to say to us, something we ought </div><div class="t m650 x14 h2d yaee ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to note, and something to sing about! </div><div class="t m460 x28 h2d y18a2 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Eight names of persons occurring in the superscriptions to the psalms appear </div><div class="t maf9 x14 h2d y46b ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to be the names of authors, contributors, compilers, musicians, or others associated </div><div class="t m1da1 x14 h2d y1976 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">with the composition, compilation, and use of the sacred lyrics.
