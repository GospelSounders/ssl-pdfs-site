If they had divided it equally among them-</div><div class="t m1d5 x15 h4 y555 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">selves, there would have been scarcely enough for anyone to have </div><div class="t m21c x15 h4 y1c6 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">even the taste of food. And then, most wonderful to relate, there was </div><div class="t m6f3 x15 h4 y1c04 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">much more left, after all had been satisfied, than there was when they </div><div class="t m998 x15 h4 y20b ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">began to eat. W hat more striking illustration could be given of the </div><div class="t m604 x15 h4 y3fc ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">statement that He &quot; is able to do exceeding abundantly, above all that </div><div class="t m621 x15 h4 yf7 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">we ask or think ? Eph. 3 : 20. </div><div class="t m2b6 x71 h4 ya3a ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">3. </div><div class="t m72c x73 h4 y5f7 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">THE question is, Where did that bread come from ? The origi-</div><div class="t m5f3 x15 h4 y260 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">nal amount, instead of being diminished, was increased. There can </div><div class="t m2b2 x15 h4 y847 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">be only one answer : It came from the Lord Jesus Christ Himself. </div><div class="t m103 x15 h4 y1cf ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">He is the Bread of Life. John 6 : 48-51. In this miracle we are </div><div class="t m35f x15 h4 y603 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">again shown how that believing on Him we may have life through His </div><div class="t m299 x27 h4 y56 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">name. For just as He had power in Himself to supply the physical </div><div class="t m119c x15 h4 ydb ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">needs of that multitude, so He has power to supply all our spiritual </div><div class="t mf5a x27 h4 yc46 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">wants. And just as surely as the multitude could eat that bread </div><div class="t m334 x27 h4 y2fe ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">which came from Him, and be nourished by it, so we may really feed </div><div class="t ma78 x27 h4 y3f2 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">upon Christ, and grow thereby. </div><div class="t ma2 x71 h4 ydeb ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">4. </div><div class="t m27e x73 h4 ydeb ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">IT seems incredible that anyone who really believes this miracle </div><div class="t m1d2 x15 h4 y1d7 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">should ever have a doubt of Christ&apos;s power to save us by His own life </div><div class="t mddb x27 h4 y405 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in us. The general objection is that it seems so unreal, so intangible, </div><div class="t m833 x27 h4 y134c ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that we cannot understand how Christ&apos;s life can come into us to make </div><div class="t me4 x27 h4 y5f ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">us strong to do His will. Well, here we have the thing made as sim-</div><div class="t m119 x27 h4 y269 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ple as the supply of daily bread for our physical strength. Let us go </div><div class="t mdd8 x27 h4 y303 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to the very beginning of the matter. There is nobody who has any </div><div class="t ma7b x27 h4 y5d5 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">doubt that the food which we eat day by day gives us strength. We </div><div class="t m7fb x27 h4 y84a ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">become faint and ready to die through long fasting; we eat good food, </div><div class="t m717 x27 h4 y68 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and our strength and life come again. That food becomes part of our </div><div class="t md3 x27 h4 y69 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">blood, and the strength and the life which•we feel renewed in us are </div><div class="t m12c x27 h4 y26e ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the strength and the life that were in the food that we ate. And yet, </div><div class="t m810 x27 h4 y84b ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">as we look at the bread, we can see no life in it, and it does not look at </div><div class="t m7a7 x27 h4 y87e ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">at all like flesh and blood. If we had not been used to receiving </div><div class="t mcd1 x27 h4 y161 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">strength all our lives through eating food,—if we had been miracu-</div><div class="t m1171 x27 h4 y4ef ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">lously kept alive till manhood without food,—and at the age of </div><div class="t mf95 x27 h4 y84d ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">twenty-one were told that our life in the future depended on our eat-</div><div class="t m898 x27 h4 y659 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ing bread, the majority of people would starve to death. Very few </div><div class="t m21b x27 h4 y2ab ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">would believe that any life could come from such a source. Scientists </div><div class="t mda x27 h4 y325 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">would be ready to demonstrate the impossibility of forming flesh and </div><div class="t m94 x27 h4 y359 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">blood out of bread. It is a merciful provision of Gil for the preser-</div><div class="t m876 x27 h4 y696 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">vation of the race that people learn to sustain life by eating, long </div><div class="t mbc1 x27 h4 y7e ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">before they are able to reason about it. When the plant is growing, </div><div class="t m6cc x27 h4 y3c4 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">we see evidences of life in it, although we cannot see the life. We </div><div class="t me1f x27 h4 yf1 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">see immense energy displayed by it. We see huge clods of earth </div><div class="t m6c3 x27 h4 y30b ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">pushed aside by it, and even stones are sometimes rent asunder by it. </div><div class="t m5d4 x27 h4 y5f4 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Whence come this life and power?—Through God&apos;s word, which </div><div class="t m222 x27 h4 y34 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">said, &quot; Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding sped, and the </div></div><div class="pi" data-data='{"ctm":[1.000000,0.000000,0.000000,1.000000,0.000000,0.000000]}'></div></div>
