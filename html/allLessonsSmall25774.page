Yes, he would let these Adventists use his school for evangelistic </div><div class="t m1636 x3e h27 y2a80 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">meetings. </div><div class="t m1acf x49 h16 y2a59 ff6 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">It will give me an opportunity to refute their beliefs, </div><div class="t m1d7f xba h27 y2a59 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Samson </div><div class="t m448 x3e h27 y2aad ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">thought. </div><div class="t m2d74 x48 h27 y228f ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Samson was proud of his school and his position as headmaster. He </div><div class="t m4cb x3e h27 y230a ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">had struggled to get an education during the difficult years of war in </div><div class="t m133f x3e h27 ya83 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">South Sudan. When he was in the third grade, the English-speaking </div><div class="t maf3 x3e h27 y11f4 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">school that he attended was forced to close because of the war. The </div><div class="t m1135 x3e h27 yda9 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">school did not reopen, so when Samson was 18, he traveled to Juba, the </div><div class="t mdbd x3e h27 ycfd ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">largest city in South Sudan, hoping to continue his education. But the </div><div class="t m1f99 x3e h27 y777 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">schools there also had been closed because of fighting. So Samson took </div><div class="t m321 x3e h27 ya40 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">work as a house boy while he waited to continue his education. </div><div class="t m1197 x73 h27 y13bc ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">When the schools in Juba finally reopened, Samson enrolled. But </div><div class="t m1058 x3e h27 y1231 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the Sudanese government now controlled the region, and classes were </div><div class="t m17a5 x3e h27 ya89 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">taught in Arabic. Samson had to start over in school. Twelve years later </div><div class="t m1aed x3e h27 y1262 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">he finally completed his studies and returned to his home area to teach </div><div class="t m2191 x3e h27 y741 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and eventually become headmaster of a school. </div><div class="t m5d6 x73 h27 yd1f ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">When in July 1996 some Adventist believers asked Samson permis-</div><div class="t m2051 x3e h27 y92c ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sion to use his school for evangelistic meetings, he agreed, not because </div><div class="t m7fc x16 h27 y3a1 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">he believed what they taught, but because he was confident that he </div><div class="t m1058 x3e h27 y8b8 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">could teach these Adventists a thing or two about religion. </div><div class="t m8d1 x73 h27 y113e ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Before the opening meeting, Samson got drunk on the local brew to </div><div class="t m1311 x16 h27 ycd7 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">bolster his courage. He arrived at the meeting, and the ushers offered </div><div class="t m778 x16 h27 yf06 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">him a seat on the front row and a Bible to use. When the preacher </div><div class="t m1bc5 x16 h27 ydfa ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">began talking about Jesus&apos; second coming, Samson sat spellbound. He </div><div class="t m138d x16 h27 y106d ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">had never heard anything like this! </div><div class="t m52 x73 h27 ybd8 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The pastor read from the book of Matthew, but Suleman had no idea </div><div class="t m1469 x16 h27 y12d6 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">where Matthew was.

After the meeting Samson wanted to take the Bible home </div><div class="t m997 x6a h27 y154b ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">with him, but the usher explained that he had </div><div class="t m769 x6a h27 y514 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to come to every meeting before he could </div><div class="t m610 x6a h27 y90d ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">receive his own Bible. Angry, Samson </div><div class="t m754 x6a h27 y1361 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">stomped away from the schoolhouse.
