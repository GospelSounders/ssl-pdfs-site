Some </div><div class="t mce2 x74 h27 y2cb3 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">years ago a group of young people wanted to witness to their age </div><div class="t mf43 x74 h27 y2cd0 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">group.

This then is how we know that we belong to the truth, and </div><div class="t m2b1 x61 h27 y1562 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">how we set our hearts at rest in His presence whenever our hearts </div><div class="t mea3 x61 h27 y197a ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">condemn us.

But, as when Jesus was faced with </div><div class="t m13ad x61 h27 y1328 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the woman taken in adultery, God says to us, &quot;Neither do I condemn </div><div class="t m770 x61 h27 y1549 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">you,&quot; with the added command, &quot;Do not sin again&quot; (John 8:11, RSV). </div><div class="t m775 x61 h27 y15e3 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">And should you feel worried about what you have done, and hesitant </div><div class="t m14d5 x61 h27 y127 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">even to mention this in prayer, remember that God knows everything, </div><div class="t md32 x61 h27 y173f ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and He is greater than our hearts.

To have our conscience shouting, </div><div class="t mced x74 h27 y7de ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Wrong! Guilty! Sinner!&quot; can be distressingly depressing. The prob-</div><div class="t mddc x61 h27 ye80 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">lem with the conscience is like that of pain nerves.
