I learned to fight, to trust no one, to rely only on </div><div class="t m15d x71 h28 y2c36 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">myself. The guerrillas carried on their hit-and-run warfare from </div><div class="t m1065 x71 h28 y2902 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">hiding places in the forested mountains of the central Philippines. </div><div class="t mcff x71 h28 y21c6 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Violence dominated our lives; killing had little meaning. Eventually </div><div class="t m15b8 x71 h28 y2251 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I became commander of the guerrillas in the National People&apos;s Army. </div><div class="t m119f x71 h28 y1e9d ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Religion had no part in my life.

Shoving a gun at the pastor, we ordered him to lead </div><div class="t m437 x71 h28 y1041 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the way, and the congregation followed. The people scattered like </div><div class="t m808 x71 h28 y11d7 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">bats as they stepped outside the church.

Her refusal </div><div class="t m1196 x71 h28 y902 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">irritated me, and I pointed the barrel of my gun at her chest.
