After a worship service on the beach, 30 pastors </div><div class="t mcf9 x4a h27 y234b ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">stood in the crashing waves of the Pacific Ocean and baptized </div><div class="t m5c9 x4a h27 y20ef ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">nearly 1,000 people. After the service a man gave his testimony. </div><div class="t m166 x29 h27 y853 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">His name is Baget. He is a member of the B&apos;Laan tribe, an animist </div><div class="t m1956 x4a h27 ye19 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">people living on the island of Mindanao. For years, he had robbed—</div><div class="t m5c2 x4a h27 y484 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and sometimes killed—his victims. He had earned a well-deserved </div><div class="t ma27 x4a h27 y776 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">reputation as a ruthless murderer, and was feared by the community. </div><div class="t m90 x29 h27 ydad ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">But one day a glorious being appeared to Baget. His face was </div><div class="t m30f x4a h27 y65d ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">kind, and shone like the sun. He told Baget, &quot;You must worship the </div><div class="t m310 x4a h27 yf6b ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">God of heaven on </div><div class="t m1c99 xa4 h16 yf6b ff6 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Sabado </div><div class="t mf23 x3a h27 yf6b ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">[Saturday], God&apos;s holy day.&quot; Then the </div><div class="t m713 x4a h27 y17e3 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">being was gone.

Then the local Adventist mission heard about the </div><div class="t m5b8 x14 h27 yaae ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">angel visits and sent a lay preacher to study with the people. As Baget </div><div class="t m400 x14 h27 yaf1 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and the villagers listened, they recognized that the lay preacher&apos;s </div><div class="t m413 x14 h27 y2e6 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">teachings were the same as the glorious visitor&apos;s. They welcomed the </div><div class="t m63c x14 h27 y572 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">lay preacher and joined his Bible studies. </div><div class="t m12e x36 h27 y6d3 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Following recent evangelistic meetings, Baget brought 25 of his </div><div class="t meda x87 h27 y9af ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">fellow B&apos;Laan people to the mass baptism </div><div class="t m1ee x87 h27 y251 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in the ocean to be baptized.
