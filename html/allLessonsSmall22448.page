He gives his background </div><div class="t mbe8 xbd h4c y29e5 ff4 fs19 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in just 13 words. He tells us that his father is Pethuel but gives no </div><div class="t m1bcc xbd h4c y2b82 ff4 fs19 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">clue as to what tribe he comes from. Neither does he list the kings </div><div class="t md0d xbd h4c y2a89 ff4 fs19 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">under whom he prophesied. Because he ministered in Judah and </div><div class="t m46d xbd h4c y28e4 ff4 fs19 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Jerusalem, it seems likely that he was a native of Judah. His name </div><div class="t m113a xbd h4c y234d ff4 fs19 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">means &quot;Yahweh is God.&quot; </div><div class="t m178f x16 h4c y17e8 ff4 fs19 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The time in which Joel wrote is debated by scholars. They have </div><div class="t m172c xbd h4c yef0 ff4 fs19 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">suggested dates ranging from the ninth century B.C. to the mid-fifth </div><div class="t m3ff xbd h4c y592 ff4 fs19 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">century B.C. John Calvin insightfully remarked that knowledge of </div><div class="t m20db xbd h4c y1493 ff4 fs19 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the exact time in which Joel wrote &quot;is of no great importance.&quot; Joel&apos;s </div><div class="t m389 x4 h4c y1398 ff4 fs19 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">message has timeless significance. If he wrote before the exile, the </div><div class="t m1730 xbd h4c yc8d ff4 fs19 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;day of the Lord&quot; could refer to the Babylonian invasions. If he wrote </div><div class="t m1084 xbd h4c ya38 ff4 fs19 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">after the exile, the &quot;day of the Lord&quot; could refer to the Greek or </div><div class="t m1839 x4 h4c ya2b ff4 fs19 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Roman attacks on Palestine. Whatever the historical context of his </div><div class="t m12b3 xbd h4c y11dd ff4 fs19 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">book, its end-time significance remains intact. </div><div class="t m1b00 x71 h4c y1a45 ff4 fs19 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Ellen G.
