It was the custom to bring these two offerings </div><div class="t m88a xbd h2d y1ed ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">together. Sin offerings atoned for specific sins, burnt offerings for general </div><div class="t m16 xbd h2d y1b1 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sinfulness. This can perhaps best be illustrated by what we do today. We may </div><div class="t m68e xbd h2d y14a ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">have done something wrong, and ask God to forgive us. In olden times this </div><div class="t maf9 xbd h2d yd1 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">would require a sin offering. After we have confessed our sin, we add to our </div><div class="t m846 xbd h2d y25e ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">prayer: &quot;And if there are other sins we do not know about, forgive these also.&quot; </div><div class="t mdb8 xbd h2d y281 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">This would have required a burnt offering. Hence, as stated above, sin offerings </div><div class="t ma31 xbd h2d y361 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">atoned for specific sins, burnt offerings for general sinfulness. </div><div class="t me4 x16 h2d y316 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">13. </div><div class="t ma73 x29 h2d y1868 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">On what occasions did Job offer burnt offerings?
