The apostle&apos;s use of the same word in connection </div><div class="t m7e4 x48 h2d y2e02 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">with the giving of prophecy suggests that the Holy Spirit came upon the </div><div class="t m9d4 x48 h2d y2bbd ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">prophets with a driving force, giving them their message from God that </div><div class="t m12d6 x48 h2d y2abf ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">they in turn felt impelled by a force outside themselves to pass on to their </div><div class="t m3e7 x48 h2d y2a5c ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">people. The entire final phrase of verse 21 might then be translated: &quot;To </div><div class="t m83b x48 h2d y2c64 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the contrary, impelled by the Holy Spirit men spoke from God.&quot; There is </div><div class="t m51f x48 h2d y28eb ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">no word &quot;holy&quot; attached to &quot;men&quot; in the original, and the words &quot;from </div><div class="t m9d x48 h2d y23b5 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">God&quot; refer not so much to the prophets as to the message that God gave </div><div class="t mdd5 x48 h2d y1584 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">them to share with His people. </div><div class="t md6 x36 h2d y4 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The same concluding phrase throws light on the way that inspiration </div><div class="t m17d x48 h2d y23d ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">worked on the prophet. The messenger believed himself to be God&apos;s in-</div><div class="t m1b9 x48 h2d y15ad ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">strument. He did not create the message; it was given him by God, and it </div><div class="t m1d4 x48 h2d y555 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was his mission to share it with those for whom the Lord intended it. But </div><div class="t m15f x48 h2d y15b6 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the prophet expressed that message in his own words, in language that </div><div class="t mb47 x48 h2d y348 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was best suited to his audience or readership. The message passed </div><div class="t m128 x48 h2d y4d3 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">through the mechanism of his own mind and personality and bore the </div><div class="t mce3 x48 h2d y3ed ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">impress of his own individuality. That process gives us the vastly differing </div><div class="t m87c x48 h2d y1b4 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">styles of Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Ezekiel, although each prophet delivered </div><div class="t mdd0 x48 h2d y15b7 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">messages that were given directly by the Holy Spirit. </div><div class="t m1160 x28 h6c y6e9 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">What additional light does Paul throw on the way inspiration works? </div><div class="t mf45 x48 h6c yac4 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">2 Tim. 3:16. </div><div class="t m48a x48 h6c ycf6 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ILLUMINATION: </div><div class="t mb12 x42 h2d y389 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;The union of the divine and human, manifest in </div><div class="t me47 x48 h2d ydeb ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Christ, exists also in the Bible.
