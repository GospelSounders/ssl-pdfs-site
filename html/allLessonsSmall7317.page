This was of far more consequence than the washing </div><div class="t m91b x3e he ycff ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of their dusty feet. With the spirit they then had, not one of them was pre-</div><div class="t ma63 x3e he y9ef ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">pared for communion with Christ. Until brought into a state of humility and </div><div class="t m115f x3e he y794 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">love, they were not prepared to partake of the paschal supper, or to share in </div><div class="t m1717 x3e he y73f ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the memorial service which Christ was about to institute. Their hearts must </div><div class="t m774 x3e he y1019 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">be cleansed. Pride and self-seeking create dissension and hatred, but all this </div><div class="t m158b x3e he y1529 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Jesus washed away in washing their feet. A change of feeling was brought </div><div class="t m1de x3e he y661 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">about. Looking upon them, Jesus could say, &apos;Ye are clean.&apos; Now there was </div><div class="t m29a x3e he y1027 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">union of heart, love for one another. They had become humble and teachable. </div><div class="t mb57 x3e he yff4 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Except Judas, each was ready to concede to another the highest place.
