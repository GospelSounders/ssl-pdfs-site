It also is sometimes assumed to be sharing with others the </div><div class="t m6e7 x29 h2d y2c4c ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">plan of salvation. But again, there is a difference between telling about </div><div class="t m889 x29 h2d y2bfc ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">how Jesus saves us, and letting others see what Jesus has done in us and </div><div class="t m16a x64 h2d y2baa ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">for us. We come back again to the fact that a witness is someone who </div><div class="t m391 x64 h2d y2a09 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">testifies about what he knows by personal observation and experience. In </div><div class="t m1de x64 h2d y2a13 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">his first epistle, John wrote: &quot;That which was from the beginning, which </div><div class="t m112a x64 h2d y23f3 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked </div><div class="t ma87 x29 h2d y23bc ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">upon, and our hands have handled, of the Word of life. . . . That which </div><div class="t m1cc x64 h2d y2311 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">we have seen and heard declare we unto you&quot; (1 John 1:1, 3). </div><div class="t m2e3 x61 h6c y736 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ILLUMINATION: </div><div class="t m44b x96 h2d yd1a ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;As witnesses for Christ, we are to tell what we know, </div><div class="t m304 x64 h2d y11f4 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">what we ourselves have seen and heard and felt.

We can tell how we have </div><div class="t m3d5 x64 h2d y123f ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tested His promise, and found the promise true. We can bear witness to </div><div class="t m36d x64 h2d ybfe ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">what we have known of the grace of Christ.

We learn how to be ready for tough questions in a Bible </div><div class="t mdc9 x61 h2d y1580 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">study. We learn how to overcome objections. We role-play knocking on </div><div class="t m74f x61 h2d y140d ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">doors. We memorize key texts and prophetic charts. Giving Bible stud-</div><div class="t m6e8 x61 h2d y939 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ies, going house-to-house, distributing literature—all of these things are </div><div class="t m430 x61 h2d ye36 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">important, needed, and vital. They are effective avenues of Christian ser-</div><div class="t m22f x64 h2d ye54 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">vice. But no matter how beautiful, needed, and truthful the theory of our </div><div class="t m422 x61 h2d y51b ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">faith is, the most effective way of witnessing is to share what we have </div><div class="t m7e7 x61 h2d y757 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">found in our personal experience with Jesus and have discovered for our-</div><div class="t mcf2 x61 h2d y1213 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">selves in His Word.
