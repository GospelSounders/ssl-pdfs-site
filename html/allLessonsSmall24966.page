As you read Matthew 18:23-35, try </div><div class="t m18c3 x4 h22 y2992 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to determine which verses fall into each act. Give a title to each act. </div><div class="t m301 x71 h22 y237f ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Act 1 </div><div class="t me08 x71 h22 y561 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Act 2 </div><div class="t m8d x71 h22 y1f46 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Act 3 </div><div class="t m7a3 x71 h22 yec1 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The king&apos;s behavior symbolizes the way God deals with us. </div><div class="t m616 xe h22 y144c ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Whom then does the king represent? </div><div class="t m2a0 x26 h28 yf8 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Just as the king pardoned his servant an enormous sum, so Christ </div><div class="t m711 xe h28 y9d8 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">pardons us of our sin. If not, we would be sold into the slavery of sin. </div><div class="t m9d x26 h28 y1524 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The servant pleaded for the king to have patience, promising that </div><div class="t m132f xe h28 y20a9 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">he would pay back his debt. But his debt was enormous. Most likely it </div><div class="t mce8 xe h28 y684 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was more than the total budget for the province in which he lived. In </div><div class="t m97 xe h28 y19d ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">other terms, it equaled 60 million working days! Obviously, the king </div><div class="t m100 xe h28 y8 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">knew there was no way the servant could repay him. Likewise, there is </div><div class="t m47f xe h28 y9b5 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">nothing we can do to pay the debt of sin we owe. But when we </div><div class="t mb49 xe h28 yf32 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sincerely repent, God frees us from that debt. </div><div class="t m30b x26 h22 y1cd7 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">What does the servant&apos;s behavior in Matthew 18:28-30 tell us about </div><div class="t m1894 x92 h22 y19f6 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the nature of his repentance? Compare his fellow servant&apos;s speech with </div><div class="t m3ff x92 h22 y24e ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the speech he himself had made to the king (verses 26, 29). </div><div class="t m7a3 x26 h28 y1a4e ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The second servant&apos;s debt was 100 denarii, which amounted to </div><div class="t m998 x92 h28 y1b71 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">only 100 days&apos; wages. Contrast that to the debt owed by the first </div><div class="t m23b x92 h28 y3ab ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">servant, and you can better understand how selfish the first servant </div><div class="t mb1e x92 h28 y14af ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was. He did not need the money to pay back his debt, for the king had </div><div class="t m2be x92 h28 yc83 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">pardoned it. Obviously he cared only for himself.
