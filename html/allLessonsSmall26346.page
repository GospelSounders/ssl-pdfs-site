But it was too dangerous for outsiders </div><div class="t mb8b x26 h28 y1e01 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to travel the roads around Samrong, where Samithy lived. Many </div><div class="t me81 x26 h28 y2073 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">unwary travelers had been killed by bandits or renegade soldiers. </div><div class="t mf6 x26 h28 y204f ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">In addition, it was the height of the rainy season, and the road was </div><div class="t m391 x26 h28 y7c6 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">often flooded, making travel nearly impossible. </div><div class="t m7db x64 h28 y154f ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">But the urgent plea for help came after Samithy encountered a </div><div class="t m2f9 x26 h28 y12ec ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">number of orphans as he visited people.
