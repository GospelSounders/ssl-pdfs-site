Some people have </div><div class="t m13d1 x4 h5f y854 ff4 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">said that it is supported on the back of a huge elephant, some that it is </div><div class="t m23bb x4 h5f yc39 ff4 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">supported on the shoulders of a giant. But Job declared that God has hung </div><div class="t mf4a xe h5f y8d3 ff4 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the earth out in space, supported by nothing. How then is the earth up-</div><div class="t m514 xe h5f y4fc ff4 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">held? The writer of the book of Hebrews says that it is upheld-by the word </div><div class="t m1fdb xe h5f ye84 ff4 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of God&apos;s power. Science now affirms that the earth has no material or </div><div class="t m2663 xe h5f y8d5 ff4 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">physical support. </div><div class="t m2b0f x71 h5f y13cd ff4 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">We often speak of &quot;gravitation&quot; as the force that holds the worlds in </div><div class="t m18a7 xe h5f y7cf ff4 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">order in their wondrous circuit through space. But we need to remember </div><div class="t m2ad5 xe h5f y53d ff4 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that gravitation is not a thing, but merely a convenient name for a way in </div><div class="t m12a1 xe h5f y768 ff4 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">which nature has been observed to act. This term really explains nothing. </div><div class="t m2b3b xe h5f y661 ff4 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">We have no scientific explanation of the cause of gravitation, or of any </div><div class="t m13a3 xe h5f yfbb ff4 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">other attractive forces, such as cohesion and adhesion. These &quot;forces&quot; are </div><div class="t m1e32 xe h5f y3d1 ff4 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">only names to express the way in which the great Jehovah has decreed that </div><div class="t m17d8 xe h5f ya12 ff4 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">matter should act. </div><div class="t m2661 x71 h5f y8b5 ff4 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;It is easy to explain any form of a push in a physical way ; but gravity </div><div class="t m109e xe h5f y599 ff4 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">is not a push but a pull. And how are we to explain the method by which </div><div class="t m2b5b xe h5f y76c ff4 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">a body can act where it is not, how explain in detail the way by which it </div><div class="t m2383 xe h5f yf88 ff4 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">can reach out and pull in toward itself another separated body, and exert </div><div class="t m985 xe h5f y439 ff4 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">this pull across the immeasurably wide fields of space? The law of inverse </div><div class="t m11f4 xe h5f ya69 ff4 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">squares may tell us very accurately the manner in which the results are </div><div class="t m2ba4 xe h5f yf89 ff4 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">accomplished, for our Creator is a God of order. But there is no material-</div><div class="t m1ed8 xe h5f yeca ff4 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">istic theory of the why of gravitation that is worth employing the time of </div><div class="t m173c xe h5f y471 ff4 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sensible, truth-loving people. And we can rest assured that there never will </div><div class="t m2945 xe h5f y8be ff4 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">be any such real explanation save that this is the way which the great </div><div class="t mc58 xe h5f y120d ff4 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Jehovah has ordained. Since such theories only explain the known in terms </div><div class="t m2b86 xe h5f y76e ff4 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of the unknown, they can serve only as a sort of mental buffer or shield </div><div class="t m2bc1 xe h5f y5d5 ff4 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">between us and the conception of the direct working of a personal God, </div><div class="t m2096 xe h5f yc3e ff4 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">whose word must always be as effective throughout the remotest corners of </div><div class="t m28f6 xe h5f y12e6 ff4 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">His universe as near at hand, for the very simple reason that matter has </div><div class="t m2b43 xe h5f y988 ff4 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">no &apos;properties&apos; which He has not imparted to it, and accordingly it can </div><div class="t m1ec0 xe h5f y7b8 ff4 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">have no innate inertia or reluctance to act which God&apos;s word would need </div><div class="t m2977 xe h5f y80c ff4 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to overcome in order to induce it to act, even when this word operates </div><div class="t m247d xe h5f y864 ff4 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">across the wide fields of space.
