Nebuchadnezzar </div><div class="t m674 x28 he y2fb9 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">must have been impressed greatly by the tree he saw in his dream. It was a tree </div><div class="t m915 x28 he y2f2c ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that brought benefits to many creatures. To cut it down was not only a tragedy to </div><div class="t mea3 x28 he y2ea5 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the tree, but a loss to the creatures who profited from its shade and branches. It is </div><div class="t m2f1 x28 he y29a4 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">no wonder that the king was troubled by the dream and wanted to know its; </div><div class="t md25 x28 he y29c0 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">interpretation. </div><div class="t m2c0 x6f h1 y2bec ff1 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">How did what happened to the tree concern the king, and who gave the </div><div class="t mec3 x28 h1 y2a72 ff1 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">verdict? Dan. 4: 13-17. </div><div class="t m56 x6f he y218f ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">What happened to the tree was of immense concern to the king. Evidently </div><div class="t m1184 x36 he y1fc2 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">some tragic event was to take place. But what was the meaning of the stump </div><div class="t m729 x36 he y1c83 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">being bound with iron and bronze? What did the &quot;seven times&quot; mean? Who are </div><div class="t mdd9 x36 he y16c6 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the &quot;watchers,&quot; the &quot;holy ones&quot;? He needed a clear interpretation. </div><div class="t m7db x34 h1 y17ac ff1 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">4. The Interpretation (Dan. 4:19-27). </div><div class="t m5c9 x34 he y1a0f ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The dream was not easy to interpret; not because of, its complexity but because </div><div class="t m1476 x36 he y1aaf ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of its obvious import. Somebody was going to be hurt, and the hurt would come </div><div class="t m1b2 x36 he y1f51 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">as the result of a decision made by an authority that could not be resisted. </div><div class="t ma20 x34 h1 y16ab ff1 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">How was Daniel affected as he contemplated the dream, and how did the </div><div class="t m754 x36 h1 y1672 ff1 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">king encourage him? Dan. 4:19. </div><div class="t m319 x34 he y1f69 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">It is not easy to tell a powerful king that he will lose his power. As is true of </div><div class="t mae x29 he y17b3 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">nearly everyone, kings like to hear good news, not bad. The good news was that </div><div class="t m2c1 x29 he y10df ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the marvelous tree represented Nebuchadnezzar himself. He was like a tall tree </div><div class="t m393 x29 he y1e7a ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that brought blessing to many. </div><div class="t me0d x34 he y1d4f ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The bad news was that he would lose his power, lose his mind, and live like an </div><div class="t m645 x29 he y1fa2 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">animal for seven years. But he would be restored to power when he came to the </div><div class="t m992 x29 he y1e1c ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">place where he would acknowledge that the God of heaven is in command of </div><div class="t m5c8 x29 he y1711 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">everyone and everything. (See Daniel 4:24-26.) </div><div class="t mb97 x34 he y1fb1 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Imagine how you would feel if you were King Nebuchadnezzar. Can you </div><div class="t m436 x29 he y138c ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">imagine how Daniel felt as he outlined the meaning of the dream to the King who </div><div class="t m28d x29 he y1d1d ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">had always been good to him, who had expressed such confidence in him? </div><div class="t m46a xc5 h1 y1568 ff1 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">What does the way in which Daniel concluded his interpretation teach us </div><div class="t m373 x29 h1 y1c89 ff1 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">about tactfulness? Dan. 4:27. </div><div class="t m5c7 xc5 he y17fc ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Daniel felt that he had to appeal to the king to renounce his sin, and do what </div><div class="t mdf7 x29 he y1d0b ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was right. There is only one attitude to take toward sin. That is to determine, by </div><div class="t m467 x29 he y1d60 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">God&apos;s grace, not to sin. To continue in sin is to court disaster. </div><div class="t mcc xc5 he yb51 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Up to this point we have not been told what the king&apos;s particular sin was. Later </div><div class="t m368 x29 he y1f29 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">it is revealed that he indulged in pride of achievement. Naturally, he did not </div><div class="t me59 x29 he y1e65 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">build Babylon with his own hands. Probably he used forced labor. It would be </div><div class="t m1db x29 he y14ce ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">expected in those days that his inspectors and supervisors would be cruel to the </div><div class="t mf1 x29 he y1a9e ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">laborers. Daniel suggested that the king change his policies and be kind to the </div><div class="t m7ef x29 he y17c5 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">oppressed. If he did this, there was a chance that he would continue to be blessed </div><div class="t m857 x64 he y1cac ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of God and be prosperous. </div><div class="t m98c x64 h1 y1e00 ff1 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">40 </div></div><div class="pi" data-data='{"ctm":[1.000000,0.000000,0.000000,1.000000,0.000000,0.000000]}'></div></div>
