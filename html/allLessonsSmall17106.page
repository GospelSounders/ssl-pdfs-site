Some Christians frequently speak of the Father and the Son, but </div><div class="t m263 xda h35 y22f7 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">seldom of the Holy Spirit. We pray to the Father in the name of the Son, but seem to </div><div class="t m769 xda h35 y1f35 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">forget that it is the Holy Spirit that intercedes for us with &quot;groanings which cannot be </div><div class="t m7e2 xda h35 y2355 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">uttered.&quot; </div><div class="t m31f x4 h35 y15c9 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">One additional factor makes it imperative that we study about the Spirit at this time. </div><div class="t m2a4 xda h35 y162d ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Other Christians speak much about the Spirit today. There is a current interest in </div><div class="t m411 xda h35 y1511 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">charismatics or the spectacular gifts of the Spirit. But talk about, and an alleged </div><div class="t m1ea xda h35 yf1d ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">devotion to, the Spirit do not necessarily imply that obedience or homage is rendered </div><div class="t m1105 xda h35 y1b5c ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to the Spirit, or that we are really acquainted with Him as He speaks to us through the </div><div class="t m47 xda h35 y1731 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Scriptures. </div><div class="t m41b x4 h35 y1f08 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The study of the Spirit is of highest importance. Our eternal salvation is closely </div><div class="t me9a xda h35 y10b9 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">related to an experimental knowledge or a close personal acquaintance with and </div><div class="t m600 xda h35 y630 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">obedience to the biddings of the Spirit. </div><div class="t m166f x4 h35 y1087 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The Bible mentions the Holy Spirit more than 300 times—over 100 times in the Old </div><div class="t m13e4 xda h35 y1439 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Testament and over 200 times in the New Testament. It was the Spirit who inspired the </div><div class="t m2f9 xda h35 y10c9 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">writers of the Scriptures. (See 2 Peter 1:21.) When the Spirit speaks today, He will </div><div class="t mec3 xda h35 y1529 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">therefore of necessity speak in accordance with His own inspired messages given </div><div class="t m220 xda h35 ye9e ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">through the prophets and apostles of the past; anything not in conformity with the </div><div class="t macf xda h35 y1f49 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">historical revelation, namely the Bible, must therefore obviously emanate from some </div><div class="t m60e xda h35 y10d8 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">other source or some other spirit than God&apos;s Spirit. </div><div class="t me3a x4 h35 y1337 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">These lessons will present the biblical picture of the Spirit. But the emphasis will </div><div class="t m1d4 xda h35 yf2f ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">not be placed on doctrine per se. It is all too possible for us to count the beads of </div><div class="t mda9 xda h35 y12a1 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">systematic theology without ever receiving the breath of life. Because of this we will </div><div class="t m40a xc4 h35 y840 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">here attempt to present the Spirit as God&apos;s regenerating agent who alone can breathe </div><div class="t m56b xc4 h35 y1d88 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">upon us the vivifying breath of God. It is this kind of experience that prevents us from </div><div class="t m2b0 xc4 h35 y10ed ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">suffocating under the presentation of dogmatic truth. This revival experience is </div><div class="t m4ce xc4 h35 y1bcf ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">especially important for the church today, since &quot;the dispensation in which we are </div><div class="t m1118 xc4 h35 y1141 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">now living is to be, to those that ask, the dispensation of the Holy Spirit.&quot;—</div><div class="t m42d xda h35 y1245 ff5 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Testimonies to Ministers, </div><div class="t mced x5e h35 y13ff ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">p. 511. </div><div class="t m8bd xe h35 y145b ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Therefore, the ultimate purpose of this quarter&apos;s study is to bring every student into </div><div class="t m1f7 xc4 h35 y1540 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">a right relationship to the Holy Spirit in order that He may be a mighty vivifying power </div><div class="t m443 xc4 h35 y1db5 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in our lives. </div><div class="t m248 xe h35 y1cbb ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Please note also that it is only through the Spirit that we can hold personal </div><div class="t maf6 xc4 h35 yd7d ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">communion with God. As the divine revelation, the Bible, was given through the </div><div class="t m883 xc4 h35 y118b ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Spirit, so it can only be understood through the personal illumination of the Spirit. </div><div class="t m93 xe h35 yf48 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">As a people, Seventh-day Adventists should be most interested in studying about </div><div class="t m270 xc4 h35 y1dff ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and becoming personally acquainted with the Spirit. We do not believe only in </div><div class="t m364 xc4 h35 y11e6 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Christ&apos;s death for our sins, but also in His ongoing intercession for us in the heavenly </div><div class="t m1372 xc4 h35 y1373 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sanctuary; and only the Spirit can apply the results of that intercession to our lives in </div><div class="t m87c x0 h35 y1342 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">anticipation of Christ&apos;s return in glory. </div><div class="t m191a xe h35 yb89 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The Spirit is God&apos;s means of reaching men in sin. His workings or movements are as </div><div class="t m136b x0 h35 y1d76 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">unchartable as the path of the wind. But in mysterious ways He touches men, even </div><div class="t m25 x0 h35 yde6 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">those steeped in sin like the persecutor Saul on the Damascus road. In the same way </div><div class="t maa3 x0 h35 y1061 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that Saul the persecutor became Paul the committed apostle, many other dramatic </div><div class="t md0e x0 h35 y1199 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">changes have been witnessed in the lives of the vilest of sinners. For instance, the </div><div class="t m66e x0 h35 y1dc8 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">prevaricating, swindling, and profligate divinity student George Muller became a </div><div class="t m1d4 x0 h35 y11ca ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">great man of faith, the noted orphanage operator of Bristol fame. </div><div class="t m9c2 x92 h35 y14fe ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">There is hope of salvation for even the worst sinner as long as he does not steel his </div><div class="t m13ad x0 h35 y1559 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">heart against the Spirit&apos;s pleadings. Certainly this same Holy Spirit can bring new life </div><div class="t mb7c x0 h35 y1070 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and power into the Adventist Church du ring&apos;this quarter as we open our hearts to His </div><div class="t m111e x0 h35 y21a7 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">influence. </div></div><div class="pi" data-data='{"ctm":[1.000000,0.000000,0.000000,1.000000,0.000000,0.000000]}'></div></div>
