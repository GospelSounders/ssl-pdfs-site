Their self-</div><div class="t m1a8b x26 h2b ya8 ff4 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ish spirit filled Him with sorrow, but He entered into no controversy </div><div class="t m2d0 x26 h2b ycf ff4 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">with them regarding their difficulty. Instead He gave them an example </div><div class="t m9c8 x26 h2b y8f5 ff4 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">they would never forget. His love for them was not easily disturbed or </div><div class="t mdb1 x26 h2b y280 ff4 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">quenched. He knew that the Father had given all things into His hands, </div><div class="t m878 x71 h2b y1ba4 ff4 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and that He came from God, and went to God. He had a full conscious-</div><div class="t mda4 x26 h2b y1f1 ff4 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ness of His divinity; but He had laid aside His royal crown and kingly </div><div class="t m1054 x26 h2b y50 ff4 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">robes, and had taken the form of a servant. One of the last acts of His </div><div class="t m150 x26 h2b y1cc ff4 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">life on earth was to gird Himself as a servant, and perform a servant&apos;s </div><div class="t m1745 x26 h2b yf8 ff4 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">part.&quot;—Id., pp. 644, 645. </div><div class="t m16f x64 h2b ycc7 ff4 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">7. </div><div class="t m74d xc h2b ycc7 ff4 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">What question did Peter ask the Master?

Verses 10, 11. </div><div class="t m49d x61 h2b y91b ff4 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">NOTE.—&quot;These words mean more than bodily cleanliness.

He who </div><div class="t m2ac x71 h2b y95 ff4 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">came from the bath was clean, but the sandaled feet soon became dusty, </div><div class="t m10ef x71 h2b y1db ff4 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and again needed to be washed. So Peter and his brethren had been </div><div class="t m1622 x71 h2b y43f ff4 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">washed in the great fountain opened for sin and uncleanness.
