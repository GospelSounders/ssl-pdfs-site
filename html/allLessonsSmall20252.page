Not long before Peter had declared, </div><div class="t m572 x71 h28 y28a2 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Though all men shall be offended because of thee, yet will I never be </div><div class="t m68c x71 h28 y23e6 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">offended&quot; (Matt. 26:33).

Again Peter&apos;s re-</div><div class="t mf32 x71 h28 y315 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sponse was genuine and free of pride. Christ&apos;s commission to Peter then </div><div class="t m165e x26 h28 y13df ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">became, &quot;Feed my sheep&quot; (verse 16). </div><div class="t m645 x73 h28 y1b5 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">One last time Jesus put His question to Peter.
