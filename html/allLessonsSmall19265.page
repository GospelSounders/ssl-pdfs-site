If Jonah had purposely hidden away in </div><div class="t mf42 x6f h28 y231b ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the hold, he was now brought to full view. Prodded with questions as to </div><div class="t m1359 x6f h28 y1fb8 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">origin, occupation, and purpose of journey, he told all.

His willingness to make amends heightened their respect for </div><div class="t mf6b x6f h28 y143b ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">him and his God.
