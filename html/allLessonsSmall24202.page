One day as she prayed for guidance, a </div><div class="t m5cb xc5 h22 y2389 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">knock at the door interrupted her prayer.

Mrs. Chung attended their church, but </div><div class="t ma84 xc5 h22 y11d1 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">hesitated to join the Adventist Church. </div><div class="t m15b8 x49 h22 y1acb ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">However, she felt no peace; her life seemed empty and mean-</div><div class="t m7fa xc5 h22 yf91 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ingless.

At dawn she went to the Adventist church to pray. There she </div><div class="t m192c x34 h22 y19d0 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">found assurance that God had accepted her. She began attending </div><div class="t mb94 x34 h22 y10c1 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the Adventist church regularly, and was baptized in May 1993. </div><div class="t m38a x59 h22 y16ad ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Her one goal became to share Jesus with others. She started </div><div class="t m6f7 x34 h22 y1395 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">giving Bible studies to a neighbor couple.
