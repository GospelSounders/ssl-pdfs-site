H. Zachary </div><div class="t m386 x73 h27 y2981 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Jardslaw Wajik, a popular rock band musician in Poland had </div><div class="t m8b1 x16 h27 y293d ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">everything he wanted. Everything but peace. He had grown up attend-</div><div class="t m1bbe x71 h27 y2b40 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ing church, but his life had become a tangled nightmare of tobacco, </div><div class="t m2fe6 x16 h27 y28ce ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">drugs, alcohol, and sinful living. He knew that his lifestyle was killing </div><div class="t m7bc x71 h27 y2273 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">him. Depression set in, and one night he sat on a street curb and cried. </div><div class="t mb32 x74 h27 ydd2 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">He was admitted to a mental hospital, and slowly his life began to </div><div class="t mf0b x16 h27 y9cc ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">change. Following his release, he married a former Adventist woman </div><div class="t m634 x16 h27 y149c ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">who helped him recover his health. His music career soared, and his </div><div class="t m1f74 x71 h27 y976 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">records reached the top of the charts. In spite of success and financial </div><div class="t m19d3 x71 h27 y9b0 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">security, Wajik still felt lonely. </div><div class="t m1cf7 x74 h27 y1cb4 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">When one of his band members announced that he intended to stop </div><div class="t m13b4 x71 h27 y1353 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">smoking, Wajik, who smoked 70 cigarettes a day, replied, &quot;If you are </div><div class="t mdf5 x71 h27 y1e8e ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">still clean in two weeks, I will stop smoking too.&quot; Two weeks later </div><div class="t ma27 x71 h27 y1c29 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Wajik knew he must keep that promise. He asked God to take away </div><div class="t m574 x71 h27 y1e15 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">his hunger for liquor and tobacco. God came close to him and an-</div><div class="t m1ba2 x71 h27 y10ce ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">swered his prayer. </div><div class="t me2c x74 h27 y11e0 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Then one day Wajik&apos;s wife announced that she had been rebap-</div><div class="t m14d1 x71 h27 yf2b ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tized. She wanted a new life for herself and their daughter. Wajik did </div><div class="t m7bc x71 h27 y637 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">not object. One day he picked up a Bible and, in his words, &quot;The Lord </div><div class="t mb55 x71 h27 y14d7 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">opened it to Exodus 20.&quot; He read the Sabbath commandment and </div><div class="t m463 x71 h27 y1f63 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">realized that the church of his childhood was not following all the </div><div class="t m1ff3 x71 h27 y1d29 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">commandments. He stopped performing in rock concerts on Sabbath. </div><div class="t m5c2 x74 h27 y1cd2 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">He attended Adventist evangelistic meetings but did not take a </div><div class="t m30e x71 h27 yea6 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">stand for God. Several months later at a youth camp meeting Wajik </div><div class="t m123c x71 h27 y19d4 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">felt the Holy Spirit touch his heart. He gave his heart totally to God. At </div><div class="t m204d x71 h27 y10f7 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">his baptism Wajik testified that &quot;My old life was buried in the water, </div><div class="t m629 x71 h27 yece ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and Jesus has given me a new life. I am still a sinner, but I have a </div><div class="t m1122 x71 h27 yd40 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">wonderful Friend, Jesus Christ.&quot; </div><div class="t m1c9c x74 h27 y934 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">God impressed him that he needed to use his influence and popu-</div><div class="t m1500 x71 h27 y145d ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">larity to help others. He dropped out of his band and set his heart on </div><div class="t m634 x71 h27 y1ec5 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">three objectives. He wanted to have a relationship with God, a God-</div><div class="t me6c x71 h27 y1ce7 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">honoring family, and to be involved in some exemplary type of work. </div><div class="t m2318 x71 h27 y1cd5 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">He had no idea how hard that would be. </div><div class="t m768 x61 h27 y18e5 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Wajik began writing songs for a new musical group. He wants to </div><div class="t m1d9d x71 h27 y1521 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">show people the way out of sin, the way to joy and hope. He prays that </div><div class="t m222e x71 h27 yf50 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the thousands who purchased his earlier albums will purchase the new </div><div class="t m1ae5 x71 h27 yfd6 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">one and find in it the joy that Wajik has found in his new life in Christ. </div><div class="t m761 x61 h6c y1db7 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">J.
