Then he told them of his decision to be baptized </div><div class="t m324 x71 h27 y1531 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">as a Seventh-day Adventist. His mother had heard that some reli-</div><div class="t m14a1 x71 h27 y50d ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">gious sects were kidnapping and brainwashing young people.
