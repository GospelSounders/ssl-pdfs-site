(See 1 Cor. 12:31.) Refer to the chart under section II of the </div><div class="t ma20 x73 h2d y2cfa ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">lesson to review the way Paul ranks the gifts. One reason why he does so is </div><div class="t m3da x73 h2d y2aa8 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to demonstrate that the tongues phenomenon that was taking place in the </div><div class="t m7f2 x73 h2d y29ed ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Corinthian church should not be given undue importance.

He then explains in 1 Corinthians 13 that none of the gifts </div><div class="t m1226 x73 h2d y21f9 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">have real value unless they are combined with the gift of love. That Paul is </div><div class="t m1347 x73 h2d y1f53 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">not referring to sentimental or natural human love becomes quite clear in his </div><div class="t m580 x73 h2d y997 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">development of chapter 13. </div><div class="t m5a0 x73 h6c y18d8 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">COMPARE Paul&apos;s lists of what love is and what it is not in 1 Corinthi-</div><div class="t me71 x73 h6c y18ea ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ans 13 in order to understand more fully the kind of love about which he </div><div class="t m915 x73 h6c y1bc5 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">is talking.
