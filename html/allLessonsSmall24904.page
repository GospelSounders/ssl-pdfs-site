A man, Joao, his wife, Lucilene, and four small children </div><div class="t m1ac2 x26 h27 y2a53 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">lived in a scene of intense poverty, hunger, and filth. I wondered how </div><div class="t me4b x26 h27 y28fd ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the family could focus on studying the Bible when their material </div><div class="t m1636 x26 h27 y210b ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">needs were so great, but Joao eagerly told me about a dream he had. </div><div class="t mccd x26 h27 y874 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;I was going to a dance, but I came to a crossroad, and </div><div class="t m2d99 xb2 h87 y874 ff1 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I </div><div class="t m18b7 x81 h27 y874 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">did not know </div><div class="t m677 x26 h27 y51d ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">which way to go. A man dressed in white with a Bible in his hand </div><div class="t m176e x26 h27 y3c7 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">stood beside me. I asked him for directions, and he opened the Bible </div><div class="t m1485 x26 h27 y1a88 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and said: &apos;The way is this one.&apos; &quot; Then Joao added, &quot;God has brought </div><div class="t m17f1 x26 h27 y18bf ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">you here. Yes, we want to study the Bible.&quot; </div><div class="t m55f x64 h27 y1825 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I went to visit the family several Sabbaths in a row but did not </div><div class="t m758 x18 h27 y131d ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">find them home. Then I learned that they had moved. I located </div><div class="t m5b0 x26 h27 yec3 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">them living in a hut made of dirty planks under a tree infested </div><div class="t m31d x26 h27 y10bd ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">with ants. Their month-old baby&apos;s body was covered with ant </div><div class="t m55f x18 h27 y1753 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">bites. Because of their need, some church members and I began a </div><div class="t m316 x18 h27 y198 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Branch Sabbath School there. We taught hygiene and health, and </div><div class="t m1b2 x18 h27 y1529 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">slowly we were able to change these people&apos;s habits. Commu-</div><div class="t m354 x18 h27 yd3a ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">nity Services helped with clothing and shoes, and soon Joao and </div><div class="t m1d7 x18 h27 y1176 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Lucilene asked for baptism. But Lucilene was a minor, and they </div><div class="t m1084 x18 h27 y1996 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">had not been married, so they had to wait for baptism. </div><div class="t m7e9 x64 h27 yb11 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">One day Joao called me, very upset. I went to see them and </div><div class="t m42c x18 h27 y12bc ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">found that Lucilene had been beaten by the neighbors. Joao was </div><div class="t m10fe x18 h27 ybd5 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">so angry he wanted to kill the offenders.

Do not be </div><div class="t m1b2 x18 h27 y452 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.&quot; Slowly Joao </div><div class="t maa7 x18 h27 y14e4 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">calmed down. </div><div class="t m1499 x29 h27 y14ca ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">We prayed and asked God to help them find another home. </div><div class="t m1154 x4a h27 ye7 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">When I returned home, I met a friend who needed someone to </div><div class="t m1761 x4a h27 y601 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">live on an unoccupied ranch he owned.
