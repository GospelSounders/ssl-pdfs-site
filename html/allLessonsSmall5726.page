Their lives are stained by selfishness and </div><div class="t m171 xe h4 y32e ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">avarice, yet they throw over it all a garment of seeming purity, and </div><div class="t m659 x92 h4 y3e8 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">thus for a time deceive their fellow men. But they can not deceive </div><div class="t m103b x92 h4 y2095 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">God.

He saw infinitely more </div><div class="t m7b6 x92 h4 y5ce ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">than all this. He accurately balanced the gift with the circumstances </div><div class="t m97a xe h4 y620 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of the giver. The value in His sight was not altogether measured </div><div class="t m118b x92 h4 y195 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">by the amount cast in. Jesus looked into the hearts of the givers, </div><div class="t m119d xe h4 y4fd ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and beheld the motives prompting the gifts. This &quot;how&quot; the givers </div><div class="t m895 x92 h4 y1868 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">gave, above all else made the offering either of little value or precious </div><div class="t m1010 x92 h4 y2b5 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in the eyes of the Master.
