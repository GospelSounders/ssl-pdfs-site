THE NEXT OF KIN (Ruth 4:3, 4). </div><div class="t m164d x34 h6c y2a35 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">What did Boaz tell the nearer kinsman? Why do you suppose that he </div><div class="t m267 x29 h6c y2ab4 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">did not present the entire story? </div><div class="t m6e0 x34 h2d y2304 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">There are many details in this account that puzzle us today, although they </div><div class="t mdf7 x29 h2d y1ea3 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">must have been plain to the book&apos;s readers when it first was written. We do </div><div class="t m3f2 x29 h2d y1e4b ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">not know why the nearer kinsman is not named. Some have suggested that </div><div class="t m487 x29 h2d y1ba9 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">this was done to spare the man and his descendants embarrassment. Others </div><div class="t mcd3 x29 h2d y1e4d ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">have concluded that not naming him was a literary device intended to show </div><div class="t mb34 x29 h2d y166f ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that his name was unimportant to the message of the story. Nor do we under-</div><div class="t m368 x29 h2d y1c46 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">stand fully how Naomi could offer the land for sale because normally, a </div><div class="t m31b x29 h2d y1ace ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">widow did not inherit her husband&apos;s land.

The basic principle is laid down in these words: &apos;The land shall not </div><div class="t m27f x64 h2d y1bdc ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">be sold for ever: for the land is mine; for ye are strangers and sojourners with </div><div class="t m388 x64 h2d y1b77 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">me.
