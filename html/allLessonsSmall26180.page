For several weeks warriors </div><div class="t m14d1 x71 h27 y2be4 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">from two neighboring villages had terrorized the community, burning </div><div class="t mafc x71 h27 y228a ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">houses, slaughtering animals, and destroying crops. Several people </div><div class="t mcdd x71 h27 y20e6 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">had been killed. Laiagam was located between the two warring </div><div class="t mcbc x71 h27 y20f2 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tribes. Burning arrows, aimed at the fighting villages, sometimes </div><div class="t m1857 x26 h27 yda8 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">fell in Laiagam, destroying several homes. The villagers feared for </div><div class="t m1138 x71 h27 yf1c ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">their lives. </div><div class="t m7e8 x61 h27 yec0 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">A little Adventist church stood amidst the carnage in Laiagam. </div><div class="t ma2b x26 h27 yccf ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The little group of believers met at their beloved church to decide </div><div class="t md31 x26 h27 y6cb ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">what to do. They agreed that it would be best if they left the village </div><div class="t m257 x26 h27 ya0e ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">until the fighting ended. As they left their little church, they felt </div><div class="t m760 x26 h27 y128b ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that this would be the last time they would see it standing. How-</div><div class="t m57f x26 h27 yddc ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ever, one young member decided to stay in the village and watch </div><div class="t m1377 x26 h27 yeda ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">over the church. </div><div class="t m6e x61 h27 yec5 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Shortly after the believers left, Alo, the young man, heard the </div><div class="t m53c x26 h27 y92a ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sounds of an advancing war party. He could see the glow of their </div><div class="t m771 x26 h27 y2031 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">lighted torches as they neared the church. He knew that within </div><div class="t m250 x26 h27 ye30 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">minutes the church would be burned to the ground. </div><div class="t m639 x64 h27 y821 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Alo fell to his knees, praying for God&apos;s help. &quot;Lord, help me do </div><div class="t m77e x26 h27 y7f6 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">what I can to save this church.&quot; Quickly he picked up a piece of </div><div class="t m4f x26 h27 yd59 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">plastic pipe with a funnel attached to one end. The believers used </div><div class="t m1c99 x26 h27 y1075 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">this homemade trumpet to call worshipers to church. He blew into </div><div class="t mea5 x26 h27 yff8 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the trumpet, which made a loud blast, and again asked God for </div><div class="t m458 x26 h27 yd77 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">help. By now the mob had advanced to a few meters from the </div><div class="t m770 x26 h27 yf3b ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">church. Then they stopped. </div><div class="t m883 x64 h27 yade ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The sky seemed to darken as a huge cloud of bees swarmed </div><div class="t me3b x26 h27 y10ac ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">over the warriors and attacked them.
