Ps. 33:6. </div><div class="t m1870 x27 h87 y2bff ff1 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">What does this tell us about Him? </div><div class="t mb4b x14 h27 y1fe5 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The truth stated in Psalm 33:6 is one of the most simple and yet </div><div class="t m55b x27 h27 y3c6 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">profound statements about God and His power in the Scriptures. We </div><div class="t m1f7 x27 h27 y149c ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">see this divine process in operation, without explanation, in Genesis, </div><div class="t m685 x27 h27 y833 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">chapter 1. Each of the first days is introduced by the expression &quot;And </div><div class="t mb03 x27 h27 y978 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">God said . . .&quot; </div><div class="t m27f x14 h87 y73c ff1 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">What material did God use when He </div><div class="t m45c xab h27 y73c ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">created the universe, this </div><div class="t mdb8 x27 h87 ye0a ff1 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">world, humankind? Heb. 11:3. </div><div class="t ma27 x14 h27 y83b ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The account of the creation of the first humans in Genesis 2:7, 20-22 </div><div class="t m7ec x27 h27 ya8c ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">clearly depicts God making Adam from clay; Eve, in turn, was created </div><div class="t m8bd x11 h27 yf2a ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">from Adam&apos;s rib. In these cases, God did use matter that was already </div><div class="t m1062 x11 h27 y744 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in existence. However, the question remains: Where did that matter, </div><div class="t m468 x27 h27 y106b ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the clay, for example, ultimately come from? According to Hebrews </div><div class="t m406 x11 h27 y92f ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">11:3, we understand by faith &quot;that the universe was formed at God&apos;s </div><div class="t m72c x11 h27 yc55 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">command, so that what is seen was not made out of what was </div><div class="t mafc x11 h27 y809 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">visible&quot;(NIV). This was the best way that the author of Hebrews could </div><div class="t m678 x11 h27 y747 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">say that God made the universe out of nothing. Scholars describe this </div><div class="t mebe x11 h27 y1244 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">type of creation, of making something out of nothing by divine fiat (a </div><div class="t m464 x11 h27 yfc1 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">command that creates something), as </div><div class="t m43a x21 h16 y986 ff6 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ex nihilo </div><div class="t m43e xc9 h27 y986 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">(&quot;out of nothing&quot;) </div><div class="t m55b x11 h27 yf40 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">creation. What the Bible is teaching here is that ultimately all matter </div><div class="t m7f2 x11 h27 y7db ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in the universe was created by God. Conversely, the Bible is saying </div><div class="t m105 x11 h27 ye7e ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that God preceded everything else in the universe, including matter </div><div class="t m7f1 x11 h27 yf44 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and energy, that He is eternal and the eternal Originator of everything. </div><div class="t m15b0 x5d h27 yd7e ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">In this one simple statement the author of Hebrews staked out God&apos;s </div><div class="t m117a x11 h27 y8c5 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">claim as the only true God of the universe. He has no rivals or peers, </div><div class="t m311 x11 h27 y517 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">either animate or inanimate. Another way of making this point, which </div><div class="t m778 x11 h27 y1223 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was particularly significant in biblical times (but no less so today), is </div><div class="t m113a x11 h27 y7e3 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that there are no other gods but the Lord (1 Chron. 16:24-27; Ps. 96:5, 6; </div><div class="t m1bb8 x11 h27 y12dc ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Isa. 40:18-26; 42:5-9; 44). </div><div class="t m5b9 x74 h87 y9c6 ff1 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Think it through: God did not simply create this world or </div><div class="t md27 x71 h87 y1213 ff1 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">wind it up like a clock and then abandon it. God is not an aloof </div><div class="t m42c x71 h87 yabf ff1 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">deity who has turned His back on His creation, leaving them to </div><div class="t m59d x71 h87 y11ff ff1 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">their own devices. He continues &quot;upholding all things by the </div><div class="t m1160 x71 h87 y995 ff1 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">word of His power&quot; (Heb. 1:3, NKJV). Let us praise Him now </div><div class="t m460 x71 h87 y14a6 ff1 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">for every breath we take and every pulsation of the heart. </div><div class="t mcae xeb h27 y2deb ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">89 </div></div><div class="pi" data-data='{"ctm":[1.000000,0.000000,0.000000,1.000000,0.000000,0.000000]}'></div></div>
