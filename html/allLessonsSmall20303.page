What is true for the father of the race is </div><div class="t me3e x28 h2d y2efc ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">true for all its members. Our fate, our destiny, is included in his. So Paul </div><div class="t ma x28 h2d y2a39 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tells us that when one man (Adam) sinned and brought death into the </div><div class="t m1cf x28 h2d y2b31 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">world, that death &quot;passed upon all men&quot; (Rom. 5:12). </div><div class="t m220 x6f h2d y2b32 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Sometimes when the first mountain climber on a rope falls, the climber </div><div class="t m47 x28 h2d y2978 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">takes the others tied to the rope down with him. When Adam fell, he took </div><div class="t m642 x28 h2d y29a3 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">us down with him. All of us came under the power of death when Adam </div><div class="t m771 x28 h2d y210a ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">did. When he died, he was a prisoner of the grave. He was locked in. And </div><div class="t ma5 x28 h2d y2217 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">when we die, so are we. Adam had no key to unlock his own grave. </div><div class="t mcdd x28 h2d y210e ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Somewhere it holds him still. </div><div class="t m4ce x6f h2d y204d ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">We might well abandon hope and embrace despair if it were not for the </div><div class="t m1f2 x28 h2d y1c83 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">thrilling news that God shares with us in His Word. Adam </div><div class="t m86f xe1 h69 y6dd ff5 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">did </div><div class="t m396 xe2 h2d y6dd ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sin.

But God has sent a second Adam to </div><div class="t md5 x28 h2d yca7 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">attempt success where the first Adam failed. The second Adam gloriously </div><div class="t m7c0 x36 h2d y13d4 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">succeeded! </div><div class="t m695 x6f h2d y10b6 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">And now God gives each of us a choice.

Whatever goes for Him </div><div class="t m319 x36 h2d y10c8 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">goes for us. Our fate, our destiny, is included in His. &quot;As in Adam all die, </div><div class="t mf2f x28 h2d y1cdf ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">even so in Christ shall all be made alive&quot; (1 Cor. 15:22). </div><div class="t m772 x6f h2d yd3a ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">When Jesus stepped forth from His tomb in dazzling glory that long-</div><div class="t m889 x36 h2d y10d6 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ago Sunday morning, He did so as the new head of the human race. The </div><div class="t m6dd x28 h2d y1f38 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">first Adam was taken prisoner by death. The second Adam defeated </div><div class="t m1372 x28 h2d ydcc ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">death decisively. </div><div class="t m48d x6f h2d y10e4 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Therefore, if the head of the race has broken the power of death, the </div><div class="t m7fe x28 h2d y1df3 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">grave no longer has power to imprison forever the individual members of </div><div class="t m611 x28 h2d y1075 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that race. Death is reduced to locking up its prisoners for a time until </div><div class="t m754 x28 h2d y1d9a ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Jesus comes to set them free.
