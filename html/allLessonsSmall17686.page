In book study the </div><div class="t md1a xd0 h35 y1b58 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">student concentrates on a particular book to discover what God is trying to teach in </div><div class="t mcbc xd0 h35 y214a ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that book. There is a reason God guided the church in including in the canon each of </div><div class="t m2ff xd0 h35 y1510 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the 66 books that are in the Bible, and this reason needs to be discovered. </div><div class="t m6a xda h35 y219b ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">In true book study the student does not begin with a particular topic and then study </div><div class="t m5a0 xd0 h35 y1b5b ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">what the book says about that topic. He carefully examines chapter after chapter to </div><div class="t m1a11 xd0 h35 y1baa ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">understand the basic theme that the inspired author has developed. This is called the </div><div class="t m1cd xd0 h35 y1c08 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">inductive method of Bible study. It is one of the most fruitful methods of study </div><div class="t ma22 xd0 h35 y1799 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">because it examines all that is said in a particular book, and every part is examined in </div><div class="t m767 xd0 h35 y1e71 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the context of the whole. </div><div class="t m837 xda h35 y16e2 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">In our study of the book of Romans we will have to pass over rapidly certain </div><div class="t m107d xd0 h35 y18c1 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sections of the book, because one quarter is too brief a time to study all the book&apos;s </div><div class="t mb1e xd0 h35 y10c8 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">details. Despite this restriction, every effort has been made to present God&apos;s basic </div><div class="t m1355 xd0 h35 y17b1 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">message in the book. Students who have the time and the inclination can undertake a </div><div class="t m4d5 xd0 h35 y10d1 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">more thorough study. They will be richly rewarded. The fact that we named the </div><div class="t mb5a xd0 h35 y164f ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">lessons &quot;Redemption in Romans&quot; is not intended to restrict the inductive study of the </div><div class="t m328 xd0 h35 y1c09 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">book in any way. </div><div class="t m1ea xc4 h35 y1af4 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">There is one rule of Bible study that is basic, especially in book study. This rule can </div><div class="t m254 xd0 h35 y1b2f ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">be variously stated, but following is a simple form of it: In the study of the Bible one </div><div class="t md00 xd0 h35 y1fa1 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">must seek to discover what the words of Scripture were designed to mean to those to </div><div class="t m26e xd0 h35 y195c ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">whom they were first addressed; after that, what they mean for us today. This does not </div><div class="t me2 xd0 h35 y16cf ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">mean that what the Scriptures meant and what they mean in any given passage is </div><div class="t m689 xd0 h35 y222b ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">necessarily different. But historical circumstances change. Seventh-day Adventists </div><div class="t mf25 xd0 h35 y1bcf ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">are fortunate to have the spirit of prophecy to apply the message of Scripture to our </div><div class="t m37e xd0 h35 y1a4c ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">age. </div><div class="t mae xc4 h35 y1bfc ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Commenting on the Sermon on the Mount, Ellen White encourages the use of this </div><div class="t ma6e xd0 h35 y1591 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">rule in this way: </div><div class="t m541 xc4 h35 y1b6e ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Let us in imagination go back to that scene, and, as we sit with the disciples on the </div><div class="t m2a0 xd0 h35 y1a00 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">mountainside, enter into the thoughts and feelings that filled their hearts.

Paul had a particular reason for writing </div><div class="t md00 xd0 h35 y18f0 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to the Roman congregation. There were certain issues he wished to clarify. These we </div><div class="t m29a xd0 h35 y1f6f ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">must understand. But Paul did not write the letter merely for the benefit of the Roman </div><div class="t m350 xd1 h35 y1adc ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Christians.
