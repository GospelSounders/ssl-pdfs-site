Jobs </div><div class="t ma8 x4a h28 y29f4 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">are hard to find, and most work places remain open on Sabbath. It </div><div class="t m1dc x4a h28 y2909 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">takes great faith to walk away from a job on Friday afternoon, not </div><div class="t m316 x14 h28 y2400 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">knowing if the job will be there on Monday. Youth applying for work </div><div class="t m364 x4a h28 y2197 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">often are tempted to hide their religion for fear they will lose the job </div><div class="t m1ba0 x14 h28 y15dc ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">before they even get a chance to prove themselves. </div><div class="t m30b x29 h28 y1308 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">A strong youth organization in the church is crucial to maintain ties </div><div class="t m7ea x4a h28 y15cb ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">with God during these difficult times. The youth group at one church </div><div class="t me4b x14 h28 y1ccf ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in Blantyre, Malawi was organized to encourage spiritual growth and </div><div class="t m56c x14 h28 y15bc ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">outreach. One of its most powerful ministries is its prayer corp. When </div><div class="t mf43 x14 h28 yd53 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">a member of the group has a Sabbath or other spiritual problem, the </div><div class="t mce2 x14 h28 yfe1 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">entire group comes together in prayer. And knowing that friends </div><div class="t mcfd x14 h28 y116c ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">understand the difficulties and are praying has helped several young </div><div class="t m392 x14 h28 y19d1 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">people grow in faith and strength. One of them is Daniel. </div><div class="t mb55 x36 h28 y1cf9 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Daniel had been a faithful member until he went to work at a new </div><div class="t m674 x14 h28 y1ed2 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">job. Then he began missing church and youth meetings.The prayer </div><div class="t m64c x14 h28 y1dc2 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">corp began praying for him. Friends stopped by with encouragement </div><div class="t m601 x14 h28 y143b ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and literature. Daniel appreciated the visits and prayers. He explained </div><div class="t m43d x14 h28 y1f71 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that he was negotiating with his employer to have Sabbaths off and </div><div class="t m292 x14 h28 y1454 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">hoped he would soon have a breakthrough. But friends noticed that he </div><div class="t mee x14 h28 y1c66 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">came to church less and less. </div><div class="t mb31 x36 h28 y1339 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Then one Sabbath morning Daniel came to church and reported </div><div class="t m93f x14 h28 y12a3 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that his sister was sick and he must go home immediately. He asked </div><div class="t m1631 x14 h28 y117c ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">his friends to pray for her. </div><div class="t m769 x36 h28 yf39 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The next Sabbath Daniel was back in church. He told his friends </div><div class="t m86f x14 h28 y138c ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that his sister was seriously ill but had been glad to see him. &quot;She </div><div class="t m8a x14 h28 y195f ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">asked me to pray for her before I left,&quot; he said. He paused a moment, </div><div class="t m14d0 x14 h28 y1d75 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">then continued. &quot;I know she is dying, but she will die in Jesus.&quot; The </div><div class="t m163f x5d h28 y1cbb ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">peace on his face told of a faith that had grown. </div><div class="t m133e x28 h28 y1604 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Daniel was not in church the following week. But later he told his </div><div class="t m682 x5d h28 y1fd3 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">friends why. &quot;My sister died Sunday. On Sabbath she told my dad that </div><div class="t m1be8 x14 h28 y20a8 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">she was dying. But she promised him she would not die on Sabbath so </div><div class="t m1310 x5d h28 y118f ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that he would not need to make funeral arrangements on that day. God </div><div class="t m9fd x5d h28 ye13 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">let her live until early Sunday. She died peacefully, knowing that God </div><div class="t m252 x5d h28 y11b9 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">accepted her.&quot; </div><div class="t m403 x28 h28 y1d0d ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Daniel learned what was really important. Following his sister&apos;s </div><div class="t m30f x5d h28 y1343 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">death he told his employer that he would no longer work on Sabbaths. </div><div class="t m1bad x28 h22 y1519 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Beverly Herbrandson Koester, a former missionary in Malawi, is a </div><div class="t m2049 x5d h22 y1faa ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">teacher&apos;s aide at Atholton Adventist School in Maryland. </div><div class="t m141a x36 h28 y13cc ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Produced by the General Conference Office of Mission Awareness </div><div class="t m1572 x7c h28 y1250 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">E-mail: gomission@gc.adventist.org </div><div class="t m726 x4d h28 y1250 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0"> </div></div><div class="pi" data-data='{"ctm":[1.000000,0.000000,0.000000,1.000000,0.000000,0.000000]}'></div></div>
