When we stud-</div><div class="t m136c x26 h28 y2c50 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ied John 1, we learned that this Jesus, who has no beginning, brings each </div><div class="t ma2c x26 h28 y2cc0 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of us the gift of life. Last week&apos;s study of John 3:16 reminded us again that </div><div class="t mea4 x18 h28 y2c40 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the life He brings is everlasting or eternal life. Even though our limited </div><div class="t md0c x18 h28 y2b8b ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">minds may be unable to comprehend fully how long &quot;eternity&quot; is, the </div><div class="t m1068 x18 h28 y2442 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Lord still wants us to appreciate as much as we can how exceedingly </div><div class="t m501 x18 h28 y23b4 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">valuable the gift of eternal life is. </div><div class="t mf36 x74 h28 y234e ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">We also need to appreciate the difference between the idea of eternal </div><div class="t m56b x18 h28 y878 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">life and mere eternal existence. To exist forever would be no blessing at </div><div class="t mb94 x18 h28 y944 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">all if that eternity were one of boredom, loneliness, unsatisfied yearnings, </div><div class="t m190c x18 h28 y67c ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and constant battles with sin and self. </div><div class="t m8d2 x74 h28 y1a7d ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">But the eternal life that Jesus offers us is unlimited, not only in quantity </div><div class="t m393 x4a h28 y1ee ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">but in quality.

For us, </div><div class="t m663 x4a h28 y183a ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">eternal life can begin here and now. </div><div class="t ma9 x61 h28 y17cc ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">So come—let us walk together through the door to forever. </div><div class="t m38e x4a h22 y193e ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I.
