He </div><div class="t m7c4 x60 h28 yd74 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">rolled his eyes and said &quot;Yes, I know, just as you asked God to </div><div class="t m43b x5f h28 y1d99 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">keep the snow away.&quot; </div><div class="t m458 x83 h28 yf5d ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Maybe God is trying to talk to you,&quot; I said.
