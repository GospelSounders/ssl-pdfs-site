During their first missionary </div><div class="t m370 x61 h2d y2fa8 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">journey John Mark decided to return home. Paul, branding him a quitter, </div><div class="t m116c x64 h2d y2f13 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">refused to take him on their next overseas venture. Barnabas, however, was </div><div class="t mb06 x64 h2d y2da1 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">willing to overlook the weakness of young John Mark. He was willing to </div><div class="t m165e x64 h2d y29c3 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">give him a second chance, and took him on a missionary trip to Cyprus (Acts </div><div class="t m1b2 x64 h2d y29e4 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">15:36-41). </div><div class="t m6e8 xc h2d y29ee ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Onesimus had made many serious mistakes.

If so, this helped him to be less critical of Onesimus. &quot;Re-</div><div class="t m28e x64 h2d y1b54 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ceive him back,&quot; Paul wrote to Philemon, &quot;forget the past and give Onesi-</div><div class="t m6d2 x64 h2d y50a ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">mus another chance.
