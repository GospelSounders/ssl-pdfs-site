Each person in Israelite society had </div><div class="t mdf7 x29 h2d y2d69 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">been given certain rights by God. The responsibility of the court was to see </div><div class="t m1754 x29 h2d y29c8 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that those coming before them received their God-given rights. For exam-</div><div class="t m44c x29 h2d y2a15 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ple, because widows and orphans had no family to support them, they were </div><div class="t me3e x29 h2d y2a3a ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">guaranteed the right to be supported by the community.

Thus an Israelite who had a problem </div><div class="t m67b x29 h2d y2915 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">naturally turned to the court at the gate to solve it. </div><div class="t m713 x29 h6c y1f16 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ILLUMINATION: </div><div class="t mb98 x6a h2d y1d3c ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Abraham Heschel explained that &quot;justice in the Bible </div><div class="t mb0c x29 h2d ye92 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">must not be taken in a legal sense as the administration of law according to </div><div class="t mf3 x29 h2d y1c2d ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the rules of law by a judge.&quot; Rather it is &quot;an interpersonal relationship, </div><div class="t m3e0 x29 h2d y2005 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">involving a claim and a responsability, a right and a duty&quot; which applies </div><div class="t m7db x29 h2d y15cc ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;to both God and man.&quot;â€”The </div><div class="t m2bf x33 h4a yd51 ff6 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Prophets, vol. </div><div class="t m312 x91 h6c yd51 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">1, </div><div class="t m10f x57 h2d yd51 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">p. 210. </div><div class="t m310 x34 h2d y1e3c ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The downtrodden, the afflicted, and those suffering trials in Israel would </div><div class="t me6a x29 h2d y1551 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">look forward in a special way to judgment of this kind.

The courts at the gate were </div><div class="t m6b x29 h2d y10c3 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">not impersonal.
