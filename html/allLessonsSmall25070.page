When his Adventist parents died when he was 8 years old, </div><div class="t m1068 x3e h28 y28d3 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">he was sent to live with an unbelieving uncle. There he lived in </div><div class="t m1645 x3e h28 y290f ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">virtual slavery, forbidden to attend school and forced to work hard </div><div class="t m176 x3e h28 y23c3 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">all day. Often he was beaten for the other children&apos;s misdeeds. </div><div class="t m358 x73 h28 y2307 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">When Pena was 16, he left his uncle&apos;s home and joined the </div><div class="t m283 x3e h28 y1f47 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">guerrilla army fighting for Mozambique&apos;s freedom. Pena served in </div><div class="t m567 x3e h28 y5f5 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the army for several years before he was wounded in combat and </div><div class="t m38f x3e h28 y147e ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">discharged. </div><div class="t m792 x73 h28 y373 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Pena returned to his hometown where he met an Adventist </div><div class="t me47 x3e h28 y538 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">pastor who reintroduced him to Jesus Christ and the faith of his </div><div class="t m4cc x3e h28 y1ace ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">parents. It was then that Pena realized God had repeatedly saved his </div><div class="t md02 x3e h28 y11e ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">life during his troubled youth. Pena accepted God&apos;s love and Jesus&apos; </div><div class="t m40a x3e h28 y3cd ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sacrifice and was baptized. Then he set out to work for God. </div><div class="t m1d79 x73 h28 y9d6 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Living off the military retirement pay he received, Pena traveled </div><div class="t m8d8 x16 h28 yf27 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">from district to district, telling people about God&apos;s grace. Because </div><div class="t me8 x3e h28 y1cd9 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the war created a deep suspicion of strangers, Pena introduced </div><div class="t m131f x3e h28 yf9c ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">himself as an evangelist to the traditional authority or district leader. </div><div class="t m14a1 x3e h28 y416 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The area leader was compelled to introduce Pena to the people and </div><div class="t m5b5 x16 h28 y109c ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">provide him a place to hold meetings. This made Pena&apos;s work </div><div class="t m1cc x3e h28 y1006 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">somewhat easier because the people knew who he was before he </div><div class="t m625 x3e h28 y10e7 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">started witnessing. He studied with anyone who showed interest </div><div class="t m428 x16 h28 y181a ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and prepared many for baptism. When a group was ready for </div><div class="t m681 x16 h28 y176e ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">baptism, Pena would summon a minister to baptize them. Then he </div><div class="t mc9 x16 h28 y545 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">moved to another area and began again. In eight years Pena planted </div><div class="t m8a x16 h28 yc06 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">15 new churches, all of which continue to grow and multiply. </div><div class="t m1ada x73 h28 y63e ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">But Pena has suffered for his faith. Once he was accused of being </div><div class="t m381 x16 h28 y1bb2 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">a spy. He was tied up and spent the night in prison, under threat of </div><div class="t m7fc x16 h28 y6ad ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">death. After praying well into the night, he received assurance from </div><div class="t m1464 x16 h28 y3f4 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">God that his life would be spared. Three of the churches Pena </div><div class="t m7fa x16 h28 y6e5 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">planted were in Muslim areas, where he met with intense persecu-</div><div class="t m1178 x16 h28 ye67 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tion. And after one young man accepted the Adventist message, his </div><div class="t m5c9 x16 h28 yd63 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">family tried to kill Pena. </div><div class="t m1178 x73 h28 ycf9 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The civil war in Mozambique is over, but the war for the human </div><div class="t mf44 x16 h28 y37f ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">soul continues, and Pena continues to seek recruits to enlist in God&apos;s </div><div class="t m769 x16 h28 y1aa ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">army. And God continues to reward his efforts with baptisms and </div><div class="t m15b8 x71 h28 yf74 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">new churches. </div><div class="t mf56 x74 h22 y1697 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Januario Alssone de Pena is a lay evangelist living and </div><div class="t m76c x71 h22 ya09 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">working in Mozambique, East Africa. </div><div class="t m38f x61 h28 y22ae ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">For Current Newsbreak, Call 1-800-648-5824. </div></div><div class="pi" data-data='{"ctm":[1.000000,0.000000,0.000000,1.000000,0.000000,0.000000]}'></div></div>
