Tragically and incredibly, Adam and Eve yielded to Satan&apos;s </div><div class="t m19f2 x71 h28 y2d63 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">temptation. In mercy God spared their lives so that they might have opportu-</div><div class="t ma2b x71 h28 y2bfc ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">nity to repent, but the penalty for breaking God&apos;s law had to be met. Thus </div><div class="t m805 x71 h28 y2a06 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">God offered His own Son to come to this earth and die, taking the place of </div><div class="t mc6 x71 h28 y2c0e ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sinners. </div><div class="t m176 x73 h22 y2bff ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">What happy ending did God promise to the continuing conflict be-</div><div class="t md7 x71 h22 yf36 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tween good and evil? Gen. 3:15. </div><div class="t mb07 x73 h28 yda8 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">As time passed, the effects of sin became more and more evident, not </div><div class="t mcfa x71 h28 yb74 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">only in the human race but in all of nature. The principles advocated by </div><div class="t m1754 x71 h28 yed9 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Satan, at first but dimly seen as dangerous, bore a harvest of evil fruit. </div><div class="t m1737 x71 h28 ybad ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Nineteen centuries ago, when Satan inspired human beings to murder Jesus, </div><div class="t m760 x71 h28 ye78 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the beings in other worlds saw clearly that God was right and Satan was </div><div class="t m14b0 x71 h28 y73b ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">wrong. The inhabitants of heaven and the unfallen worlds saw that God is </div><div class="t m15b2 x71 h28 y594 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">love and that His law is just and necessary. But to give the inhabitants of our </div><div class="t m1662 x71 h28 ye45 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">world ample opportunity to understand the issues in the great controversy </div><div class="t m1b9f x71 h28 ye46 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">between Christ and Satan and to choose whose side they wanted to join, God </div><div class="t m191a x71 h28 yec4 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">permitted the sin drama to continue. </div><div class="t m1351 x73 h28 yd56 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Today the conflict is nearing its close. With great urgency the Holy Spirit </div><div class="t m8b5 x71 h28 yf29 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and the angels of heaven are seeking to help people choose God&apos;s sideâ€”</div><div class="t mcfe x71 h28 yff5 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">even to put loyalty to God, righteousness, and truth above life itself. The </div><div class="t m1897 x71 h28 y12ce ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Bible makes it clear that the ultimate outcome will be complete victory for </div><div class="t m131f x71 h28 yaab ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">God and the vindication of His character and law. Until that day of victory, </div><div class="t mebb x71 h28 yc03 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">good and evil will continue side by side.

THE BIBLE&apos;S COSMIC WORLD VIEW </div><div class="t m1147 x73 h28 ydb9 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Chronologically the first book of the Bible is Job, not Genesis. Whereas </div><div class="t m16aa x71 h28 y12d6 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Genesis is Planet-Earth centered, introducing us to the creation of the world </div><div class="t m3f1 x71 h28 y102b ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and everything in it, the book of Job is cosmic-centered. It is concerned with </div><div class="t m1674 x71 h28 ye11 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the universe as a whole. Already in the sixth verse of the first chapter it soars </div><div class="t m25b x71 h28 y110b ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">beyond Planet Earth to a cosmic united nations. &quot;Now there was a day when </div><div class="t mdc3 x71 h28 yae3 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord, and Satan also </div><div class="t m7f8 x71 h28 yae4 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">came among them. The Lord said to Satan, &apos;Whence have you come?&apos; Satan </div><div class="t m5d5 x71 h28 y66f ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">answered the Lord, &apos;From going to and fro on the earth, and from walking </div><div class="t m691 x26 h28 y1238 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">up and down on it&apos; &quot; (Job 1:6, 7, RSV). These &quot;sons of God&quot; apparently </div><div class="t m8a7 x26 h28 y753 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">were leaders from other inhabited worlds. Satan appeared as the usurper </div><div class="t m191a x26 h28 yee9 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">leader of Planet Earth. </div><div class="t m55f x73 h22 y1259 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">What did Christ have to say to Satan about Job? Job 1:8-12; 2:1-7. </div><div class="t mf23 x73 h28 y15ab ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">With the cosmic conflict in mind, Christ said: &quot;Satan, look at Job. He </div><div class="t m1ef x26 h28 y941 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">keeps my law. He is perfect!&quot; To which Satan countered, &quot;Yes, but he&apos;s </div><div class="t m522 x26 h28 yd4d ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">perfect because it pays to serve you. Don&apos;t you protect him?&quot; (See Job 1:9, </div><div class="t md32 x26 h28 ye6f ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">10.) Christ then allowed Satan to do what he wanted to Job in order to test </div><div class="t mdc8 x196 he y28ab ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">57 </div><div class="t m1a21 xc3 hb y3a6 ff2 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">TRUE </div></div><div class="pi" data-data='{"ctm":[1.000000,0.000000,0.000000,1.000000,0.000000,0.000000]}'></div></div>
