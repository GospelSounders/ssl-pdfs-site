They must listen to the sentence He was </div><div class="t m2ca x16 he y29fc ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">about to pronounce.

But they do not have a clue. Shamefacedly they </div><div class="t mb31 x16 he y1045 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">confess their ignorance and inability to solve the problem. </div><div class="t m536 x5d he y6dd ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Greater consternation takes hold of the king.
