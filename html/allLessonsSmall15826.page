The dead mockingbird on the sidewalk, the pet dog flung </div><div class="t ma9e xb7 h35 y23ba ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to the side of the road by a speeding automobile, the thorn on the stem support-</div><div class="t mb90 xb7 h35 y23ac ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ing a beautiful flower—these are matters that raise questions in the young open-</div><div class="t m35f x0 h35 y17e6 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ing mind. The shadows and the highlights grow more distinct and sharp as one </div><div class="t m1d0 x0 h35 y1fd8 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">matures. The human predicament seems mysterious. There seems to be an </div><div class="t m351 xb7 h35 y1cc1 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">eternal conflict between happiness and sorrow, between good and evil. Indeed, </div><div class="t ma49 xb7 h35 y191d ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to many, life seems absurd and senseless. </div><div class="t m44 x27 h35 y18b0 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">But in the Bible the veil is drawn aside, and meaning and purpose are given </div><div class="t m5e2 xb7 h35 y1a63 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to human experience. The Scriptures begin with a revelation of God, the Creator </div><div class="t me5d xb7 h35 y348 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of all that is good. Man is not the result of mere chance. Rather, he was created </div><div class="t m88b xb7 h35 y1878 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in the image of God by One who had beneficent plans and purposes for His </div><div class="t m1cf xb7 h35 y1f1 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">creation. </div><div class="t m128 x27 h35 y1722 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The Scriptures disclose the fact that the marring of the universe has come </div><div class="t m2d7 xb7 h35 y4fd ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">about by the insurrection of one of the highest intelligent beings close to the </div><div class="t m75a xb7 h35 yf99 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">throne of God. </div><div class="t m41b x11 h35 ye74 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">What we witness in the earth, behind all the interaction of mankind, is a moral </div><div class="t mb1d xb9 h35 y1b51 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">conflict between God and the principles of righteousness on the one hand, and </div><div class="t m3d5 xb7 h35 y1d8e ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Satan and the principles of unrighteousness on the other. God&apos;s will, expressed </div><div class="t ma7c xb7 h35 y17b2 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in His law, is based on a two-fold principle of love (supreme love to God, and </div><div class="t m7cb xb7 h35 y1673 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">impartial love to one&apos;s fellow beings). Satan&apos;s will, the fallen creature&apos;s will, is </div><div class="t m765 xb9 h35 y16b3 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">based on the principle of selfishness. Self is god; others are exploited for the </div><div class="t meb xb7 h35 yc22 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">benefit of selfish interests. </div><div class="t m225 x11 h35 y158d ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">These two principles—love and selfishness—have been in conflict since the </div><div class="t m98a xb9 h35 y12d ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">original rebellion and the later fall of Adam and Eve. </div><div class="t m51 x11 h35 yb39 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">In our lessons this quarter we shall focus on the moral controversy which </div><div class="t m605 xb9 h35 y1a33 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">lies beneath the apparent surface of human existence. We shall begin with a </div><div class="t m385 xb9 h35 y451 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">study of God our Creator, for He is the moral Governor of our universe, and all </div><div class="t m21b xb9 h35 y19f6 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">creation is subject to His laws, both physical and moral. </div><div class="t m365 x11 h35 y6aa ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">We shall then briefly survey the origin of evil and analyze the issues raised </div><div class="t m695 xb9 h35 y16ba ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">by Lucifer. In subsequent lessons we shall follow the controversy by means of </div><div class="t m9e3 xb9 h35 yf5f ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Bible prophecies, especially those of Daniel.

We shall see how Satan has carried on the same </div><div class="t m2e8 xb9 h35 y18ab ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">controversy through the organized ecclesiastical apostasy foretold by the </div><div class="t m26d xb9 h35 yb4e ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">prophets. We shall note that the conflict is also being fought within the ranks </div><div class="t m41d x3 h35 y1a37 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of Christian groups where genuine truth is taught. Every human mind is affected </div><div class="t m6d4 x3 h35 y198c ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">by this conflict.
