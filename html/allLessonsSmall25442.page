Inside the grass-roofed hut, </div><div class="t mb55 x16 h27 y28eb ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">villagers punched machete knives through cracks in the hut&apos;s floor </div><div class="t m75a x16 h27 y23e6 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and walls to drive out the evil spirits. In the corner of the hut, an </div><div class="t m57c x16 h27 y234f ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">old man waved burning ginger root over the stomach of a woman </div><div class="t m133e x16 h27 y49 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">curled up on a sleeping mat. A rumble of chants filled the night. </div><div class="t m19f9 x73 h27 y5f6 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Punsoray, lying on her mat, groaned, and the villagers redoubled </div><div class="t m98f x16 h27 yde8 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">their efforts to chase away the evil spirits that tormented her. The </div><div class="t mcdc x16 h27 y5c1 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">rising noise awoke student missionary Marisa Miller, sleeping in </div><div class="t m28f x16 h27 y70e ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the far end of the village. She made her way to the hut and </div><div class="t m693 x16 h27 y2fb ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">examined Punsoray. Then she hurried to our home. </div><div class="t mf43 x73 h27 y173 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;A woman in Tanoy&apos;s house has severe stomach pain,&quot; Marisa </div><div class="t m5cb x16 h27 y492 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">spoke into the darkness. Dawn Holbrook dressed, grabbed her bag, </div><div class="t m10f7 x16 h27 y1b5 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and followed the narrow path to Tanoy&apos;s house. She found Punsoray </div><div class="t mdbb x16 h27 y2db ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">curled up in a ball, moaning softly. Dawn looked at Tanoy. </div><div class="t mf36 x73 h27 y1073 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Is it OK to treat her?&quot; Dawn asked, shouting above the noise. </div><div class="t m1181 x16 h27 y6c0 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Tanoy nodded reluctantly. Dawn mixed some charcoal into a glass </div><div class="t m133f x16 h27 y501 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of water, then helped Punsoray sit up and drink it. Punsoray made a </div><div class="t m167b x16 h27 y585 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">weak protest at the taste of charcoal, then she lay down again. </div><div class="t mf6f x73 h27 y848 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;May I pray?&quot; Dawn shouted toward Tanoy. Again he nodded. </div><div class="t m356 x71 h27 yb7 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The spirits had not left; it was time to try something else. Dawn </div><div class="t m777 x71 h27 y497 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">prayed a simple prayer, asking God to heal Punsoray. Then she left </div><div class="t mb55 x71 h27 y267 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the hut, promising to check on her in the morning. </div><div class="t m1df x74 h27 y5e ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The next morning Dawn walked to Tanoy&apos;s house to check on </div><div class="t mb0c x71 h27 y34f ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Punsoray. But Punsoray was not there. Fear gripped Dawn. Had </div><div class="t m149b x71 h27 y15b ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the woman died? Had the family taken her somewhere? She began </div><div class="t m176 x71 h27 y1f ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">asking, &quot;Where is Punsoray? Have you seen her today?&quot; </div><div class="t m364 x74 h27 y234 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Yes, she is working in her </div><div class="t m2c7 x2f h35 y234 ff5 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">kiengan </div><div class="t mcf x70 h27 y234 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">(mountain garden).&quot; </div><div class="t m314 x74 h27 y58a ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;When did she begin to feel better?&quot; Dawn asked, amazed. The </div><div class="t m9c2 x71 h27 y134e ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">woman shrugged her shoulders and turned to enter her house. </div><div class="t m5d1 x74 h27 y7ff ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Several weeks later a villager asked Dawn, &quot;Do you remember </div><div class="t m1a11 x71 h27 y4ef ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">when Punsoray was sick, and the evil spirits would not leave her? </div><div class="t m624 x71 h27 y425 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">You came and prayed for her.&quot; Dawn nodded. &quot;The next day the </div><div class="t m160 x71 h27 y1a9 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">news was all over the village. Tanoy had been practicing his </div><div class="t m5c5 x71 h27 y308 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">medicine for two hours without results. But after your medicine </div><div class="t m31f x71 h27 y8fc ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and prayer, the pain left her within 15 minutes!&quot; </div><div class="t m5c7 x61 h27 y851 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">We serve an awesome God, and we praise Him for answered </div><div class="t mdbb x71 h27 y7f ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">prayer and the testimony of His healing power. </div><div class="t m15be x61 h6c y16a ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Dawn and Tim Holbrook are Adventist Frontier Missionaries, working </div><div class="t m46 x71 h6c y3c ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">among the Alangon people in the Philippines. </div><div class="t m29c4 x5d h27 yaa6 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Produced by the General Conference Office of Mission Awareness </div><div class="t ma2c xe9 h27 y14a8 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">95 </div></div><div class="pi" data-data='{"ctm":[1.000000,0.000000,0.000000,1.000000,0.000000,0.000000]}'></div></div>
