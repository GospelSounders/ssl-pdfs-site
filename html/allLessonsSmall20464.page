After all, the king could </div><div class="t m809 x3e he y2cb4 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">do as he pleased, and to attempt a protest in the circumstances would only create </div><div class="t m78e x16 he y2b5e ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">misunderstandings.

This indicates the direction of Daniel&apos;s thought; he </div><div class="t m40b x16 he yf11 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was concerned about Jerusalem. Furthermore, Solomon in his dedicatory prayer </div><div class="t m760 x16 he y1f5f ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of the temple, had suggested that effective prayer should be offered in the direc-</div><div class="t m47 x16 he y1d79 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tion of Jerusalem.

Nor did Daniel feel that he ought to keep his religious practices </div><div class="t m67b x16 he yc16 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">secret. Even when he would be breaking the law of the land by praying, he felt </div><div class="t ma3b x16 he y1a0f ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that the honest thing to do was to continue worshiping openly as he had done </div><div class="t m7e4 x16 he y5cf ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">before.

In the </div><div class="t m63f x16 he y18b4 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">circumstances his conscience told him that he must be true to his religious princi-</div><div class="t m5c7 x16 he yc1e ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ples.

To do otherwise would be to deny his faith. </div><div class="t m63f x48 h1 y5ec ff1 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Daniel&apos;s attitude and practice at this time indicate how we should respond </div><div class="t m302 x16 h1 y1a7a ff1 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in similar circumstances.
