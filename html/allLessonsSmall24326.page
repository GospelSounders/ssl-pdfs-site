We were called to a </div><div class="t m5d3 x4a h22 y2be8 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">district far from our friends and colleagues. After much prayer, we </div><div class="t me37 x4a h22 y2994 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">accepted this new assignment. It was difficult for me to move to this </div><div class="t mcf3 x4a h22 y2882 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">small village where I didn&apos;t know anyone, and had no work. </div><div class="t mcae x29 h22 y23c6 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I prayed for a ministry in my new village, and felt impressed to </div><div class="t m431 x4a h22 y239e ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">begin a child-care center as an outreach in this small town. I could </div><div class="t m1350 x4a h22 ydd7 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">meet adults by caring for their children. I hoped this would lead to </div><div class="t m77a x4a h22 y132f ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Bible studies with some of them. I found a place to operate the </div><div class="t m694 x4a h22 y1a80 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">child care center, and the first day I registered 10 children. </div><div class="t m774 x29 h22 y17c8 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Then trouble started. Caterpillars invaded the center. They </div><div class="t m1315 x4a h22 y923 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">came from everywhere. They secreted a poison that made the </div><div class="t m7f8 x4a h22 y1c56 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">children&apos;s skin break out in a rash. I couldn&apos;t keep the caterpillars </div><div class="t m1755 x14 h22 y1f51 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">off the children. Because of them, some of the children dropped </div><div class="t m9fd x14 h22 y193c ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">out. </div><div class="t m31d x36 h22 y16f8 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Then mosquitoes swarmed us without mercy. The children </div><div class="t mf32 x14 h22 y488 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">were being eaten alive. The parents threatened to keep the chil-</div><div class="t mbb2 x14 h22 yec6 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">dren home if the problem did not stop. I prayed. &quot;Lord, this is </div><div class="t m6c3 x14 h22 y10d4 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Your work. If it is Your will that I continue this child-care </div><div class="t m800 x14 h22 ya5e ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">program, please get rid of these mosquitoes.&quot; </div><div class="t m574 x36 h22 y2b9 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The next day I returned to the child-care center and stuck out </div><div class="t m1a29 x14 h22 y2df ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">my arm to test for mosquitoes. I waited a minute—no mosquitoes. </div><div class="t m281 x14 h22 y46e ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Five minutes. Ten minutes. Twenty minutes. Still no mosquitoes. </div><div class="t me54 x14 h22 y8bb ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">It was an answer to prayer! A few children came. At nap time, </div><div class="t m7f0 x14 h22 y1ca7 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">they asked me why I didn&apos;t cover them with mosquito netting. </div><div class="t m44b x14 h22 y68a ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;The mosquitoes are gone,&quot; I replied. Then I told them how I </div><div class="t mbe8 x14 h22 yc27 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">prayed to my Jesus and He had taken the mosquitoes away. &quot;They </div><div class="t mcd x14 h22 yaf1 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">will not be back ever to bother us again.&quot; </div><div class="t m149f x36 h22 yadf ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">That evening, the children told their parents. One mother could </div><div class="t m1944 x14 h22 ya98 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">not believe the mosquitoes were gone. I told her about my prayer. </div><div class="t m577 x14 h22 y1107 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">She stayed all day to see if it was really true. Then she told the </div><div class="t m38a x14 h22 y68f ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">entire village—no more mosquitoes! The next week 20 children </div><div class="t m1a11 x14 h22 y198b ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">came to the child-care center. In a couple of weeks our numbers </div><div class="t m13ad x5d h22 y238 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">grew to 40, then to 60. Many cried when I had no more room in </div><div class="t m636 x5d h22 y9e8 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the program. </div><div class="t m76f x28 h22 y1a53 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I can minister to these people because Jesus honored my prayer </div><div class="t m571 x5d h22 y1194 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and my desire to serve Him. The Lord is waiting to pour out </div><div class="t m7ef x5d h22 y13c ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">blessings to those who claim His promises to do His work. </div><div class="t m5c7 x28 h22 y14b2 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Maria is a pastor&apos;s wife living in Chiang Kong, in Northern </div><div class="t me49 x5d h22 y1e7f ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Thailand.
