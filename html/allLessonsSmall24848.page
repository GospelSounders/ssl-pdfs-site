It is not enough to </div><div class="t m760 x92 h27 ye17 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">be altered, changed, fixed up. The conversion that Jesus describes is </div><div class="t m3ba x92 h27 y2009 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">so completely different, so totally transforming, that only the image of </div><div class="t m3f2 x92 h27 y831 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">being born again is sufficient. This term has been so overused (and </div><div class="t m1cf x92 h27 y10b4 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">some would say abused) that it has lost much of its impact.
