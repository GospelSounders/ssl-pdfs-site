If it was illegal, the guards would have </div><div class="t m235 x14 he y2e78 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">executed summarily any would-be entrant. Instead, it is suggested that peo-</div><div class="t m3c0 x14 he y2cda ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ple could approach the king when he sat on his throne. But in doing so, they </div><div class="t m32d x14 he y296f ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">were staking everything on winning the king&apos;s favor. </div><div class="t m1f3 x29 he y29d8 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">One description of how this worked pictures a throne room with guards </div><div class="t m2b1 x14 he y2b65 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">lining each side and the king sitting at the end opposite the door. If an unbid-</div><div class="t ma71 x14 he y2a9c ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">den party entered the room, the guards fell in behind the person, with spears </div><div class="t m834 x14 he y28c8 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">lowered. The danger of assassination was ever present for the king. He and </div><div class="t m6be x14 he y210d ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">his guards always had to be alert. If some indication of his favor had not </div><div class="t m116 x14 he y204a ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">been given by the time the unbidden caller neared the throne, the guards </div><div class="t m812 x14 he ycbc ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">would execute the intruder. </div><div class="t ma8f x14 h1 y10b4 ff1 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">THINK IT THROUGH: Read Esther 5:3, 4. Was there any particular </div><div class="t m6b9 x14 h1 y1ccf ff1 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">wisdom in Esther&apos;s not pleading her case right then and there? If she </div><div class="t m170 x14 h1 y1cd0 ff1 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was trying to ensure that the king would be in an environment condu-</div><div class="t m1063 x14 h1 y1167 ff1 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">cive to the granting of her request, would that be a lack of faith? What is </div><div class="t m642 x14 h1 y1e8d ff1 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the proper balance between human effort and trusting God to do every-</div><div class="t me40 x14 h1 yd38 ff1 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">thing for us? </div><div class="t maa2 x29 he y144f ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">It is apparent (see Esther 5:5) that Esther used the three days that had </div><div class="t m88f x14 he y1db9 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">elapsed since Mordecai warned her of the death decree for more than </div><div class="t m669 x14 he y1174 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">fasting. Esther&apos;s banquet was ready a short time after her confrontation with </div><div class="t m811 x14 he y1e24 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the king. She planned carefully how she would be most likely to accomplish </div><div class="t m1b4 x14 he y15c0 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">her ends. God expects those who perform His will to plan their actions care-</div><div class="t m1ba x14 he y9f3 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">fully and well. </div><div class="t m58c x14 h1 y12a1 ff1 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ILLUMINATION: </div><div class="t ma73 x42 he y12a1 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;The crisis that Esther faced demanded quick, earnest </div><div class="t m23f x14 he y1e25 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">action; but both she and Mordecai realized that unless God should work </div><div class="t m6ae x14 he y19b8 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">mightily in their behalf, their own efforts would be unavailing. So Esther </div><div class="t m39f x14 he y18e1 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">took time for communion with God, the source of her strength.&quot;—Prophets </div><div class="t mf37 x14 h21 y117e ff6 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and Kings, </div><div class="t m163 x6 he y117e ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">p. 601. </div><div class="t m4c9 x64 h1 y1d2b ff1 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">When the meal was completed, what question did Ahasuerus ask Es-</div><div class="t m79c x14 h1 y12a7 ff1 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ther?

But as he could not move her, </div><div class="t m235 x14 he yd2c ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">he gave her the mantle; and she, rejoicing greatly in the gift, went flaunting </div><div class="t ma38 x14 he y1d77 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">her finery. &quot;—Herodotus IX. 104-11, quoted in Moore, </div><div class="t m3a3 x8d h21 y1d77 ff6 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Esther, </div><div class="t m2b0 xcd he y1d77 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Anchor Bi-</div><div class="t m6c3 x14 he y1094 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ble Series, vol. 7B (NY: Doubleday, 1975), p. 55. </div><div class="t m3a3 x64 he y11ff ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Such stories reveal much about the character of the man who let himself </div><div class="t ma3e x14 he y1129 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">be used in a plot to destroy God&apos;s people. </div><div class="t m57b x4a h1 y22cd ff1 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">84 </div></div><div class="pi" data-data='{"ctm":[1.000000,0.000000,0.000000,1.000000,0.000000,0.000000]}'></div></div>
