School officials </div><div class="t m19f7 x64 h27 y2b39 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">purchased land to build a new campus, but found squatters had </div><div class="t m362 x64 h27 y2a07 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">settled on the land. The school offered the squatters a piece of </div><div class="t m1196 x64 h27 y2109 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">property and money to build new homes. A village grew up on </div><div class="t m946 x64 h27 y2335 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the new land. </div><div class="t ma2d x6f h27 y20ef ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The villagers were farmers, and seasonal work did not pay </div><div class="t mf25 x64 h27 y735 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">well. When they saw new buildings on their former farmland, </div><div class="t m40a x64 h27 y1aac ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">they decided the new owners were rich, and they began stealing </div><div class="t m2c1 x64 h27 y1a7f ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">from the school. Theft got so bad that the school hired guards </div><div class="t m2b0 x64 h27 y15b6 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to patrol the campus. Tensions between the school and the </div><div class="t mdc9 x64 h27 y4c ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">villagers grew. How could the school hold up the banner of </div><div class="t mdf7 x64 h27 y106a ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">God&apos;s love and protect it&apos;s valuables at the same time? </div><div class="t m2e7 x6f h27 ye99 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Then ADRA sent some trainees into the village. They </div><div class="t me59 x64 h27 y435 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">talked about problems, cleaned the village, built latrines, and </div><div class="t m24e x29 h27 y377 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">provided immunizations for the children. But the village&apos;s </div><div class="t m689 x29 h27 y4a9 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">biggest problem was hunger. Students asked the school if the </div><div class="t m754 x29 h27 y1f57 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">villagers could plow an unused corner of the campus to grow </div><div class="t me1a x29 h27 y1da4 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">vegetables. The administration, seeing the chance to improve </div><div class="t m8a7 x29 h27 yb31 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">relations with the villagers, agreed. </div><div class="t m10fe x66 h27 y7f4 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Later, ADRA wanted to teach trainees gardening and water </div><div class="t m6e4 x29 h27 y10a9 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">development. The project leader suggested drilling a well in </div><div class="t m179 x29 h27 yd08 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the villagers&apos; garden to help increase their growing season. </div><div class="t ma8 x29 h27 y1ce2 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Villagers watched as the team started drilling.

However, they couldn&apos;t finish drilling until </div><div class="t m206 x29 h27 y41b ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Sunday. Did they dare leave the portable well-driller un-</div><div class="t m1717 x29 h27 ycd8 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">guarded in the villagers&apos; garden—the same villagers who had </div><div class="t ma9a x29 h27 y1b34 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">stolen supplies from the school? </div><div class="t m388 x66 h27 yb41 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The project leader begged the school to leave the well driller </div><div class="t mcd3 x29 h27 y6d2 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in the garden. &quot;Think of the negative message you will send if </div><div class="t ma32 x29 h27 y964 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">you guard it,&quot; he said.
