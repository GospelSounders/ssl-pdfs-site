and having been here he knows just how to sym-
pathize with and help me. How this thought
ought to drive away the darkness and give strength
and cheer!

appetite of Christ under the most trying circum-
stances. Jesus would not work a miracle to relieve
himself, but endured it as a man who could not
work a miracle, but simply trust: God.
  .2. In the second temptation Satan says: Now
in the first temptation you trusted God ; you were
right in so doing. Now I want you to do the same
here, and trust him still further. Thus he seeks to
lead Jesus into presumption, just where many then
fall, for the land of presumption borders on the
pathway of trust.
   3. In the third temptation Satan appeals to man's
love for glory and power, and seeks to add strength
to this by reminding Jesus that he has come here
to die to obtain all this, but to obtain which he of-
fers an easier way. Worship me and you shall
have
   4. According to Rom. 6:16, Adam, by obeying
Satan, became his servant, and his possessions,with

  T. The curse of the earth was thorns and thistles.
When the Jews in their madness and mockery
plaited that crown of thorns, and pressed it upon
the Saviour's brow until the blood trickled down
the Sufferer's face, little did they think that they
were thus saying to the world, Behold the One who
bears the curse of the earth.
13                LIFE OF CHRIST.


   2. The burden of the sin of the world was upon
him, a mocking crowd about him; his Father with-
drew his presence; the strain was too great, and he
died of a broken heart. Physicians tell us that the
flow of blood and water testified to this fact. See
John 19 : 34.

                       NOTE.
  Oh, what great assurance God has given us con-
cerning the resurrection of Christ! The strongest
nation of earth undertook to guard that tomb, hav-
ing sealed it with the seal of the iron kingdom
which bore rule over all the earth. To oppose
that guard or to break that seal was death to any
man. But what cares the angel for the soldiers'
guard? What cares he for the Roman seal? He
holds a commission from the One whose throne is in
the heavens, whose kingdom ruleth over all. He
smites the guard to the earth, lays his hand upon
that stone, and the seal is broken, the grave opened;
and then, unlike the spy, who, under the cover of
darkness, enters an enemy's land, and, having ac-
complished his object, hastens away to escape de-
tection, he complacently sits down upon the stone
bearing the broken seal, while the tomb is emptied
of its treasure. " His disciples stole him away."
Indeed! Was Rome in the habit of lightly passing
over such negligences on the part of her guards?
—Oh, no! The fact is patent, Rome had come in
contact with a higher power, and suffered an ig-
nominious defeat
