Another unique characteristic of Matthew&apos;s </div><div class="t m93 x34 hc y90 ff3 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Gospel is that he includes individuals who do not seem to be as impor-</div><div class="t m94 x34 hc y91 ff3 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tant to the other Gospel writers. Matthew also portrays Jesus as standing </div><div class="t m95 x34 hc y92 ff3 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">firmly for truth contrary to popular opinion. </div><div class="t m96 x33 hc y93 ff3 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">This Gospel establishes Jesus&apos; credibility as a legitimate &quot;son of </div><div class="t m97 x34 hc y94 ff3 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">David&quot; and &quot;son of Abraham.&quot; Compared with the other Gospel </div><div class="t m98 x34 hc y95 ff3 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">writers, Matthew quotes the Old Testament most frequently in support </div><div class="t m99 x34 hc y96 ff3 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of Christ&apos;s ministry. At a time when would-be messiahs frequently arose </div><div class="t m9a x34 hc y97 ff3 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">claiming to fulfill the Old Testament prophecies, Matthew took pains to </div><div class="t m9b x34 hc y98 ff3 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">show that Jesus alone adequately met these requirements of messiahship. </div><div class="t m9c x34 hc y99 ff3 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">In doing so, he had to deal with a large number of fallacious assump-</div><div class="t m9d x34 hc y9a ff3 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tions regarding the nature of the promised King. </div><div class="t m30 x33 hc y9b ff3 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Matthew begins Christ&apos;s genealogy with Abraham.
