When the </div><div class="t m63e x9c h1f y9d9 ff3 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Adventist mission school had closed for lack of money, church </div><div class="t m31d x9c h1f y1ca ff3 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">members began to scatter. Some moved to villages that still had a </div><div class="t m38b x9c h1f y403 ff3 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">school, but others simply stopped attending church. Fausto and his </div><div class="t m62c x9c h1f y9da ff3 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">wife tried to keep the church alive. They held regular services, but </div><div class="t m602 x9c h1f y405 ff3 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the attendance dwindled until only the two of them came. They </div><div class="t m2db x9c h1f y9db ff3 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">prayed earnestly for their village, but the outlook seemed dim. </div><div class="t m63f x8c h1f y80d ff3 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Villagers began tying their goats and sheep in the church to </div><div class="t m1f7 x9c h1f y80e ff3 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">keep them out of the rain. Then some villagers began taking boards </div><div class="t m3dd x9c h1f y9dc ff3 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">from the walls of the church to use for firewood. Fausto tried to </div><div class="t m150 x9c h1f y9dd ff3 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">stop them, but boards continued to disappear. </div><div class="t m15 x8c h1f y576 ff3 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">One day someone noticed that many villagers had large tropical </div><div class="t m26d x9c h1f y9de ff3 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ulcers on their legs. It seemed that the ulcers broke out mostly on </div><div class="t m640 x9 h1f y578 ff3 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">people who had desecrated the church. The superstitious people </div><div class="t m265 x9 h1f y579 ff3 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">decided that they were being punished for damaging God&apos;s church, </div><div class="t m641 x9 h1f y810 ff3 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and they stopped taking the wood. </div><div class="t m1cf x8d h1f y9df ff3 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Fausto was invited to move to another village and minister to an </div><div class="t m642 x9 h1f y57b ff3 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">active Adventist church. He decided that if the church did not </div><div class="t m205 x9 h1f y1f6 ff3 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">show growth within three months, he would accept the call. Soon </div><div class="t m26d x9 h1f y1f7 ff3 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">after this Fausto learned that student missionaries from Mountain </div><div class="t m643 x9 h1f y1f8 ff3 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">View College were coming to reopen the school. The villagers </div><div class="t m448 x9 h1f y9e0 ff3 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">welcomed the missionaries, and some began taking Bible studies </div><div class="t m5e1 x9 h1f y9e1 ff3 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">from Fausto and the students. Many who had slipped away began </div><div class="t m644 x9 h1f y1fb ff3 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">attending church again. Within four months 147 precious souls </div><div class="t m9a x9 h1f y9e2 ff3 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">were baptized. Fausto and his wife did not leave their village.
