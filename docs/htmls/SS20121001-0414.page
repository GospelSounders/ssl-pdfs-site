He had heard that they are sinners </div><div class="t m0 x61 h6 y224 ff14 fs4 fc3 sc0 lsf wsc4">because they worked in their gardens on Sunday. But Gustave decided to </div><div class="t m0 x61 h6 y225 ff14 fs4 fc3 sc0 lsf ws6">attend the meetings anyway. He hoped to learn something new about God.</div><div class="t m0 x43 h6 y226 ff14 fs4 fc3 sc0 lsf ws3d">The messages touched his heart. Gustave attended the meetings when they </div><div class="t m0 x61 h6 y227 ff14 fs4 fc3 sc0 lsf wsc5">didn’t conflict with school. By the end of the second week, Gustave had many </div><div class="t m0 x61 h6 y228 ff14 fs4 fc3 sc0 lsf ws51">questions. He asked the church elder to study the Bible with him. Before long </div><div class="t m0 x61 h6 y229 ff14 fs4 fc3 sc0 lsf wsb1">Gustave was convinced that Seventh-day Adventists weren’t sinning when </div><div class="t m0 x61 h6 y22a ff14 fs4 fc3 sc0 lsf wsc6">they worked on Sunday; they were keeping the Bible Sabbath.

When Gustave’s parents learned about </div><div class="t m0 x61 h6 y22f ff14 fs4 fc3 sc0 ls2 wsca">it, they were upset. “Please allow me to worship God as He leads me,” </div><div class="t m0 x61 h6 y230 ff14 fs4 fc3 sc0 ls2 ws6">Gustave pleaded. </div><div class="t m0 x43 h6 y231 ff14 fs4 fc3 sc0 ls2 ws1f">Gustave tried to explain his faith to the school principal too, hoping </div><div class="t m0 x61 h6 y232 ff14 fs4 fc3 sc0 ls2 wscb">that he would excuse Gustave from classes.
