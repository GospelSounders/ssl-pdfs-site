That is </div><div class="t m302 x3a h14 y684 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">because they are comparing themselves to others or to the world </div><div class="t m1c8 x3a h14 y685 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">around them. People always can find others to compare themselves </div><div class="t m5fc x3a h14 y686 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">with who are worse then they are.

Which, of course, is where Christ, </div><div class="t m3bb x3a h14 y68f ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the Cross, and the gospel come in. Indeed, God&apos;s revelation of His </div><div class="t m5fd x52 h14 y690 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">holiness was not intended to devastate Isaiah or us. God reveals </div><div class="t m4b3 x52 h14 y691 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Himself to us in order to humble us, not to humiliate us.
