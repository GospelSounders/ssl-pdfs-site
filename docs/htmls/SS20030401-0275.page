That is </div><div class="t m302 x39 h11 y683 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">because they are comparing themselves to others or to the world </div><div class="t m1c8 x39 h11 y684 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">around them. People always can find others to compare themselves </div><div class="t m5fc x39 h11 y685 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">with who are worse then they are.

On the contrary, as Isaiah&apos;s </div><div class="t m55e x39 h11 y689 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">example shows, no one who comes into contact with God in such a </div><div class="t m533 x39 h11 y68a ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">manner comes away unaware of his or her own personal sinfulness. </div><div class="t m190 x4e h11 y68b ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Perhaps that is what the world needs: a glimpse of the holiness </div><div class="t m155 x39 h11 y68c ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of God. Because only then will individuals not only see their true </div><div class="t m5e4 x39 h11 y68d ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">state, they will seek a remedy. Which, of course, is where Christ, </div><div class="t m3bb x39 h11 y68e ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the Cross, and the gospel come in. Indeed, God&apos;s revelation of His </div><div class="t m5fd x51 h11 y68f ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">holiness was not intended to devastate Isaiah or us. God reveals </div><div class="t m4b3 x51 h11 y690 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Himself to us in order to humble us, not to humiliate us. There is a </div><div class="t m59 x51 h11 y691 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">difference.
