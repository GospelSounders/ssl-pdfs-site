He makes no men-</div><div class="t m779 x13 h1f yb8d ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tion of &quot;false prophets&quot; or &quot;false teachers&quot; (2 Peter 2:1). Instead, he </div><div class="t m673 x13 h1f yb8e ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">speaks of &quot;certain men&quot; who are &quot;ungodly&quot; or &quot;impious,&quot; &quot;lascivious&quot; </div><div class="t m5dd x13 h1f y562 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">or &quot;immoral,&quot; and who deny the lordship or divinity of Christ. He then </div><div class="t m54 x13 h1f y563 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">markedly departs from Peter&apos;s outline, making no reference to Noah or to </div><div class="t m3bd x13 h1f y564 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Lot, but writing of Israel&apos;s escape from Egypt and the death of the un-</div><div class="t m130 x11 h1f y565 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">grateful, unbelieving multitude (verse 5). (Compare Num. 14:26-33.) </div><div class="t m77a x11 h1f yb8f ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Jude&apos;s comment on the rebellious angels is close to Peter&apos;s but stresses </div><div class="t m77b x11 h1f yb90 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the finality of their punishment, for they were to be shackled &quot;in everlast-</div><div class="t m69 x11 h1f y567 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ing chains&quot; from which there would be no escape until judgment day. In a </div><div class="t m77c x11 h1f y568 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">manner somewhat similar to Peter&apos;s he comments on the fate of the twin </div><div class="t m45a x11 h1f yb91 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">cities of the plain. But he adds &quot;the cities about them,&quot; which confirms </div><div class="t m2ce x11 h1f y56a ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">their gross immorality and the irreversible nature of their end—they suf-</div><div class="t m4fd x11 h1f y56b ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">fered &quot;the vengeance of eternal fire,&quot; that is, unquenchable fire (verse 7). </div><div class="t m77d x45 h1f y56c ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">But these are differences in approach only. There is no conflict between </div><div class="t m77e x11 h1f yb07 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Peter and Jude in their assessment of the dangers confronting their </div><div class="t m5c3 x11 h1f yb08 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">churches. It is inevitable that there should be differences between Peter </div><div class="t m315 x11 h1f y51d ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and Jude, for the apostle devotes 22 verses (2:1-22) or a whole chapter to </div><div class="t m77f x11 h1f y570 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the destructive work of the errant teachers, while Jude uses only 12 </div><div class="t m780 x11 h1f yb0a ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">verses (5-16) for the same purpose. Furthermore, Jude spends more </div><div class="t m38b x11 h1f yb0b ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">space on certain topics than does Peter, so the difference between the two </div><div class="t m4e7 x11 h1f yb0c ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">epistles grows even greater. This is emphasized when we note that Peter </div><div class="t m380 x11 h1f y572 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">deals with &quot;the angels that sinned&quot; in verse 4 and does not refer to &quot;an-</div><div class="t m580 x11 h1f yb0d ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">gels which are greater in power and might&quot; until verse 11, six intervening </div><div class="t m781 x11 h1f y574 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">verses later. Jude, by contrast, makes his corresponding references in </div><div class="t m248 x11 h1f yb0f ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">verses 6 and 9, with only two intervening verses. It will also be noted that </div><div class="t m1ea x11 h1f yb92 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Peter&apos;s reference to great and powerful angels in verse 11 does not men-</div><div class="t m45a x11 h1f yb10 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tion &quot;Michael the archangel,&quot; whereas Jude is specific, introducing the </div><div class="t m64d x11 h1f yb93 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">angelic leader by name and identifying the topic of dispute, &quot;the body of </div><div class="t m473 x11 h1f yb11 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Moses&quot; (verse 9). </div><div class="t m1b1 x45 h1f yb94 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Closer examination of Jude&apos;s message reveals that while he gives more </div><div class="t m2d2 x11 h1f y72a ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">attention to the dispute over Moses, he deals only briefly with Balaam, </div><div class="t m61d x11 h1f y11 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and then refers to others whom Peter does not even mention, namely, </div><div class="t m782 x11 h1f y7fc ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Core or Korah (Jude 11; see also Numbers 16) and Cain. This may suggest </div><div class="t m2cd x11 h1f yb95 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that the two authors were writing for different groups of readers—Jude </div><div class="t m132 x11 h1f y57e ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">for Jewish Christians, Peter for Gentiles.
