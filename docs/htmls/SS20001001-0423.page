He was a quiet boy who worked hard. His </div><div class="t m145 x56 ha y2d3 ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">father worked for an Adventist farmer, and when Cicero was 12 </div><div class="t m46 x56 ha yb2 ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">years old, the farmer invited him to work on the farm, too. </div><div class="t m2c8 x41 ha y2d4 ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Cicero proved to be an honest and faithful worker, and the farmer&apos;s </div><div class="t m1e9 x56 ha y2d5 ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">family invited him to live with them. When the family went to the city, </div><div class="t m2c9 x56 ha y2d6 ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">they trusted Cicero to take care of the farm. They often talked to Cicero </div><div class="t m20 x56 ha y2d7 ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">about God and invited him to attend church with them. Thus Cicero </div><div class="t m2ca x56 ha y2d8 ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">met God. He had never attended school, but he taught himself to read </div><div class="t m2cb x56 ha yb8 ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">so he could read the Bible with his new family. Often the farmer saw </div><div class="t m1e5 x56 ha y2d9 ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Cicero standing among the trees, preaching to an invisible audience. </div><div class="t m2cc x41 ha ybb ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Cicero was baptized when he was 16. He enjoyed taking part in </div><div class="t m2cd x56 ha y2da ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">church activities and dreamed that one day he would preach in church. </div><div class="t m6e x56 ha y2db ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The lay elders often preached when the pastor was absent. Finally, </div><div class="t m2ce x56 ha y2dc ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Cicero found the courage to offer to preach. He carefully wrote his </div><div class="t m2cf x56 ha y2dd ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">own sermon. After that he often preached. </div><div class="t m2d0 x4b ha yc0 ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">As they worked together on the farm, Cicero talked to his younger </div><div class="t m68 x6 ha y2de ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">brothers, Jose, 15, and Ricardo, 13, about God and invited them to </div><div class="t m2d1 x6 ha y2df ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">attend church with him. </div><div class="t m2d2 x4b ha yc3 ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">One day Jose and Ricardo were weeding when they heard a noise </div><div class="t m2d3 x6 ha y2e0 ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and looked up to see Cicero stumbling toward them. The boys ran to </div><div class="t m2d4 x6 ha y2e1 ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">their brother. They saw that he was sick and remembered he had been </div><div class="t m2d5 x6 ha y2e2 ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">spraying insecticide that morning. They realized he must be suffering </div><div class="t m2d6 x6 ha yc7 ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">from insecticide poisoning. Ricardo wanted to run for help, but Cicero </div><div class="t m2d7 x6 ha y2e3 ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">stopped him. &quot;I am going to sleep now,&quot; Cicero said. &quot;You boys follow </div><div class="t m2d8 x6 ha y2e4 ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Jesus and tell everyone to be ready, for His coming is soon. I want to </div><div class="t m2d9 x6 ha y2e5 ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">see you in heaven.&quot; Cicero was losing consciousness as Ricardo raced </div><div class="t m2da x6 ha y2e6 ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">for help. </div><div class="t m2db x4b ha ycc ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Cicero was unconscious when a neighbor arrived. He loaded the </div><div class="t m2dc x6 ha y2e7 ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">young man into the car for the 20-minute drive to the nearest hospital. </div><div class="t m2dd x6 ha y2e8 ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">When they arrived doctors tried to revive the boy, but he did not </div><div class="t m2de x86 ha y2e9 ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">respond. Within an hour Cicero was dead. </div><div class="t m1f0 x72 ha y2ea ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Ricardo and Jose told their mother what Cicero had said before he </div><div class="t m2df x6 ha y9e ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">died. She had attended church when Cicero preached, but her husband </div><div class="t m1cb x6 ha yd2 ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">would not permit her to be baptized. After Cicero&apos;s death she did not </div><div class="t m2e0 x86 ha y2eb ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ask permission. She and her children began attending church regularly. </div><div class="t m2e1 x86 ha y2ec ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">She and her daughter and Jose were baptized. Cicero&apos;s testimony led </div><div class="t m2e2 x86 ha y2ed ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">them to Christ.
