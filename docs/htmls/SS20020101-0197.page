It was sunset, </div><div class="t m2a2 x54 he y8c4 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and except for traffic in the road, the streets were nearly empty. </div><div class="t m5ab x1d he y392 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Ruffians controlled the streets from dusk to dawn. </div><div class="t m5e5 x91 he y8c5 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">As I rounded a corner beside an abandoned bus, the engine began to </div><div class="t m38b x1d he y8c6 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">run rough, and the temperature light came on. Then the engine died. I </div><div class="t m22 x54 he y8c7 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">pulled the loaded station wagon onto the gravel shoulder. </div><div class="t m40a x91 he y8c8 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Forcing back the fear that was building in my stomach, I took off </div><div class="t m19b x1d he y44 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">my suit coat and tie and got out to examine the problem. The radiator </div><div class="t m6f9 x54 he y8c9 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was empty. I managed to borrow a bucket of water, but it ran out as </div><div class="t m6fa x1d he y8ca ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">quickly as I poured it in. Fear rose another notch. I was a well-dressed </div><div class="t m6cf x1d he y8cb ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">foreigner with a disabled car filled with expensive computer equip-</div><div class="t m7c x1d he y8cc ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ment in a dangerous area of the city. </div><div class="t m6fb x91 he y3f7 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Two men stepped out of the abandoned bus. They picked up a large </div><div class="t m6fc x1d he y6aa ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">rock, then started toward me. No one else was nearby. Staying meant </div><div class="t m6fd x1d he y8cd ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">risking a beating and possibly death. Leaving would place God&apos;s </div><div class="t mb5 x1d he y8ce ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">equipment at risk. I prayed that God would protect both the equipment </div><div class="t m612 x1d he y8cf ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and me. The men raised their rocks as if to throw them. I stepped back. </div><div class="t m5a7 x91 he y8d0 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Excuse me,&quot; a nicely dressed man spoke quietly to me. &quot;Your life </div><div class="t m5b7 x1d he y8d1 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">is in danger. Get in the car and leaveâ€”now.&quot; </div><div class="t m1e x1e he y8d2 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I tried to explain that the car wasn&apos;t going anywhere, but the man </div><div class="t m28 x1d he y8d3 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">insisted, &quot;Get in. I will push.&quot; Again I tried to explain the situation, but </div><div class="t m2ee x1d he y8d4 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the man ordered, &quot;Get in, now!&quot; I obeyed, though I was certain that the </div><div class="t m6e9 x1d he y8d5 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">effort was futile. I turned on the ignition and shifted into gear. </div><div class="t m677 xc4 he y8d5 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">There is </div><div class="t m31f x1d he y8d6 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">no way he can push this heavy car uphill on gravel, </div><div class="t m6fe xa3 he y8d6 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I thought. </div><div class="t m6ff x1e he y27 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I could see the two men, still holding the rocks above their heads, as </div><div class="t m521 x1d he y3d1 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">they had been when the stranger had approached. </div><div class="t m700 x1e he y8d7 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The car started to move. As it gathered speed, I let out the clutch and </div><div class="t m41d x1d he y8d8 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was surprised to hear the engine come to life. The stranger ran to my </div><div class="t m701 x1d he y8d9 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">window and insisted that I not stop until I was out of this dangerous </div><div class="t m702 x1d he y8da ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">area. I tried to force a few dollars into his reluctant hand, but he said, &quot;I </div><div class="t m4c4 x1d he y8db ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">have no need for money.&quot; </div><div class="t m703 x1e he y8dc ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I drove a few blocks before the temperature light again came on, and </div><div class="t m2ee x1d he y8dd ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the engine sputtered and died. As I coasted into a gas station, I realized </div><div class="t m35f x1d he y8de ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that God had answered my prayer by sending an angel to protect both </div><div class="t m5b1 x1d he y110 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">me and the Lord&apos;s equipment. </div><div class="t m704 x11 he y8df ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">We live in a world filled with spiritual and physical dangers. God is </div><div class="t m5b4 x1d he y8e0 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">able and willing to care for us if we place ourselves in His hands. </div><div class="t m40d x11 h38 y8e1 ff5 fs17 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">David Gates is director of ADRA/Guyana. </div><div class="t m705 x6f he y85d ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Produced </div><div class="t m706 x9f h22 y85d ff4 fs17 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">by </div><div class="t m707 x1 he y3f2 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the Office of Mission </div><div class="t m708 x2c he y3f3 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Sabbath School-Personal Ministries department of the General Conference </div><div class="t m709 xb2 he y38c ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Email: gomission@gc.adventist.org </div><div class="t m14d x25 he y38c ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0"> </div></div><div class="pi" data-data='{"ctm":[1.000000,0.000000,0.000000,1.000000,0.000000,0.000000]}'></div></div>
