After a worship service on the beach, 30 pastors </div><div class="t m17e x2b hd y20a ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">stood in the crashing waves of the Pacific Ocean and baptized </div><div class="t m1f4 x2b hd y20b ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">nearly 1,000 people. After the service a man gave his testimony. </div><div class="t m1f5 x35 hd y20c ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">His name is Baget. He is a member of the B&apos;Laan tribe, an animist </div><div class="t m1f6 x2b hd y20d ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">people living on the island of Mindanao. For years, he had robbed—</div><div class="t mdf x2b hd y20e ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and sometimes killed—his victims. He had earned a well-deserved </div><div class="t m1f7 x2b hd y20f ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">reputation as a ruthless murderer, and was feared by the community. </div><div class="t m1f8 x35 hd y210 ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">But one day a glorious being appeared to Baget. His face was </div><div class="t m1f9 x2b hd y211 ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">kind, and shone like the sun. He told Baget, &quot;You must worship the </div><div class="t m1fa x2b hd y212 ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">God of heaven on </div><div class="t m1fb x4c hd y212 ff7 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Sabado </div><div class="t m1fc x7b hd y212 ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">[Saturday], God&apos;s holy day.&quot; Then the </div><div class="t m1fd x2b hd y213 ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">being was gone.

On </div><div class="t m1fe x51 hd y214 ff7 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Sabado? </div><div class="t m1ff x5b hd y215 ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">This was some-</div><div class="t m200 x2b hd y216 ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">thing new to Baget. The Christians he had encountered all wor-</div><div class="t m14d x2b hd y217 ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">shiped on Sunday. Why would this glorious being tell him to </div><div class="t mf8 x2b hd y218 ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">worship on another day? </div><div class="t m201 x35 hd y219 ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The shining being returned to Baget several times. Each time he </div><div class="t m202 x2b hd y21a ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">revealed more of what Baget must do to worship the true God. </div><div class="t m203 x2b hd y1f ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Baget told his village elders of the being&apos;s visits and messages. </div><div class="t m204 x2b hd y21b ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The villagers, impressed by the visions, decided to obey. </div><div class="t m205 x35 hd y21c ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">When Sunday-keeping missionaries entered the village, the villag-</div><div class="t m206 x2b hd y21d ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ers rejected their messages, for they did not teach the same truths as </div><div class="t mca x2b hd y21e ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the glorious being. Then the local Adventist mission heard about the </div><div class="t m207 x2b hd y21f ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">angel visits and sent a lay preacher to study with the people. As Baget </div><div class="t md6 x2b hd y220 ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and the villagers listened, they recognized that the lay preacher&apos;s </div><div class="t mfb xc hd yc9 ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">teachings were the same as the glorious visitor&apos;s. They welcomed the </div><div class="t m1e9 xc hd y221 ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">lay preacher and joined his Bible studies. </div><div class="t m208 x2 hd y222 ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Following recent evangelistic meetings, Baget brought 25 of his </div><div class="t m209 x60 hd y223 ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">fellow B&apos;Laan people to the mass baptism </div><div class="t m20a x60 hd y224 ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in the ocean to be baptized.
