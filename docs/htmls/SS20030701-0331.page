When she lost </div><div class="t m26f x2f h2d y3cf ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">her job as a tractor driver, life became even more difficult. With three </div><div class="t m30e x2f h2d y3d0 ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">children still at home, suddenly she had no income and not enough </div><div class="t m365 x4a h2d y3d1 ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">food. Her friends avoided her, for they feared that she would beg them </div><div class="t m113 x4a h2d y3d2 ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">for food or money, and they did not have any to spare either. </div><div class="t m366 x49 h2d y3d3 ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">One day some foreigners came to town with food, clothes, and </div><div class="t m367 x4a h2d y3d4 ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Bibles. They gave Hartlah some food and a Bible. She began to read it </div><div class="t m26f x4a h2d y10f ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and began to understand that there is a God named Jesus. </div><div class="t m368 x49 h2d y49 ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">She wanted to know more about God, but the foreigners left, and </div><div class="t m369 x4a h2d y3d5 ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">she knew of no one in town who believed in God, no one who would </div><div class="t m36a x4a h2d y3d6 ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tell her more. Then Hartlah heard of Sarool, a girl in town who </div><div class="t m36b x4a h2d y3d7 ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">believed in Jesus. She visited Sarool and began asking her about Jesus. </div><div class="t m6e x49 h2d y3d8 ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The woman and the young girl started studying the Bible together. </div><div class="t m36c x4a h2d y3d9 ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Hartlah was the first person in Sant to study the Bible. Sarool started a </div><div class="t m33d x4a h2d y3da ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">small group meeting in her parents&apos; house. More people came. In a </div><div class="t m308 x4a h2d y3db ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">year about 10 people were studying the Bible together. </div><div class="t m36d x37 h2d y117 ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Hartlah&apos;s life began to change as she started to understand and </div><div class="t m36e x4a h2d y3dc ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">accept God&apos;s love in her life. Her life took on new meaning and </div><div class="t m36f x4a h2d y3dd ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">happiness. She realized that she was a sinful person, and she wanted to </div><div class="t m13f x4a h2d y3de ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">give her life to Christ. Soon she traveled to another city to be baptized, </div><div class="t m2bf x75 h2d y3df ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">for there was no pastor anywhere near her little village. </div><div class="t m370 x37 h2d y3e0 ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Before Christ took over her life, she was often unhappy and argued </div><div class="t m39 x4a h2d y3e1 ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">a lot. Now she loves to help others. People teased her when she started </div><div class="t m23d x75 h2d y3e2 ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">worshiping God, but as her life changed her friends noticed the differ-</div><div class="t m24b x75 h2d y3e3 ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ence. She is now studying the Bible with one of her neighbors. </div><div class="t m371 x37 h2d yd7 ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">A volunteer missionary moved to Sant to help support the small </div><div class="t m372 x3e h2d y3e4 ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">group of believers.
