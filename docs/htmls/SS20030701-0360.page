Chapters 8-10 tell us about the accomplishments of </div><div class="t m4f8 x4b he y688 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Jesus. However, the author had to show that Jesus is the legitimate </div><div class="t m4f9 x4b he y17f ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Priest, even though He was not a Levite. Therefore, in Hebrews 7, the </div><div class="t m47 x4b he y689 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">author pointed to the priesthood of Melchizedek, which foreshad-</div><div class="t m455 x4b he y180 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">owed Christ&apos;s priesthood, and to Psalm 110, which predicted Christ&apos;s </div><div class="t m8a x4b he y68a ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">priesthood. He did this in order to show that although Jesus was not a </div><div class="t m4fa x4b he yeb ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Levite, still a new priest, from the order of Melchizedek, was to </div><div class="t m188 x4b he y353 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">come. In chapter 8, he then related the promise of a covenant that </div><div class="t m70 x4b he y181 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">required a </div><div class="t m122 x67 he y181 ff6 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">new and better priesthood </div><div class="t m2f3 x31 he y181 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and a new and better sanctuary. </div><div class="t ma8 x4b he y2cf ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">This, of course, refers to Jesus and His ministry in heaven. </div><div class="t m21c x38 hd y357 ff5 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Read Hebrews 13:20 and 8:6.

Why were these terms used? </div><div class="t m4fb x4a he y187 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Though a sharp contrast is portrayed between the old and new </div><div class="t m4fc x4b he y188 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">covenant, some elements of continuity exist between both. The part-</div><div class="t m43f x4b he y189 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ners in both covenants are the same: God and His respective people. </div><div class="t m4fd x4b he y18a ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">In both cases, God takes the initiative; He alone saves. In both there </div><div class="t m1b3 x4b he y18b ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">are promises, and there are duties. And, certainly, in both, the pres-</div><div class="t m1b9 x4b he y18c ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ence of God amid His people is paramount. </div><div class="t m311 x4a he y18d ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The main, and crucial difference, between the old and new cov-</div><div class="t m379 x4b he y18e ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">enant is that there is now total forgiveness and assurance.

In the new covenant, the law is now internal-</div><div class="t m4fe x4b he y190 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ized, and through faith in Christ, the believer lives in obedience to the </div><div class="t ma8 x4b he y191 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">law, now written in the heart. The new covenant is permanent; it has </div><div class="t m4e4 x4b he y35e ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">been ratified, not with the blood of an animal but with the blood of </div><div class="t m95 x4b he y35f ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Jesus. And, finally, if in the old covenant people found hope in the </div><div class="t m4ff x30 he y68b ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">blood of a goat or a lamb or a bull, how much more hope do we have </div><div class="t m47d x4b he y360 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in the blood of Jesus Christ?
