Chapters 8-10 tell us about the accomplishments of </div><div class="t m4f8 x4a hc y687 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Jesus. However, the author had to show that Jesus is the legitimate </div><div class="t m4f9 x4a hc y17e ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Priest, even though He was not a Levite. Therefore, in Hebrews 7, the </div><div class="t m47 x4a hc y688 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">author pointed to the priesthood of Melchizedek, which foreshad-</div><div class="t m455 x4a hc y17f ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">owed Christ&apos;s priesthood, and to Psalm 110, which predicted Christ&apos;s </div><div class="t m8a x4a hc y689 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">priesthood.

In chapter 8, he then related the promise of a covenant that </div><div class="t m70 x4a hc y180 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">required a </div><div class="t m122 x66 hc y180 ff6 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">new and better priesthood </div><div class="t m2f3 x30 hc y180 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and a new and better sanctuary. </div><div class="t ma8 x4a hc y2ce ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">This, of course, refers to Jesus and His ministry in heaven. </div><div class="t m21c x37 hb y356 ff5 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Read Hebrews 13:20 and 8:6.

In both there </div><div class="t m1b3 x4a hc y18a ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">are promises, and there are duties.
