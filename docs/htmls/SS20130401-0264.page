He had no special interest in religion. </div><div class="t m0 x63 h34 y370 ff10 fs3 fc3 sc0 ls2 ws11f">Then his cousin invited him to attend his church, and Mandela realized </div><div class="t m0 x63 h34 y371 ff10 fs3 fc3 sc0 ls2 ws15c">that God wanted to be part of his life. He bought a Bible and began </div><div class="t m0 x63 h34 y372 ff10 fs3 fc3 sc0 ls2 ws81">reading it. Questions arose in his mind that his cousin’s pastor couldn’t </div><div class="t m0 x63 h34 y373 ff10 fs3 fc3 sc0 ls2 ws5">answer, so Mandela searched elsewhere for answers.</div><div class="t m0 x13 h34 y374 ff10 fs3 fc3 sc0 ls2 ws15d">He discovered a religious television station and began watching it. </div><div class="t m0 x63 h34 y375 ff10 fs3 fc3 sc0 ls2 ws12b">A sermon on prophecy caught his interest. He was impressed that the </div><div class="t m0 x63 h34 y376 ff10 fs3 fc3 sc0 ls2 ws38">speaker’s message was based on the Bible. Mandela read each Bible text </div><div class="t m0 x63 h34 y377 ff10 fs3 fc3 sc0 ls2 ws5">for himself and was convinced that the words were from God. </div><div class="t m0 x13 h34 y378 ff10 fs3 fc3 sc0 ls2 ws15e">One evening the speaker talked about how the Sabbath had been </div><div class="t m0 x63 h34 y379 ff10 fs3 fc3 sc0 ls2 ws23">changed to Sunday long after Jesus had died and rose again. Mandela real<span class="ws4">-</span></div><div class="t m0 x63 h34 y37a ff10 fs3 fc3 sc0 ls2 ws7d">ized that the Sabbath wasn’t Sunday but Saturday. He told his boss that he </div><div class="t m0 x63 h34 y37b ff10 fs3 fc3 sc0 ls2 ws32">would no longer work on Saturdays. But because he knew of no church </div><div class="t m0 x63 h34 y37c ff10 fs3 fc3 sc0 ls2 wsd7">that worshiped on the Sabbath, he rested at home that day and worshiped </div><div class="t m0 x63 h34 y37d ff10 fs3 fc3 sc0 ls2 ws5">with his cousin on Sundays. </div><div class="t m0 x13 h34 y37e ff10 fs3 fc3 sc0 ls2 wsb7">When Mandela realized that the station was affiliated with Seventh-day </div><div class="t m0 x63 h34 y37f ff10 fs3 fc3 sc0 ls2 wsd4">Adventists, he found a church in town. On Sabbath morning he got up </div><div class="t m0 x63 h34 y380 ff10 fs3 fc3 sc0 ls2 wse5">early, eager to celebrate the Sabbath in God’s house.
