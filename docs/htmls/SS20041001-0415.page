He lived with his grandmother in Kenya </div><div class="t m229 x17 ha y203 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">until she died. Then he was taken to his great-aunt&apos;s home to live. When </div><div class="t m22a x17 ha y204 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">life became unbearable, George ran away. He was 9 years old.

The pro-</div><div class="t m230 x17 ha y20d ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">gram included a spiritual talk. This was the first time some of the children </div><div class="t m231 x17 ha y20e ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">had heard about Jesus. Then the children played games together. </div><div class="t m232 x50 ha y20f ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">George heard shouts and laughter as he sifted through the trash for food. </div><div class="t m4b x17 ha y210 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Curious, he went closer. </div><div class="t m233 x80 ha y210 ff2 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Wow, </div><div class="t m234 x81 ha y210 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">he thought, </div><div class="t m5c x5d ha y210 ff2 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">those kids look sharp in their </div><div class="t m235 x17 ha y211 ff2 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">uniforms. </div><div class="t m236 x73 ha y211 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Someone invited George to join in the fun.

Good food replaced garbage scraps, and he slept on a mat in a </div><div class="t m23e x1a ha y21c ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">warm room, not on the sidewalk. He no longer had to run away when a </div><div class="t m23f x82 ha y21d ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">police officer came by. </div><div class="t m15b x50 ha y21e ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;I am so happy,&quot; George said. &quot;Life is good; I can go to school.&quot; George </div><div class="t m240 x1a ha y21f ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">has joined the baptismal class.
