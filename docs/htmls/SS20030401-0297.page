A truck </div><div class="t m36c x52 h14 y311 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">loaded with passengers approached, and Drick&apos;s eyes focused on a </div><div class="t m6b9 x3d h14 y78f ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">man carrying a hand bag. Waving a gun, he jumped out of the </div><div class="t me3 x52 h14 y313 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">shadows, snatched the bag from the man, and disappeared before </div><div class="t m66c x52 h14 y314 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">anyone could stop him. </div><div class="t mb6 x2c h14 y790 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The bag was heavy and fat. &quot;It must be full of bank notes,&quot; Drick </div><div class="t m6ba x3d h14 y27d ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">told his friend as they made their escape. &quot;This should keep us going </div><div class="t m6bb x3d h14 y315 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">for a while!&quot; When the men were sure that no one was following them, </div><div class="t m6bc x3d h14 y316 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">they stopped to open the bag. &quot;What? Is this all I got?&quot; Drick cried in </div><div class="t m6bd x3d h14 y791 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">disgust as he pulled a large black book from the bag. He lit a match and </div><div class="t m6be x3d h14 y318 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">held it close to read the title on the cover: B-I-B-L-E. &quot;This is of no use </div><div class="t m6bf x3d h14 y319 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to me!&quot; he grunted, and he touched the match to the book. </div><div class="t m6c0 x2c h14 y31a ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Don&apos;t burn it!&quot; his friend warned. &quot;Maybe there&apos;s something </div><div class="t mb4 x3d h14 y792 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">valuable inside.&quot; </div><div class="t m6c1 x19 h14 y31c ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Drick shoved the book into the bag and started for home. When he </div><div class="t m4a0 x3d h14 y793 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">arrived, he tossed the Bible onto a shelf and quickly forgot about it. </div><div class="t m680 x19 h14 y31e ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">One night he returned home and found his wife reading the black </div><div class="t m6c2 x3d h14 y20 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">book. &quot;Listen to this,&quot; she told him. &quot;This is really interesting.&quot; </div><div class="t m4b1 x19 h14 y31f ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Drick frowned as his wife began reading from John 3. The words </div><div class="t m6c3 x3d h14 y320 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">caught his attention. They spoke of God&apos;s love. </div><div class="t m6c4 x8e h14 y320 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Does God really love </div><div class="t m6c5 x3d h14 y321 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">me, a thief? </div><div class="t m5b0 x70 h14 y321 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">he wondered.

But always he felt thirsty to know more. </div><div class="t m423 x19 h14 y325 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">One day he heard about a man named Sen Marak, who knew his </div><div class="t m678 x18 h14 y56 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Bible. He visited Sen and asked many questions. Sen offered to study </div><div class="t m34 x18 h14 y794 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the Bible with him, and Drick agreed. As the men studied together, </div><div class="t m43f x18 h14 y2b ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Drick had the feeling that he had seen Sen somewhere before. But </div><div class="t m6c9 x18 h14 y779 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">where? Suddenly he remembered—Drick had robbed this man.
