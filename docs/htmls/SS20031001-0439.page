When I was </div><div class="t m91 x1e h19 y472 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">about 14 years of age, I often saw my grandma going to church. </div><div class="t m29f x1e h19 y473 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Sometimes I went with her, and eventually I signed up to attend </div><div class="t m218 x1e h19 y474 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">some religious classes that were being held in the church. But to </div><div class="t m353 x1e h19 y1e5 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">be frank, I could not understand most of what they taught there. </div><div class="t m400 x11 h19 y282 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">During my second year of high school a friend invited my </div><div class="t mcf x1e h19 y475 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">group of friends—there were five of us—to his chruch. We had </div><div class="t m394 x1e h19 y476 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">never heard of this church, but we decided to go. I thought the </div><div class="t m401 x1e h19 y477 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">services were weird because they were so different from my </div><div class="t m232 x1e h19 y478 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">grandmother&apos;s church. But I really liked the Sabbath School class </div><div class="t m1b8 x1e h19 y479 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">with so many people taking part in the discussion, teaching and </div><div class="t mc1 x1e h19 y47a ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">learning together about the Bible lesson. </div><div class="t m276 x11 h19 y1ed ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">For awhile I attended this church occasionally, then started </div><div class="t m3e7 x1e h19 y287 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">going every week. When I went, I felt a peace in my heart that I </div><div class="t mb8 x1e h19 y47b ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">could not understand. I got to know everybody, and I felt as if I </div><div class="t m2d1 x1e h19 y47c ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">were part of a large Christian family. </div><div class="t m402 x11 h19 y47d ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Some church members encouraged me to take my stand for </div><div class="t m23b x1e h19 y47e ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Christ and be baptized, but I was not ready yet. I did not know a lot </div><div class="t m15f x9 h19 y47f ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">about God&apos;s Word, and I was not sure about some things. Besides, </div><div class="t m1ad x9 h19 y480 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I had problems at home. </div><div class="t m15c x11 h19 y481 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">From the beginning my family opposed my going to this church. </div><div class="t mbc x9 h19 y482 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">They insisted that the only true church was the Orthodox church, </div><div class="t m2f1 x9 h19 y483 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and they tried every way they knew to help me find my way back </div><div class="t m236 x9 h19 y484 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to the family&apos;s religion. I knew they wanted what was best for me, </div><div class="t m403 x9 h19 y485 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">but I was convinced that I had found what was best. Sometimes we </div><div class="t m404 x9 h19 y486 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">argued, and they tried to convince me that I was wrong. And </div><div class="t m405 x9 h19 y487 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sometimes I tried to convince them that they were wrong. Some </div><div class="t me8 x9 h19 y488 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Sabbaths were peaceful; others were full of arguing. After some </div><div class="t mb5 x44 h19 y489 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">time, however, they gave up trying to change my mind. </div><div class="t m406 x2b h19 y293 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">My knowledge of God was increasing, and I felt the Holy Spirit </div><div class="t m31 x44 h19 y48a ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">very close to me.
