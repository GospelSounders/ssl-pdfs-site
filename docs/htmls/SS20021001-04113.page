H. Zachary </div><div class="t m77e x43 h20 y7f8 ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Rathna was a carpenter living with his wife and young daughter in a </div><div class="t mce x4 h20 y7f9 ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">small village in North Andhra, India. Then the couple&apos;s three-year-old </div><div class="t m12c x4 h20 y161 ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">daughter fell seriously ill, and they took her to several doctors for </div><div class="t m370 x42 h20 y162 ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">treatment. But the doctors gave them no hope. &quot;Your daughter will not </div><div class="t m726 x42 h20 y7fc ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">live for more than a week,&quot; they said. The couple turned to their Hindu </div><div class="t m305 x42 h20 y7fd ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">priests for help, but the priests could offer no hope for the child either. </div><div class="t m3fc x43 h20 y7fe ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Then the couple remembered Ludian, who had visited the village </div><div class="t m43d x42 h20 y7ff ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and told the people about Jesus. Some said that when Ludian prayed, </div><div class="t m534 x42 h20 y758 ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Jesus healed them. </div><div class="t m3f7 x43 h20 y801 ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The couple took their little girl to Ludian&apos;s home in a distant village. </div><div class="t m311 x42 h20 y759 ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">As Ludian prayed, the child seemed to improve slightly. Ludian told </div><div class="t m4e7 x42 h20 y75a ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the couple to fast and pray to Jesus for three days, and their daughter </div><div class="t m1d1 x42 h20 y75b ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">would be healed. The couple fasted and prayed for five days. They </div><div class="t m306 x42 h20 y803 ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">rejoiced when their daughter was completely healed. </div><div class="t m1b8 x43 h20 yad5 ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">A short time later Ludian, the wife of a Protestant pastor, held </div><div class="t m257 x42 h20 y804 ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">evangelistic meetings in their town. The couple attended every night </div><div class="t m50b x42 h20 yad6 ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and accepted Jesus as their Savior in response to Ludian&apos;s invitation. </div><div class="t m155 x43 h20 y806 ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">They were deeply in love with Jesus and began sharing their faith </div><div class="t m5ac x42 h20 yad7 ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">with others. A Protestant pastor urged them to work full time for God </div><div class="t m6e3 x42 h20 yad8 ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and start a Christian church in their village. </div><div class="t m742 x43 h20 y815 ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Rathna began sharing God&apos;s love with his neighbors. Their testi-</div><div class="t m354 x42 h20 y794 ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">mony of the power of Jesus was a powerful influence in their village. </div><div class="t m48e x44 h20 yad9 ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Within a few months they had raised up a congregation of 80 members. </div><div class="t m413 x44 h20 yada ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The pastor and his congregation worked and prayed for three years to </div><div class="t m499 x44 h20 yadb ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">build a church. </div><div class="t m361 x43 h20 y75c ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">One day an Adventist naturopath visited homes in Rathna&apos;s village </div><div class="t m73c x44 h20 y75d ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and met the pastor. The doctor began visiting Rathna and slowly </div><div class="t m643 x44 h20 yadc ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">revealed further Bible truth. Rathna was amazed that he had never </div><div class="t m32d x44 h20 y75f ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">noticed the biblical command to keep the Sabbath holy. The doctor led </div><div class="t m348 x44 h20 yadd ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">them into greater truth, and early in 2000 the couple was baptized. </div><div class="t m50c x45 h20 y81c ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The Rathnas invite members of their church to study with them and </div><div class="t m7bc x44 h20 y818 ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">keep the Sabbath.
