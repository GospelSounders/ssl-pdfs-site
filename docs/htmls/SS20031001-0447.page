H. Zachary </div><div class="t m285 x21 h19 y4ff ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Josue Mpwatsibenikanka was raised in an idol-worshiping family </div><div class="t m480 x70 h19 y259 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in southern Rwanda. When he heard the call of Christ and followed </div><div class="t m25d x70 h19 y45 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Him, his family persecuted him. </div><div class="t m481 x21 h19 y500 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">During the Rwandan civil war soldiers accused him of collaborating </div><div class="t m3f1 x70 h19 y25d ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">with the &quot;enemy.&quot; They were about to execute him when a soldier </div><div class="t m482 x70 h19 y137 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">standing on a hill nearby called out, &quot;We have more traitors over here.&quot; </div><div class="t m4 x1e h19 y246 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">When the soldiers ran toward the hill, Josue escaped. In gratitude to God </div><div class="t m483 x1e h19 y501 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">he promised that for the rest of his life he would work for God. Although </div><div class="t m484 x1e h19 y25e ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">he had been a farmer, he became a literature evangelist. </div><div class="t m485 x11 h19 y25f ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Josue and a friend were concerned that there were no </div><div class="t m37c x1e h19 y260 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Sabbathkeepers in a village near their own. Josue visited every home </div><div class="t m2b6 x1e h19 y261 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in the village and gave interested people a small gift book. Later he </div><div class="t m1f7 x1e h19 y502 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">returned and sold many copies of </div><div class="t m486 x98 h19 y262 ff3 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The Great Controversy. </div><div class="t m375 x11 h19 y13e ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">In Rwandan churches music is an important part of the worship </div><div class="t m487 x1e h19 y263 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">experience, and every church has at least one choir. Members often </div><div class="t m488 x1e h19 y264 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">spend several hours on Sabbath afternoons enjoying the music of their </div><div class="t m489 x1e h19 y265 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">choirs. So Josue and his friend began inviting choirs from nearby </div><div class="t m48a x1e h19 y266 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Adventist churches to sing for their targeted village. Crowds came out </div><div class="t m1ea x1e h19 y503 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to listen. </div><div class="t m48b x11 h19 y504 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">As interest grew, the two men began teaching the Bible in connec-</div><div class="t m65 x1e h19 y268 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tion with the choral programs. They spent many days visiting the </div><div class="t m48c x1e h19 y148 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">homes of people who had come to hear the choirs. As they opened the </div><div class="t m48d x1e h19 y250 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">scriptures and prayed with these families, attendance at the concerts </div><div class="t m48e x1e h19 y404 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and Bible studies grew. </div><div class="t m340 x11 h19 y505 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Each evening they would close their Bible study with a call to </div><div class="t m48f x9 h19 y269 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">accept Jesus and follow Him in a new life. This community had lost </div><div class="t m490 x9 h19 y26a ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">many during the civil war that ravaged Rwanda. The survivors were </div><div class="t m491 x9 h19 y26b ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">seeking comfort and spiritual support. Bible studies on the return of </div><div class="t m492 x9 h19 y26c ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Jesus and the glorious resurrection encouraged people to respond to </div><div class="t m370 x9 h19 y26d ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the call to come to Jesus. </div><div class="t mb x11 h19 y26e ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Soon Josue and his friend began Sabbath services with about 40 </div><div class="t m16b x9 h19 y26f ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">persons. However, after he had canvassed every home in the village </div><div class="t m2c5 x9 h19 y270 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and the nearby area, his work took him to another community. He </div><div class="t m8c x9 h19 y506 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">asked one of the elders from a nearby congregation to lead the new </div><div class="t m493 x9 h19 y272 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">group. </div><div class="t m28b x2b h19 y6e ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Josue continues to work in this region praying for more persons </div><div class="t m494 x9 h19 y507 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">whom he can lead to Jesus. </div><div class="t m495 x2b h3e y508 ff6 fs24 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">J.
