She </div><div class="t m264 x2 h16 y13f ff4 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">may have retired from teaching school, but not from teaching </div><div class="t m61 x2 h16 y140 ff4 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">others about Christ. Born into a Christian family, her father and </div><div class="t m152 x2 h16 y141 ff4 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">uncle were among the first to become Adventists in her home </div><div class="t m3a x2 h16 y142 ff4 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">village. She married and bore six children before her husband died </div><div class="t m5af x2 h16 y143 ff4 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">at age 28. </div><div class="t m6d0 x55 h16 yae4 ff4 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Wu Lan taught school in a remote mountain area to support her </div><div class="t m612 x2 h16 y145 ff4 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">young family, retiring in 1979 to devote her time to working for </div><div class="t m5fe x2 h16 yae5 ff4 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">he Lord in her community. And her efforts have born fruit in </div><div class="t m90 x2 h16 yae6 ff4 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tremendous growth in the Adventist church in that area. </div><div class="t m162 x55 h16 y147 ff4 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">She moved to an area where she was the only Adventist. She </div><div class="t m237 x2 h16 y148 ff4 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">began worships in her home. Soon neighbors began to join her for </div><div class="t m3d7 x2 h16 yae7 ff4 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">worship. Within a year more than 100 people were attending the </div><div class="t m3e0 x2 h16 y398 ff4 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">house church. </div><div class="t m4bd x55 h16 y149 ff4 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">People began asking for Bible studies and baptism. This pre-</div><div class="t m200 x4 h16 y14a ff4 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sented a problem, for there were no Adventist pastors or elders in </div><div class="t m447 x2 h16 y14b ff4 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the area. The only pastors authorized to baptize were from the </div><div class="t m6d1 x4 h16 y14c ff4 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">official Three-Self church. And baptism by one of these pastors </div><div class="t m300 x4 h16 y14d ff4 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">meant joining the Three-Self church. </div><div class="t m34e x55 h16 y14e ff4 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">After prayerful searching, Wu Lan decided to baptize them </div><div class="t m5a5 x4 h16 yae8 ff4 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">herself. So far Sister Wu has baptized more than 800 people into </div><div class="t m6d2 x4 h16 y150 ff4 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the Seventh-day Adventist Church. She has established six churches, </div><div class="t m36b x4 h16 yae9 ff4 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">including one with about 500 members in the next province, and </div><div class="t m4bc x4 h16 y152 ff4 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">more than 10 house worship groups in the area, </div><div class="t m206 x55 h16 y153 ff4 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The church in Sister Wu&apos;s area has continued to grow in size </div><div class="t m3ab x4 h16 y154 ff4 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and strength, and now has more than 2,000 members. Four laymen </div><div class="t m491 x4 h16 y39c ff4 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">have been trained and ordained as local elders, and another 12 </div><div class="t m48e x4 h16 y156 ff4 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">have trained to become deacons. Thus Sister Wu now has spiritual </div><div class="t m73 x4 h16 y157 ff4 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">leaders to assist her. But so far she has not slowed down in her </div><div class="t m214 x4 h16 yaea ff4 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">work for God. </div><div class="t m43f x12 h16 y159 ff4 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;I don&apos;t pay any attention to what people say.
