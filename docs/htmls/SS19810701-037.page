First, memories are weak, and we need to </div><div class="t m86 x1 he y86 ff1 fs5 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">refresh our knowledge. Second, we are expected to grow in knowledge, and so we </div><div class="t m87 x1 he y87 ff1 fs5 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">need to restudy our faith in order to enlarge our understanding of it. Third, biblical </div><div class="t m88 x1 he y88 ff1 fs5 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">truth is of so rich a nature that fresh glimpses of its wealth always await our discovery. </div><div class="t m89 x1 he y89 ff1 fs5 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Fourth, while the substance of truth does not change, the form in which it is cast and </div><div class="t m8a x1 he y8a ff1 fs5 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the appeal that it makes need study from time to time to keep them relevant to the time </div><div class="t m8b x1 he y8b ff1 fs5 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and place where truth is taught. But jewels that are reset do not change their nature </div><div class="t m8c x1 he y8c ff1 fs5 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">though their value may be increased. So it is with truth. After all, God has adapted His </div><div class="t m8d x1 he y8d ff1 fs5 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">teachings to the constantly changing human scene—from the Garden of Eden to the </div><div class="t m8e x1 he y8e ff1 fs5 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">advent movement and modern times. </div><div class="t m8f x41 he y8f ff1 fs5 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">On a much smaller scale, each generation of Adventists must take a fresh look at its </div><div class="t m90 x1 he y90 ff1 fs5 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">beliefs, applying them to local circumstances and expressing them to meet contem-</div><div class="t m26 x1 he y91 ff1 fs5 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">porary needs. Such study does not yield to unbelief; indeed it provides an opportunity </div><div class="t m91 x1 he y92 ff1 fs5 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to strengthen faith in eternal truths. </div><div class="t m92 x41 he y93 ff1 fs5 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Let us consider one more reason for a fresh look at some of our major beliefs. When </div><div class="t m93 x1 he y94 ff1 fs5 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">we first accepted them, they probably came through another person. We need to </div><div class="t m94 x1 he y95 ff1 fs5 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">make them our own by means of mature study. By regular, thoughtful attention to </div><div class="t m95 x1 he y96 ff1 fs5 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Scripture we can make each doctrine an expression of our own conviction on that </div><div class="t m96 x1 he y97 ff1 fs5 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">subject. We can thus gain a deeply personal faith that is founded on a rich under-</div><div class="t m97 x1 he y98 ff1 fs5 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">standing of the Bible and a closer fellowship with the Father; Son, and Holy Spirit. </div><div class="t m98 x1 he y59 ff1 fs5 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">And while we are studying, we should remember that our God expects us to serve Him </div><div class="t m99 x1 he y99 ff1 fs5 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">with all our mind as well as with our other abilities. It has been said that the duty to use </div><div class="t m9a x1 he y9a ff1 fs5 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">our intelligence is. a moral duty, especially in the area of religious knowledge. </div><div class="t m9b x1 he y9b ff1 fs5 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Carrying out that duty may spell the difference between life and death! </div><div class="t m9c x41 he y9c ff1 fs5 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Two quarters&apos; Sabbath School lessons (as we shall have) will not suffice for a </div><div class="t m9d x1 he y9d ff1 fs5 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">survey of all the doctrines of the Seventh-day Adventist Church; so we have to choose </div><div class="t m9e x1 he y9e ff1 fs5 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">some and leave others. The very act of selection may help to underline those teach-</div><div class="t m9f x1 he y9f ff1 fs5 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ings that we see as most necessary for the 1980s. Similarly with the choice of </div><div class="t ma0 x1 he ya0 ff1 fs5 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">supporting verses—it may stimulate us to find varied scriptural support for beliefs we </div><div class="t ma1 x1 he ya1 ff1 fs5 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">hold dear. </div><div class="t ma2 x41 he ya2 ff1 fs5 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Finally, and most important of all, there is the need to apply each article of faith to </div><div class="t ma3 x1 he ya3 ff1 fs5 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">our way of living. Unless this is done, we are merely collecting lifeless theological </div><div class="t ma4 x1 he ya4 ff1 fs5 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">declarations that become as dry as the proverbial hills of Gilboa. It is our act of </div><div class="t ma5 x1 he ya5 ff1 fs5 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">applying that gives the Holy Spirit the opportunity to breathe anew into each doctrine </div><div class="t ma6 x1 he ya6 ff1 fs5 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the breath of life that brings a change in our lives. There is not one biblical teaching </div><div class="t ma7 x1 he ya7 ff1 fs5 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that does not require personal application to make it come alive for each of us; and </div><div class="t m67 x1 he ya8 ff1 fs5 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">there is not one, no matter how difficult or even theoretical it may appear, that will not </div><div class="t ma8 x1 he ya9 ff1 fs5 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">bring spiritual life to them that accept and apply it in daily living. </div><div class="t ma9 x41 he yaa ff1 fs5 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Therefore, in the words of the most famous of all citizens of Tarsus: &quot;Keep before </div><div class="t m63 x1 he yab ff1 fs5 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">you an outline of the sound teaching which you heard from me, living by the faith and </div><div class="t maa x1 he y39 ff1 fs5 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">love which are ours in Christ Jesus. Guard the treasure put into our charge, with the </div><div class="t mab x1 he yac ff1 fs5 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">help of the Holy Spirit dwelling within us&quot; (2 Tim. 1:14, NEB). Then with confidence </div><div class="t mac x1 he yad ff1 fs5 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">we shall be able to proclaim, &quot;This we believe!&quot; </div><div class="t mad x42 h10 yae ff2 fs5 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">7 </div></div><div class="pi" data-data='{"ctm":[1.000000,0.000000,0.000000,1.000000,0.000000,0.000000]}'></div></div>
