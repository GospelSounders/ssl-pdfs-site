This lack of mention does not suggest that they were of no </div><div class="t m1ae x65 h21 y1bf ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">help to Paul, but their contact with Paul was risky and they may have </div><div class="t m1af x5 h21 y1c0 ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">been in a position that made it extremely dangerous for them to associate </div><div class="t m183 x5 h21 y1c1 ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">openly with a condemned criminal. Nevertheless their being mentioned </div><div class="t m4c x5 h21 y1c2 ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">by name further emphasizes the longing that Paul felt for Timothy. It </div><div class="t m1b0 x5 h21 y1c3 ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">seems that the fear that the journey might take too long—for bad weather </div><div class="t m1b1 x5 h21 y1c4 ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">could delay sailings from Ephesus to Rome—and that Paul might die be-</div><div class="t m1b2 x5 h21 y1c5 ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">fore Timothy&apos;s arrival, prompted the writing of the second epistle. Paul&apos;s </div><div class="t m1b3 x5 h21 y1c6 ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">earnest plea stresses once more the affection which was more intimite </div><div class="t m1b4 x5 h21 y1c7 ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">than his friendship with Linus and the others. Nevertheless these four </div><div class="t mc x5 h21 y1c8 ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">named believers belonged also to the Christian family and can be counted </div><div class="t m1b5 x5 h21 y1c9 ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">among that vast unnamed legion of faithful believers in Christ. Whether </div><div class="t m18a x5 h21 y1ca ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Timothy was able to reach Rome before Paul&apos;s death is not made clear in </div><div class="t m17e x5 h21 y1cb ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the Bible. But it seems obvious that Paul anticipated that Timothy would </div><div class="t m1b6 x5 h21 y1cc ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">make every effort to do so as a loyal, loving, and obedient son. </div><div class="t m1b7 x66 h22 y1cd ff6 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">What connection is there between love, duty, and obedience? John 15:14, </div><div class="t m1b8 x5 h22 y1ce ff6 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">15; 13:35. </div><div class="t m1b9 x46 h21 y1cf ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The servant is in the house to obey orders and to carry out the wishes </div><div class="t m1ba x5 h21 y1d0 ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of his master. He does not know what course to take without being told </div><div class="t m1bb x5 h21 y1d1 ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">because he is not part of the family. The son, however, is part of the </div><div class="t m173 x5 h21 y1d2 ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">household. He knows its ins and outs. He not only has authority subject </div><div class="t m1ba x5 h21 y7b ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to his father, but wisdom to act in an emergency because he is aware of </div><div class="t m1bc x5 h21 y1d3 ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">his father&apos;s intentions, and acts as he thinks his father would act. In the </div><div class="t m1bd x5 h21 y1d4 ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">same way, members of God&apos;s family know His will and perform it be-</div><div class="t m1be x5 h21 y1d5 ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">cause they are part of the household.

A life devoted to such </div><div class="t m1c2 x5 h21 y1d8 ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">deeds calls attention to itself, not in an egocentric way, but because of its </div><div class="t m1c3 x5 h21 y1d9 ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">uniqueness. To show love toward the unlovely, to minister kindness to </div><div class="t m146 x5 h21 y1da ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the ungrateful, to grant rights to the unlawful and the selfish are marks of </div><div class="t m13 x5 h21 y1db ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">true nobility. Through such unselfish actions the true followers of Christ </div><div class="t m1c4 x5 h21 y1dc ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">demonstrate an attitude that will be noted by unbelievers. Such acts as </div><div class="t m1c5 x5 h21 y1dd ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">praying for our enemies and helping those who defraud and steal from us </div><div class="t m1c6 x7c h21 y1de ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">give evidence that we are following the pattern of One who laid down His </div><div class="t m1c7 x5 h21 y1df ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">life for those who despised, rejected, tortured, and crucified Him.
