(See 1 Cor. 12:31.) Refer to the chart under section II of the </div><div class="t m342 x2d ha yf6 ff4 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">lesson to review the way Paul ranks the gifts. One reason why he does so is </div><div class="t m343 x2d ha yf7 ff4 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to demonstrate that the tongues phenomenon that was taking place in the </div><div class="t m344 x8 ha yf8 ff4 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Corinthian church should not be given undue importance. (See chapter 14.) </div><div class="t m154 x5 ha yf9 ff4 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Notice that when it comes to the gift of tongues, it rates rather low on the </div><div class="t m139 x2d ha yfa ff4 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">scale of importance Paul assigns.

He then explains in 1 Corinthians 13 that none of the gifts </div><div class="t m347 x2d ha yfd ff4 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">have real value unless they are combined with the gift of love. That Paul is </div><div class="t m348 x2d ha y3b9 ff4 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">not referring to sentimental or natural human love becomes quite clear in his </div><div class="t m13d x2d ha yff ff4 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">development of chapter 13. </div><div class="t m18f x8 hd y3ba ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">COMPARE Paul&apos;s lists of what love is and what it is not in 1 Corinthi-</div><div class="t m349 x2d hd y103 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ans 13 in order to understand more fully the kind of love about which he </div><div class="t m34a x8 hd y3bb ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">is talking.
