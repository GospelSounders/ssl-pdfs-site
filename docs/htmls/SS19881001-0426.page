(See 1 Cor. 12:31.) Refer to the chart under section II of the </div><div class="t m342 x2c h7 yf5 ff4 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">lesson to review the way Paul ranks the gifts. One reason why he does so is </div><div class="t m343 x2c h7 yf6 ff4 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to demonstrate that the tongues phenomenon that was taking place in the </div><div class="t m344 x7 h7 yf7 ff4 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Corinthian church should not be given undue importance. (See chapter 14.) </div><div class="t m154 x4 h7 yf8 ff4 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Notice that when it comes to the gift of tongues, it rates rather low on the </div><div class="t m139 x2c h7 yf9 ff4 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">scale of importance Paul assigns. Instead of condemning the manifestation </div><div class="t m345 x7 h7 y3b7 ff4 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of tongues in Corinth, Paul points out that there is a &quot;more excellent way&quot; </div><div class="t m346 x2c h7 yfb ff4 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">(1 Cor. 12:31). He then explains in 1 Corinthians 13 that none of the gifts </div><div class="t m347 x2c h7 yfc ff4 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">have real value unless they are combined with the gift of love. That Paul is </div><div class="t m348 x2c h7 y3b8 ff4 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">not referring to sentimental or natural human love becomes quite clear in his </div><div class="t m13d x2c h7 yfe ff4 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">development of chapter 13. </div><div class="t m18f x7 ha y3b9 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">COMPARE Paul&apos;s lists of what love is and what it is not in 1 Corinthi-</div><div class="t m349 x2c ha y102 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ans 13 in order to understand more fully the kind of love about which he </div><div class="t m34a x7 ha y3ba ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">is talking.
