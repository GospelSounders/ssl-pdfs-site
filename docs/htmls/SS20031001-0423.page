H. Zachary </div><div class="t m1b2 x10 hf y2d3 ff2 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">When Galina Veretennikova was 18 years old an Adventist pastor </div><div class="t m2bb x8 hf y2d4 ff2 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">lived next door. Several times she watched as the secret police came </div><div class="t m12d x8 hf y2d5 ff2 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to the pastor&apos;s home. She saw home meetings broken up. </div><div class="t m2a7 x84 hf y2d5 ff3 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Why would </div><div class="t m13b x8 hf y2d6 ff3 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the police do this to these lovely people? </div><div class="t m135 x24 hf y2d7 ff2 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">she wondered. </div><div class="t m2bc x10 hf y2d8 ff2 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Galina graduated with a degree in electronics and became attrac-</div><div class="t m8f x8 hf y2d9 ff2 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tive to the communist officials. Little by little she gained their confi-</div><div class="t mde x8 hf y2da ff2 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">dence until she became a member of the communist governing body </div><div class="t m6e x8 hf y2db ff2 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">for the entire province in which she lived in the former Soviet Union. </div><div class="t m1a9 x10 hf y2dc ff2 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">She enjoyed the position. Everyone knew her. She also had a good </div><div class="t m2bd x8 hf y2dd ff2 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">job and good income. Everything seemed to be going her way. </div><div class="t m25e x2a hf y2de ff2 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">During all this time Galina&apos;s Adventist neighbor befriended her and </div><div class="t m2be x8 hf y14 ff2 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">her family. Pastor Bolebrukh shared his joy in the Lord with Galina. In </div><div class="t m2bf x8 hf y2df ff2 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">her heart she knew that he was telling the truth, but pressures from the </div><div class="t m5 x8 hf y2e0 ff2 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">popular church officials in town kept her from acting upon her under-</div><div class="t mc9 x8 hf y2e1 ff2 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">standing of truth. She did not want to become associated with a &quot;cult.&quot; </div><div class="t m2c0 x2a hf y2e2 ff2 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">When Galina&apos;s daughter turned 18, she suddenly disappeared. </div><div class="t m2c1 x8 hf y2e3 ff2 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Galina asked the local police to search for her, but the girl was not </div><div class="t m2c2 x43 hf y2e4 ff2 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">found. Galina asked the secret police to help her find her daughter, but </div><div class="t m2c3 x43 hf y2e5 ff2 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">they turned up no clues. Next Galina turned to her church. Frequently, </div><div class="t m2c4 x43 hf y2e6 ff2 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">she went to pray for her daughter. But still no one turned up any sign of </div><div class="t m2c5 x43 hf y8b ff2 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">her daughter. </div><div class="t m278 x2a hf y2e7 ff2 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">One day her neighbor invited Galina to attend a Bible seminar that </div><div class="t m2c6 x43 hf y2e8 ff2 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was being conducted in the local palace of culture. At first she refused. </div><div class="t m30 x43 hf y2e9 ff2 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">She still thought that this group was a cult. But finally she agreed to go </div><div class="t m148 x71 hf y2ea ff2 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">\v ith her neighbor. One of the lessons dealt with prayer. </div><div class="t m2c7 x2a hf y2eb ff2 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Galina asked the group to pray for her daughter, who by then had </div><div class="t m2c8 x71 hf y2ec ff2 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">been missing for two years. Galina found comfort in the earnest </div><div class="t m2c9 x71 hf y2ed ff2 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">prayers that her new friends offered for her daughter&apos;s safe return. </div><div class="t m29b x5b hf y93 ff2 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Fwo hours after Galina returned home from the meeting, she heard a </div><div class="t m2ca x71 hf y2b ff2 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">knock at her door. She unbolted the door and found her daughter </div><div class="t m2cb x43 hf y2ee ff2 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">standing there. </div><div class="t m2cc x4b hf y2ef ff2 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Galina learned that her daughter had been taken by force to another </div><div class="t m2cd x71 hf y2f0 ff2 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">country. She managed to escape and return home, even without </div><div class="t m2ce x71 hf y2f1 ff2 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">money or passport. Galina realized that God had begun to answer her </div><div class="t m18e x71 hf y2f2 ff2 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">prayer even before the Bible study group prayed. </div><div class="t m12f x4b hf y2f3 ff2 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Galina joined the &quot;cult&quot; she had avoided for so long. Later her </div><div class="t m2cf x71 hf y2f4 ff2 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">daughter also joined the church. They sponsor a small Bible study </div><div class="t m14 x71 hf y2f5 ff2 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">group in their home.
