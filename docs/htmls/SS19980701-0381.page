She sought comfort </div><div class="t m1e4 x18 hd y71c ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in God and attended several Three-Self churches in China. But she </div><div class="t m5a1 x18 hd y71d ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">found the teachings shallow. Then Li, a friend of her mother, invited </div><div class="t m31 x42 hd y71e ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Chen to a Bible study group in her church. When Chen hesitated, Li </div><div class="t m5bc x42 hd y71f ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">challenged her to answer the questions on a Bible lesson. When Chen </div><div class="t m3b4 x42 hd y720 ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">could not answer the questions, she agreed to go. She soon discov-</div><div class="t m353 x18 hd y721 ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ered that there was much she did not know about God. </div><div class="t m5bd x4a hd y722 ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Some of the questions on the Bible lessons puzzled Chen. &quot;If God </div><div class="t m5be x18 hd y723 ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">commanded that His followers worship Him on a special day, why do </div><div class="t m20f x18 hd y724 ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">most Christians not worship on that day?&quot; As Li and Chen studied </div><div class="t m32e x18 hd y725 ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">together, Chen found answers to these questions and many others. </div><div class="t m5a1 x18 hd y726 ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">She also found a closer walk with God. </div><div class="t m291 x4a hd y727 ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Chen began attending Sabbath services at Li&apos;s church. Because </div><div class="t m5bf x18 hd y703 ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">she was blind, her husband, Hua, took her to the meetings and waited </div><div class="t m1ad x18 hd y728 ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">outside for her. But Chen shared what she was learning with Hua, and </div><div class="t m401 x18 hd y729 ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in time he began to join her in studying the lessons and attending </div><div class="t m59f x18 hd y72a ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">worship services. </div><div class="t m25a x4b hd y72b ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Hua became convicted of his sinfulness and accepted Jesus as his </div><div class="t m5c0 x18 hd y72c ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Saviour too. Chen and Hua studied the Bible with Li and the pastor, </div><div class="t m5c1 x18 hd y72d ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and were baptized together just a few months ago. </div><div class="t m5c2 x4b hd y72e ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Now Chen feels truly happy and fulfilled. Her husband, Hua, feels </div><div class="t m5c3 x18 hd y72f ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">peace in his heart that he never knew was possible. This young couple </div><div class="t m102 x18 hd y730 ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">has pledged to make Jesus the Lord of their home. Chen no longer </div><div class="t m258 x18 hd y731 ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">cries over her blindness.
