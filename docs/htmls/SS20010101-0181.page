He was young and </div><div class="t m656 x96 hd y3e0 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">had no time for God. When his mother and sister became Adventists, </div><div class="t m657 x96 hd y3a ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">he often made fun of their new religion. </div><div class="t m658 x9c hd y4dd ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">One day the teenager awoke with pain in his joints. Within a few </div><div class="t m659 x96 hd y3e2 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">days, his entire body ached. The doctor told him that he had rheuma-</div><div class="t m5dd xc hd y3e3 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tism, a condition that causes the body&apos;s joints to become painfully </div><div class="t m65a x96 hd y5a1 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">inflamed. The doctor ordered hospital treatment and bed rest. </div><div class="t m65b x9c hd y3e5 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Jose was angry and frustrated. He wanted to work, to spend time </div><div class="t m4c1 x96 hd y3e6 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">with his friends, and to ride his motorcycle. Time hung heavy on his </div><div class="t m4be x96 hd y3e7 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">hands. With nothing to do all day, he reluctantly began reading some </div><div class="t m65c x96 hd y3e8 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">books that his sister offered him. Later she persuaded him to take Bible </div><div class="t m65d x96 hd y3e9 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">studies. But he was still not willing to accept Jesus as his Savior. </div><div class="t m65e x9c hd y4de ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">After a month in bed, Jose could not stand it any longer. He began </div><div class="t m11f x96 hd y3eb ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">going out with his friends for a drink or some fun. </div><div class="t m4b8 x9c hd y3ec ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">One Saturday Jose and his friends were invited to a wedding party. </div><div class="t m65f x96 hd y3ed ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">There would be plenty of alcohol, music, and girls. Jose did not want to </div><div class="t m111 x96 hd y3ee ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">miss it! Jose and a buddy eagerly mounted his motorcycle and sped </div><div class="t m660 x96 hd y3ef ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">toward the party. Jose slowed down for a speed bump in the road, but </div><div class="t m362 x96 hd y3f0 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the car behind him did not see the bump or slow down. Jose saw the </div><div class="t m661 x96 hd y4e2 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">car&apos;s headlights approaching and realized that it was going to hit them! </div><div class="t m367 x29 hd y4e ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Suddenly Jose flew through the air and hit the pavement. He lay </div><div class="t m5ea x96 hd y833 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">stunned for several seconds. Then he sat up and looked around. His </div><div class="t m43 x96 hd y3f3 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">motorcycle lay in a heap of twisted metal some 250 feet (80 meters) </div><div class="t m662 x96 hd y4e3 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">away. He looked for his friend but could not see him. </div><div class="t m5d x9c hd y3f5 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Eugenio!&quot; he called out, but he heard no answer. Then he saw his </div><div class="t m64 x60 hd y834 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">friend, lying under the car that had hit them. Jose stumbled over to his </div><div class="t m663 x60 hd y835 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">friend. Neither one of them had been wearing a helmet, and Jose could </div><div class="t m664 x96 hd y4e4 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">see that his friend had suffered serious head injuries. He was bleeding </div><div class="t m5ce x60 hd y836 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">heavily, but he was alive. </div><div class="t m560 x29 hd y4e5 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">A bus driver who had seen the accident offered to take the boys to </div><div class="t m39a x60 hd y837 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the hospital, and Jose accepted, for an ambulance might take too long, </div><div class="t m5ce x60 hd y4e7 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and his friend needed help right away. </div><div class="t m450 x29 hd y4e8 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The doctors examined Jose and released him, but his friend had </div><div class="t m35b x60 hd y4e9 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">suffered massive head injuries. He was in intensive care, and the </div><div class="t m5c8 x60 hd y838 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">outlook was not good. </div><div class="t ma4 x43 hd y839 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">(continued next week) </div><div class="t m11a x29 h15 y83a ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Jose das Neves Louro Filho is studying theology at Northeast </div><div class="t m665 x60 h15 y4eb ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Brazil College, where Merlinton Pastor de Oliveira is a pastor. </div><div class="t m660 x87 h34 y83b ff1 fs1b fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Produced by the Office of </div><div class="t m666 x32 h3c y83b ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Mission </div><div class="t m667 x64 h34 y83c ff1 fs1b fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Sabbath School-Personal Ministries Department of the General Conference </div><div class="t m668 x13 h34 y83d ff1 fs1b fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">E-mail: gomission@gc.adventist.org </div><div class="t m21 x88 h34 y83e ff1 fs1b fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0"></div><div class="t m669 x63 hd y32f ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">79 </div></div><div class="pi" data-data='{"ctm":[1.000000,0.000000,0.000000,1.000000,0.000000,0.000000]}'></div></div>
