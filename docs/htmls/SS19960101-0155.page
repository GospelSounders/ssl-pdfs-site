Even </div><div class="t m119 x2c h12 y7ac ff4 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">some of the man&apos;s cousins were baptized.

Satpal listened </div><div class="t m250 x2c h12 y7b7 ff4 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">carefully, and eventually accepted Jesus as his personal Savior. </div><div class="t m4f6 x3f h12 y418 ff4 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Satpal&apos;s family members began harassing him; some stopped </div><div class="t m53c x2c h12 y7b8 ff4 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">speaking to him.

But Satpal had found a faith stronger than his father&apos;s </div><div class="t m4c6 xa h12 y7ba ff4 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">witchcraft; he did not yield to Satan. Satpal married and moved </div><div class="t m266 xa h12 y7bb ff4 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">into a small one-room home.

Many thought that Satpal and his family would be </div><div class="t m541 xa h12 y7c2 ff4 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">harmed or killed, but to everyone&apos;s amazement, the family did not </div><div class="t m3e8 xa h12 y7c3 ff4 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">seek revenge. In fact, Satpal&apos;s mother began to open to the love of </div><div class="t m542 xa h12 y7c4 ff4 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">God.
