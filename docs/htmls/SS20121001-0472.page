His parents couldn’t stay with him </div><div class="t m0 x6e h5 y226 ff14 fs4 fc3 sc0 ls2 ws4a">while he recovered in the hospital, so his nurse stopped by often to chat. </div><div class="t m0 x6e h5 y227 ff14 fs4 fc3 sc0 ls2 ws65">Veresa looked forward to her visits and enjoyed hearing her talk about </div><div class="t m0 x6e h5 y228 ff14 fs4 fc3 sc0 ls2 ws6">Jesus and read him promises from the Bible. </div><div class="t m0 x42 h5 y229 ff14 fs4 fc3 sc0 ls2 ws6">Veresa had grown up attending church every Sunday, but he had never </div><div class="t m0 x6e h5 y22a ff14 fs4 fc3 sc0 ls2 ws2a">heard some of the things that his nurse talked about.

Veresa met the pastor and asked him questions </div><div class="t m0 x6e h5 y22f ff14 fs4 fc3 sc0 lsf ws6">about the Sabbath and other things that his faithful nurse had taught him. </div><div class="t m0 x42 h5 y230 ff14 fs4 fc3 sc0 ls2 ws126">One day Veresa told his parents that he had been attending the Seventh-</div><div class="t m0 x6e h5 y231 ff14 fs4 fc3 sc0 ls2 wsfd">day Adventist church.
