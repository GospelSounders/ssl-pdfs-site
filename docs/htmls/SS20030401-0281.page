H. Zachary </div><div class="t m62c x2c h31 y6cb ff2 fs1e fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">When Pravadras learned that the God of heaven sent Jesus to die for </div><div class="t m62d x52 h31 y6cc ff2 fs1e fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the sins of the world, he and his wife decided to become Christians. </div><div class="t m464 x3d h31 yd7 ff2 fs1e fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">After a year of Bible study, his pastor urged him to share his faith with </div><div class="t m162 x52 h31 y6cd ff2 fs1e fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">others. Pravadras helped his pastor on weekends and evenings and </div><div class="t m4d x52 h31 y6ce ff2 fs1e fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">eventually studied theology and became a Protestant minister. </div><div class="t me6 x2c h31 y6cf ff2 fs1e fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">After graduation, he moved to a large village and began door-to-</div><div class="t m16a x52 h31 y6d0 ff2 fs1e fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">door evangelism, looking for Hindus who would come to Jesus. As </div><div class="t m2fb x3d h31 y44 ff2 fs1e fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">interest grew, he raised funds and constructed a church. </div><div class="t m152 x2c h31 y6d1 ff2 fs1e fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Among Pravadras&apos;s members was a woman who had been praying </div><div class="t m8a x3d h31 y6d2 ff2 fs1e fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">for help for her church family. One day she dreamed that a helicopter </div><div class="t m169 x3d h31 y6d3 ff2 fs1e fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">landed in the center of her village. A man stepped out and told her, &quot;All </div><div class="t m4eb x3d h31 y6d4 ff2 fs1e fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the villagers have dirty spots in their lives. God will remove the spots </div><div class="t m152 x3d h31 y6d5 ff2 fs1e fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and make you clean if you follow His teachings.&quot; </div><div class="t m4eb x19 h31 y6d6 ff2 fs1e fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">When she told Pastor Pravadras about the dream, he replied, &quot;Yes, </div><div class="t ma8 x3d h31 y6d7 ff2 fs1e fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">God has more light for us, which we will follow.&quot; </div><div class="t m328 x2c h31 y6d8 ff2 fs1e fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">A few days later, Pastor Pravadras went to another city to attend a </div><div class="t m4d0 x3d h31 y6d9 ff2 fs1e fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">wedding. While there, he heard about a Christian meeting being </div><div class="t m194 x3d h31 y6da ff2 fs1e fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">conducted by a pastor from America. He decided that he would go to </div><div class="t m133 x3d h31 yb2 ff2 fs1e fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">one meeting before returning home. However, the meetings were so </div><div class="t m62c x3d h31 y6db ff2 fs1e fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">interesting that he decided to attend the entire series. He was amazed at </div><div class="t m39d x3d h31 y6dc ff2 fs1e fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the Bible knowledge of the pastor and noted that every point was </div><div class="t m41a x3d h31 y6dd ff2 fs1e fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">clearly based on Scripture. </div><div class="t me4 x19 h31 y6de ff2 fs1e fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Pravadras realized that for 36 years he had not been keeping the </div><div class="t m167 x3d h31 y6df ff2 fs1e fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Bible Sabbath. Late into the night he reviewed the Bible verses the </div><div class="t m92 x18 h31 y6e0 ff2 fs1e fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">pastor had presented. How could he have been teaching error for so </div><div class="t m62e x18 h31 y6e1 ff2 fs1e fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">long and leading others in error too? He asked God to forgive him and </div><div class="t m5d3 x3d h31 y6e2 ff2 fs1e fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">decided to follow this new truth God had revealed from the Bible. </div><div class="t m10b x19 h31 ybb ff2 fs1e fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">At the close of the meetings Pravadras returned home to share the </div><div class="t m2c5 x18 h31 ybc ff2 fs1e fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">news with his wife and church members. Soon he and his wife were </div><div class="t m170 x18 h31 y277 ff2 fs1e fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">rebaptized. As he presented the new truths to his congregation, they </div><div class="t m5c0 x3d h31 y8d ff2 fs1e fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">joined him in commitment to God&apos;s new light and also joined the </div><div class="t me0 x18 h31 y6e3 ff2 fs1e fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Adventist Church. Since Pravadras built his own church, it did not </div><div class="t m2cf x18 h31 y6e4 ff2 fs1e fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">belong to any denomination. The church became the Adventist church. </div><div class="t m2ab x19 h31 y6e5 ff2 fs1e fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;My wife and I have dedicated the rest of our lives to sharing the </div><div class="t m278 x18 h31 y6e6 ff2 fs1e fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">new Bible truths we have learned,&quot; Pastor Pavadras testified.
