Our identity is intricately tied in, if </div><div class="t m9e x46 h11 y88 ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">not inseparably linked to, our message. What we believe, and what we </div><div class="t m9f x49 h11 y89 ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">do with that belief make us who we are and justify our existence. </div><div class="t ma0 x49 h11 y8a ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Without our message, without our distinctive teachings, we could wake </div><div class="t ma1 x49 h11 y8b ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">up one day and suddenly discover we&apos;re of no more importance or </div><div class="t ma2 x49 h11 y8c ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">significance than a beetle. </div><div class="t ma3 x48 h11 y8d ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">This quarter&apos;s guide, </div><div class="t ma4 x29 h11 y8d ff7 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Pillars of Our Faith, </div><div class="t ma5 x4a h11 y8d ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">looks at our core </div><div class="t ma6 x49 h11 y8e ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">doctrines, the teachings that make us Seventh-day Adventists, the </div><div class="t ma7 x49 h11 y8f ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">truths that give us our distinct identity.
