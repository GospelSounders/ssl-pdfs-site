He read the sermon and said the </div><div class="t m0 x42 h1a y2f6 ff67 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws2f">sermon wasn’t biblical. Then he read several Bible texts that explained </div><div class="t m0 x42 h1a y2f7 ff67 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws1">what the Bible actually said. </div><div class="t m0 x7 h1a y2f8 ff67 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws58">I skipped church that Sunday.

I told the Seventh-day Adventist man, and he read me </div><div class="t m0 x42 h1a y2fa ff67 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws2e">two powerful Bible texts. “For what will it profit a man if he gains the </div><div class="t m0 x42 h1a y2fb ff67 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws81">whole world, and loses his own soul?” <span class="ff64">(Mark 8:36, NKJV), </span>and “Seek first </div><div class="t m0 x42 h1a y2fc ff67 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws16">the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things shall be </div><div class="t m0 x42 h1a y2fd ff67 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 wsef">added to you”<span class="ff64"> (Matt. 6:33, NKJV).</span> He invited me to visit his church. On </div><div class="t m0 x42 h1a y2fe ff67 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws77">Sabbath I found a few Seventh-day Adventists worshiping under a tree. </div><div class="t m0 x42 h1a y2ff ff67 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws1">But I sensed that God was there. </div><div class="t m0 x7 h1a y300 ff67 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws7b">The priest stopped paying my school fees, and I had to quit school.
