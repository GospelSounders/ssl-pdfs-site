Silent tears traced patterns on his sallow cheeks. &quot;Oh </div><div class="t m49e x3e h24 y822 ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Ama, I hurt so badly!

Her son had been sick for years.

One day Prakash </div><div class="t mc3 x3e h24 y82e ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">learned that some Christians lived in a nearby village.
