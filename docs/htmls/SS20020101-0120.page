With great fervor, the </div><div class="t m290 x55 h10 y2c1 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">accuser argued before God, &quot;This man cannot enter the kingdom. He </div><div class="t m291 x55 h10 y2c2 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">has violated the law times without number. He deserves death.

Finally, Luther said, &quot;In the name of Jesus Christ, </div><div class="t m294 x55 h10 yc6 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">move your hand!&quot; Satan then moved it from the scroll, which said: </div><div class="t m295 x55 h10 yc7 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;The blood of Jesus Christ cleanses Martin Luther from all his sins.&quot; </div><div class="t m296 x4d h10 yc8 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Here is the mystery of the Cross, the mystery of how God could be </div><div class="t m297 x55 h10 yc9 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">both just and merciful. At the Cross, He poured out His righteous and </div><div class="t m298 x55 h10 y2c5 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">just indignation against sin. That&apos;s God&apos;s justice. But He poured it out </div><div class="t m22a x55 h10 ycb ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in the person of Jesus, not us, the ones who deserved that punishment. </div><div class="t m299 x55 h10 y2c6 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">That&apos;s God&apos;s mercy.
