Many people have speculated on what </div><div class="t m9b x2c he y45 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">constitutes truth. Even with Truth standing before him, Pilate asked, </div><div class="t m330 x2c he y376 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;What is truth?&quot; (John 18:38). There are many and varied answers, </div><div class="t m331 x2c he y377 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and Satan delights in all of them, because they are all weapons in his </div><div class="t m5c x2c he y378 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">arsenal. But the Creator has the ultimate weapon. Jesus says that He </div><div class="t m22b x7a he y379 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">is the truth (John 14:6). Truth has put on human garb, and to know </div><div class="t m332 x7a he y37a ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Him is to know the Father and to have eternal life (John 14:9; 17:3). </div><div class="t m1f8 x48 hd y26d ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">So often, we tend to think of truth as propositions, statements, </div><div class="t m69 x7a hd y168 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">such as </div><div class="t m32f x85 hd y168 ff6 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">A=B and B=C, therefore A=C. </div><div class="t m8 x6e hd y168 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Jesus, however, by the state-</div><div class="t m122 x7a hd y37b ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ment that He </div><div class="t m333 x77 hd y37b ff6 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">is truth, </div><div class="t m334 x45 hd y37b ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">puts even the concept of truth in a whole </div><div class="t m335 x7a hd y16c ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">different perspective. How do we understand this idea of truth </div><div class="t m336 x7a hd y37c ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">being a Person? Consider the fact that Jesus is the Creator of </div><div class="t mcd x7a hd y16e ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">everything created (Col. 1:16).
