Whenever they had a chance, Velaphi and Dezzy sat </div><div class="t m85 x5 h21 y89c ff3 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">under a thorn tree while Velaphi taught her the songs he had learned </div><div class="t m53 x5 h21 ya72 ff3 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in school and told her stories of God. She was eager to learn. </div><div class="t m1f1 x72 h21 y670 ff3 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Soon vacation ended, and Velaphi returned to Solusi. For several </div><div class="t mbc x5 h21 y499 ff3 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">years the familiar rhythms of school filled his days.

But Dezzy was always eager to listen. And when Velaphi </div><div class="t m85 x5 h21 y8a2 ff3 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was 12 years old, he helped Dezzy give her life to Jesus. </div><div class="t m40 x72 h21 y8a3 ff3 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The children&apos;s parents were angry that Velaphi had taught Dezzy </div><div class="t m16b x5 h21 y8a4 ff3 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">about God.
