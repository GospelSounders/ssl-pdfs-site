Thessalonica at the time </div><div class="t mc9 xa h8 ybb ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of Paul&apos;s ministry was one of several capitals in the Roman province of Macedonia. </div><div class="t mca xa h8 ybc ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">This bustling seaport in Paul&apos;s day rivaled Corinth and Ephesus as a thoroughfare </div><div class="t mcb xa h8 ybd ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of commerce and trade. A major attraction in the first century A.D. was the </div><div class="t mcc xa h8 ybe ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">celebrated amphitheater where gladiators fought to the death for the amusement of </div><div class="t mcd xa h8 ybf ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">citizens and their guests. </div><div class="t mce xc h8 yc0 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Paul first visited Thessalonica during his second missionary journey, which is </div><div class="t mcf xa h8 yc1 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">thought to have occupied the years from A.D. 49 to 52. While visiting Asia Minor </div><div class="t ma2 xa h8 yc2 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">he received the divine call to minister in Macedonia (Acts 16:6-10). At Philippi he </div><div class="t m99 x4 h8 yc3 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was bitterly opposed and, in fact, jailed. When released he departed to Thessalonica </div><div class="t md0 xa h8 yc4 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">(Acts 17:1). </div><div class="t md1 xc h8 yc5 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Today the city is named Saloniki.

There is also </div><div class="t md4 x4 h8 yc8 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">a congregation of faithful Seventh-day Adventists. </div><div class="t md5 xc h8 yc9 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The letters of Paul to the church at Thessalonica, probably written between A.D. </div><div class="t md6 x4 h8 yca ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">50 and 52, give us in clear, concise language the apostle&apos;s concerns for the church, </div><div class="t md7 x4 h8 ycb ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">which he had only recently established.
