A major attraction in the first century A.D. was the </div><div class="t mcc xb ha ybf ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">celebrated amphitheater where gladiators fought to the death for the amusement of </div><div class="t mcd xb ha yc0 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">citizens and their guests. </div><div class="t mce xd ha yc1 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Paul first visited Thessalonica during his second missionary journey, which is </div><div class="t mcf xb ha yc2 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">thought to have occupied the years from A.D. 49 to 52. While visiting Asia Minor </div><div class="t ma2 xb ha yc3 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">he received the divine call to minister in Macedonia (Acts 16:6-10). At Philippi he </div><div class="t m99 x5 ha yc4 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was bitterly opposed and, in fact, jailed. When released he departed to Thessalonica </div><div class="t md0 xb ha yc5 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">(Acts 17:1). </div><div class="t md1 xd ha yc6 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Today the city is named Saloniki.
