First of all, as a career military officer, the centurion was </div><div class="t m627 x1e h15 y769 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">responsible for 100 Roman soldiers; and the Hebrews despised the </div><div class="t m5e9 x1e h15 y579 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Romans for their oppression over them. Second, the centurion sought </div><div class="t m24d x1e h15 y57a ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">help for his slave. Both Greeks and Romans considered slaves to be </div><div class="t m628 x1e h15 y57b ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">less than human (the Roman author Cato counseled people to throw </div><div class="t m16f x1e h15 y57c ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">out old, sick slaves along with useless agricultural implements). </div><div class="t m569 x1f h15 y76a ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Satan revels in such attitudes, for not only do they represent his </div><div class="t m629 x1e h15 y76b ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">character (as opposed to Christ&apos;s); they prevent the spread of the </div><div class="t m566 x1e h15 y76c ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">gospel.
