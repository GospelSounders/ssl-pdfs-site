It is not enough to </div><div class="t m620 x9c h16 y7ed ff3 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">be altered, changed, fixed up. The conversion that Jesus describes is </div><div class="t m3a0 x9c h16 y98b ff3 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">so completely different, so totally transforming, that only the image of </div><div class="t m109 x9c h16 y7ef ff3 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">being born again is sufficient. This term has been so overused (and </div><div class="t m139 x9c h16 y7f0 ff3 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">some would say abused) that it has lost much of its impact.
