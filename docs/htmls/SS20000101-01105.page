For six </div><div class="t m4a3 x51 hd y343 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">days young Sofyan remained a prisoner in his father&apos;s house. </div><div class="t m751 x50 hd y344 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Sofyan is a Muslim teenager living on the island of Java in Indone-</div><div class="t mcb x51 hd y345 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sia. When a friend invited him to attend a Christian church service, </div><div class="t mad x21 hd y346 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Sofyan refused. But his friend was persistent, and finally Sofyan </div><div class="t m752 x51 hd y347 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">agreed to attend, partly to please his friend and partly out of curiosity. </div><div class="t m55e x50 hd y348 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">As he neared the church building, he glanced nervously in all </div><div class="t m229 x51 hd y349 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">directions. No one must see him enter. The pastor read John 3:16. </div><div class="t mcf x21 hd y34a ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Sofyan had never heard such a wonderful message. </div><div class="t m2c1 x88 hd y34a ff3 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Allah loves me! </div><div class="t m4be x21 hd y34b ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">He turned this thought over and over in his mind as he contemplated </div><div class="t m25c x51 hd y34c ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the greatness of God&apos;s love. His heart was touched; he had to know </div><div class="t m459 x21 hd ya6e ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">more. </div><div class="t m753 x50 hd y34e ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Sofyan secretly returned to the church each week until his father </div><div class="t m581 x21 hd y34f ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">found out and locked him in his room for six days. Then his father </div><div class="t m71d x21 hd y350 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">released him after he promised to never enter a Christian church again. </div><div class="t m2b2 x21 hd y351 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">To keep Sofyan away from his Christian friends, he was sent to a far </div><div class="t m754 x21 hd y55 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">corner of the island. </div><div class="t m2a4 x22 hd y352 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Sofyan had studied the Qu&apos;ran, the Muslim holy book, for many </div><div class="t m2a3 x21 hd y353 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">years. He had won a prize for reciting from the Qu&apos;ran. Now far from </div><div class="t m755 x21 hd y17c ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">home, he read the Qu&apos;ran for comfort. One day he was amazed to read </div><div class="t m54d x21 hd y17d ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in the Qu&apos;ran that the seventh day is the holy day of Allah. Excited, </div><div class="t m1f1 x21 hd y17e ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Sofyan knocking on doors, asking people if they knew of any Chris-</div><div class="t m587 x21 hd y17f ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tians who kept the seventh day holy. Finally he found someone. </div><div class="t m126 x22 hd y180 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Yes,&quot; the man said. &quot;I keep holy the Sabbath day of God. There is </div><div class="t m35a x21 hd y181 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">a congregation of Sabbath keepers here in the city.&quot; </div><div class="t mc5 x22 hd y355 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Sofyan asked the man about other beliefs.

He recognized God&apos;s </div><div class="t m6de xac hd y186 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">truth and asked for baptism. Sofyan rejoiced in his new walk with God. </div><div class="t m57e x22 hd y30c ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Then Sofyan&apos;s uncle died.

But neighbors </div><div class="t m756 x59 hd y18a ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ho heard the scuffle intervened.
