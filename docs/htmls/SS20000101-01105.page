For six </div><div class="t m4a3 x50 hb y342 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">days young Sofyan remained a prisoner in his father&apos;s house. </div><div class="t m751 x4f hb y343 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Sofyan is a Muslim teenager living on the island of Java in Indone-</div><div class="t mcb x50 hb y344 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sia. When a friend invited him to attend a Christian church service, </div><div class="t mad x20 hb y345 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Sofyan refused. But his friend was persistent, and finally Sofyan </div><div class="t m752 x50 hb y346 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">agreed to attend, partly to please his friend and partly out of curiosity. </div><div class="t m55e x4f hb y347 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">As he neared the church building, he glanced nervously in all </div><div class="t m229 x50 hb y348 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">directions. No one must see him enter. The pastor read John 3:16. </div><div class="t mcf x20 hb y349 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Sofyan had never heard such a wonderful message. </div><div class="t m2c1 x87 hb y349 ff3 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Allah loves me! </div><div class="t m4be x20 hb y34a ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">He turned this thought over and over in his mind as he contemplated </div><div class="t m25c x50 hb y34b ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the greatness of God&apos;s love.

Then his father </div><div class="t m71d x20 hb y34f ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">released him after he promised to never enter a Christian church again. </div><div class="t m2b2 x20 hb y350 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">To keep Sofyan away from his Christian friends, he was sent to a far </div><div class="t m754 x20 hb y54 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">corner of the island. </div><div class="t m2a4 x21 hb y351 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Sofyan had studied the Qu&apos;ran, the Muslim holy book, for many </div><div class="t m2a3 x20 hb y352 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">years.
