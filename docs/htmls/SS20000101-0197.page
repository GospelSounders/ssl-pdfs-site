Although she </div><div class="t m689 x2 h2c ya21 ff6 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">had become a Christian, she had never let go of her anger and </div><div class="t m710 x2 h2c ya22 ff6 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">bitterness toward those who wronged her. Her relationship with God </div><div class="t m647 x2 h2c ya23 ff6 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and with others was rooted in legalism rather than love. </div><div class="t m711 x73 h2c y931 ff6 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">In letters to her I encouraged her to look to Jesus for the power to </div><div class="t m6de x9 h2c ya24 ff6 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">forgive others and love them. And I asked my prayer partners to pray </div><div class="t m712 x9 h2c y933 ff6 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">for her. </div><div class="t m713 x73 h2c ya25 ff6 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Six months later I received a letter from Ruthie. She was a different </div><div class="t m4bc x9 h2c y935 ff6 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">woman. Instead of bitterness and hatred, her letter was filled with </div><div class="t m714 x2 h2c ya26 ff6 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">praise to God. She was living in the same bleak cell, surrounded by the </div><div class="t m715 x9 h2c ya27 ff6 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">same angry people, yet she had found love and forgiveness in her </div><div class="t m716 x9 h2c ya28 ff6 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Friend Jesus. </div><div class="t m717 x73 h2c ya29 ff6 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;I wish I could get out of [prison],&quot; she said, &quot;so I could become a </div><div class="t m4a3 x9 h2c y4f ff6 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">missionary!&quot; </div><div class="t m515 x73 h2c ya2a ff6 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Rejoicing over the change in Ruthie&apos;s life, I wrote back to her. &quot;Do </div><div class="t m6c5 x9 h2c y93b ff6 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">you realize that you are in a . . . larger mission field than many of our </div><div class="t m718 x9 h2c ya2b ff6 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">missionaries?&quot; I shared with her my philosophy that most of us are </div><div class="t m53b x9 h2c ya2c ff6 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">already in the mission field where God wants us to work. </div><div class="t m719 x20 h2c y93e ff6 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Ruthie&apos;s letters sparkle with hope and joy in Jesus.

But Ruthie&apos;s greatest joy came the day her </div><div class="t m71c x9 h2c y942 ff6 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">mother accepted Jesus as her Savior and was baptized. </div><div class="t m612 x20 h2c ya2f ff6 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The prison&apos;s policy makes it difficult to place religious books in </div><div class="t m1f1 x9 h2c ya30 ff6 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the prison library.
