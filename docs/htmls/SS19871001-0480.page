Thus it came down to a matter of </div><div class="t m460 x2a h17 y4f3 ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">running a calculated risk by approaching the king or of facing almost certain </div><div class="t m4b4 x5 h17 y9c9 ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">destruction later. Secondly, Mordecai&apos;s knowledge of history, his faith in </div><div class="t m2b2 x5 h17 y9ca ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">God, and his certainty of the favored status of the Jews made it impossible </div><div class="t m29a x5 h17 y9cb ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">for him to believe that God would allow them to be annihilated. He assured </div><div class="t m252 x5 h17 y9cc ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Esther that deliverance would come in some form or other. Finally, Morde-</div><div class="t m16e x5 h17 y9cd ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">cai argued on the basis of how truly phenomenal it was that a Jewess should </div><div class="t m2ae x5 h17 y9ce ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">be queen at a time when Jewish needs were so great. </div><div class="t m184 x5 hd y9cf ff1 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">THINK IT THROUGH: Mordecai&apos;s statement to Esther that &quot;if you </div><div class="t m19e x5 hd y9d0 ff1 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">remain silent at this time, relief and deliverance for the Jews will arise </div><div class="t m125 x5 hd y9d1 ff1 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">from another place&quot; (Esther 4:14, NIV) reveals his belief that a higher </div><div class="t m2cd x5 hd y2e2 ff1 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">power is in charge of history and that history can be overruled. But why </div><div class="t m136 x5 hd y9d2 ff1 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">does he not state it more clearly? Why does the book seem to go out of its </div><div class="t m386 x5 hd y9d3 ff1 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">way to avoid mentioning God and religion? </div><div class="t m5b3 xb7 h17 y9d4 ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">One thing that has puzzled and disturbed readers of Esther has been the </div><div class="t mc7 x5 h17 y9d5 ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">book&apos;s pattern of ignoring God and the features of Old Testament religion. </div><div class="t m153 x5 h17 y13 ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The author mentions the king of Persia 130 times, but the King of the uni-</div><div class="t m302 x5 h17 y9d6 ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">verse not even once. Nor does he allude to the usual themes of law or cov-</div><div class="t m1cf x2b h17 y9d7 ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">enant. The book does not speak of angels or the afterlife. Nothing is said of </div><div class="t m235 x2b h17 y9d8 ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">such things as love, kindness, mercy, and forgiveness—concepts prominent </div><div class="t m2ed x5 h17 y9d9 ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in the rest of the Old Testament. Perhaps most strange of all, this story of </div><div class="t m14c x2b h17 y9da ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">God&apos;s people in a time of danger does not even talk about prayer. The only </div><div class="t m3e9 x2b h17 y9db ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">religious practice it does portray is that of fasting. </div><div class="t m2e9 x3a h17 y9dc ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Esther is not the only book in the Bible that does this. The Song of Solo-</div><div class="t m60f x5 h17 y9dd ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">mon does not mention the name of God either, with the possible exception of </div><div class="t m244 x2b h17 y9de ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">8:6 where the phrase &quot;vehement flame&quot; (RSV) or &quot;mighty flame&quot; (NIV) </div><div class="t m159 x2b h17 y9df ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">could be translated &quot;a flame of Yah (Yahweh)&quot; or &quot;like the very flame of the </div><div class="t m132 x2b h17 y9e0 ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Lord&quot; (NW footnote). From such examples, we see that God is willing to </div><div class="t m85 x2b h17 yd5 ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">allow His spokesmen at times to present His presence by implication, as </div><div class="t m2dc x2b h17 y9e1 ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">well as more directly. </div><div class="t m63 x3a h17 y9e2 ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The authors of Esther and the Song of Solomon had their reasons for </div><div class="t m1e9 x2b h17 y9e3 ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">presenting their inspired material as they did. We must not judge Scripture </div><div class="t m3e4 x2b h17 y9e4 ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">by our own ideas of how God&apos;s penmen should have written. </div><div class="t m16e x2b hd y9e5 ff1 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ILLUMINATION: </div><div class="t m116 x3b h17 y9e6 ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;The Lord gave His word in just the way He wanted it </div><div class="t m1f2 x2b h17 y9e7 ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to come.
