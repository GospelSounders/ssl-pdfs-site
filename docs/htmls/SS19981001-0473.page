With time on his hands, he began looking for </div><div class="t m3ce x61 he y4a4 ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">new friends and interesting things to do. He became involved with </div><div class="t m5d2 x61 he y423 ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">some young people who worshiped Satan. They taught him how to </div><div class="t m1c4 x61 he y15f ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">call up demons, and he soon won their respect, for he seemed to </div><div class="t m142 x16 he y424 ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">have great psychic power. </div><div class="t m228 x3f he y161 ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The young people spent their time smoking marijuana, drink-</div><div class="t m4c2 x16 he y425 ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ing, and listening to hard rock music. Josef bought a motorcycle so </div><div class="t m1c4 x16 he y163 ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">he could ride with his friends. But a serious accident nearly cost </div><div class="t m2f x16 he y1ae ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">him his life when a piece of flying debris cut a long gash in his </div><div class="t m90 x16 he y165 ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">neck, and he nearly bled to death. The doctor who cared for him </div><div class="t m231 x16 he y166 ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">told him he was lucky to be alive. &quot;You should have died beside </div><div class="t m158 x16 he y167 ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the road,&quot; he told Josef solemnly. But Josef paid little attention. </div><div class="t m28a x16 he y169 ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">He did not believe in God. </div><div class="t m238 x2f he y1b0 ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Just weeks after his near-fatal accident, Josef was again riding </div><div class="t m5d3 x16 he y427 ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">his motorcycle. Then one day as he sped down a road, he lost </div><div class="t m4e1 x16 he y16b ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">control and hit a pole, tearing his motorcycle apart and throwing </div><div class="t m1a6 x16 he y1b3 ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">him into a ditch. But he climbed out of the ditch with barely a </div><div class="t m37e x16 he y1b4 ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">scratch. His friends began calling him Lucky, but Josef began to </div><div class="t m4e3 x16 he y16c ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">think that maybe something—or Someone—had saved his life. </div><div class="t me9 x16 he y508 ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">But why? Was God trying to tell him something? </div><div class="t m1c3 x2f he y16e ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Josef knew nothing about religion; he felt he needed to learn if </div><div class="t m18c x16 he y12d ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">God exists and what God wanted from him. He had no idea which </div><div class="t m3c2 x16 he y170 ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">church to attend, so he looked up a friend who was a Christian. </div><div class="t m1b6 x16 he y12f ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Josef talked to him about religion and began attending church and </div><div class="t m94 x16 he y1b5 ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">studying the Bible with him. </div><div class="t m5d4 x2f he y131 ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The devil was not willing to let Josef go without a struggle.

He tried to get out of bed, but he could not move. </div><div class="t m1b6 x35 he y134 ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">It was as if a mighty hand was holding him down. The experience </div><div class="t m375 x35 he y135 ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">frightened him, and when he told his girlfriend, she became fright-</div><div class="t m94 x35 he y136 ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ened too. &quot;You must pray to God—and keep studying the Bible!&quot; </div><div class="t m15a x35 he y377 ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">she urged.
