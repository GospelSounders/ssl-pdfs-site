He heard voices inside and thought the fam<span class="ls2 ws4">-</span></div><div class="t m0 x64 h36 y377 ff10 fs3 fc3 sc0 ls12 ws6d">ily had guests. But before he could leave, the door swung open and a woman </div><div class="t m0 x64 h36 y378 ff10 fs3 fc3 sc0 ls12 ws5">invited him in. </div><div class="t m0 x14 h36 y379 ff10 fs3 fc3 sc0 ls12 ws9c">She removed some papers from a chair and invited Anatoly to sit down. She </div><div class="t m0 x64 h36 y37a ff10 fs3 fc3 sc0 ls12 ws35">offered him some tea and introduced him to her 12 children. Anatoly shook </div><div class="t m0 x64 h36 y37b ff10 fs3 fc3 sc0 ls12 ws9d">off his surprise and offered the family a book and a Bible enrollment card. The </div><div class="t m0 x64 h36 y37c ff10 fs3 fc3 sc0 ls12 ws84">woman seemed pleased to have the booklet. They visited for a few minutes </div><div class="t m0 x64 h36 y37d ff10 fs3 fc3 sc0 ls12 ws5">before Anatoly stood to leave. The woman invited him to come again. </div><div class="t m0 x14 h36 y37e ff10 fs3 fc3 sc0 ls12 wsda">As Anatoly walked home, he was glad he had gone to that last house. He </div><div class="t m0 x64 h36 y37f ff10 fs3 fc3 sc0 ls12 ws5">decided to visit the family again.</div><div class="t m0 x14 h36 y380 ff10 fs3 fc3 sc0 ls12 ws7f">When Anatoly returned to see the family, they seemed cautious.

But the parents gently refused his invitation. So when </div><div class="t m0 x64 h36 y383 ff10 fs3 fc3 sc0 ls12 ws95">Anatoly saw Natasha, her brother, Vania, and sister, Lena, at the meetings, </div><div class="t m0 x64 h36 y384 ff10 fs3 fc3 sc0 ls12 ws5">he was surprised. “Did your parents change their mind and let you come?” </div><div class="t m0 x14 h36 y385 ff10 fs3 fc3 sc0 ls12 wsaf">“Not exactly,” Natasha said. “We told Mother that we were going for a </div><div class="t m0 x64 h36 y386 ff10 fs3 fc3 sc0 ls12 ws117">walk.

I want to come back, but I don’t </div><div class="t m0 x64 h36 y387 ff10 fs3 fc3 sc0 ls12 ws21">know whether my parents will allow us.” Anatoly promised to pray that they </div><div class="t m0 x64 h36 y388 ff10 fs3 fc3 sc0 ls12 ws5">could attend the meetings. </div><div class="t m0 x14 h36 y389 ff10 fs3 fc3 sc0 ls12 ws55">Natasha, Vania, and Lena attended the meetings, but their parents refused </div><div class="t m0 x64 h36 y38a ff10 fs3 fc3 sc0 ls12 ws34">to allow them to attend church on Sabbath. Yet, the three had learned about </div><div class="t m0 x64 h36 y38b ff10 fs3 fc3 sc0 ls12 ws5a">the importance of the Sabbath and were determined to keep God’s holy day. </div><div class="t m0 x64 h36 y38c ff10 fs3 fc3 sc0 ls12 ws1b">Natasha told her parents simply, “God is God.

What He commands, we must do.” </div><div class="t m0 x14 h36 y38e ff10 fs3 fc3 sc0 ls12 wsd4">The children worked hard to finish their chores by Friday so they could </div><div class="t m0 x64 h36 y38f ff10 fs3 fc3 sc0 ls12 ws23">worship on Sabbath. Natasha asked to be baptized, and Vania and Lena joined </div><div class="t m0 x64 h36 y390 ff10 fs3 fc3 sc0 ls12 wsb9">Pathfinders. The children were such good examples at home that their parents </div><div class="t m0 x64 h36 y391 ff10 fs3 fc3 sc0 ls12 ws55">agreed they could attend church.
