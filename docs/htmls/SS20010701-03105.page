As a child he and fellow </div><div class="t m5e4 x4f h11 y9ed ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">villagers fled as his mountain village was caught in the crossfire be-</div><div class="t m463 xf h11 y9ee ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tween government troops and communist rebels. When he was 14 he </div><div class="t m232 x4f h11 y41 ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">joined the rebel guerrillas. </div><div class="t m779 x49 h11 y9ef ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">He quickly mastered the skills to ambush and kill enemy soldiers, </div><div class="t m67d xf h11 y9f0 ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and soon Scar Face became a squad leader. He soon lost count of the </div><div class="t m4a6 x4f h11 y2f8 ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">number of enemy soldiers he had killed by gun, land mines, and jungle </div><div class="t m77a x4f h11 y9f1 ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">traps. Before long Scar Face was on the government&apos;s &quot;most wanted&quot; </div><div class="t m668 x4f h11 y9f2 ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">list. The orders were to shoot to kill. </div><div class="t m77b x49 h11 y9f3 ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Unable to wipe out the rebels, the government troops pulled back, </div><div class="t m557 x4f h11 y9f4 ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and the fighting stopped. Scar Face and his men cautiously returned to </div><div class="t m77c x4f h11 y9f5 ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tending their small farms, always on the alert for a surprise attack. </div><div class="t m521 x49 h11 y9f6 ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Scar Face married and started a family. Soon he realized that he </div><div class="t m77d x4f h11 y9f7 ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">needed to find a better way to provide for his family. He surrendered his </div><div class="t m44e x4f h11 y6eb ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">arms to his commander. The commander offered him a higher rank and </div><div class="t m762 x4f h11 y4cf ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">better pay, but Scar Face refused. Together with a few others, Scar Face </div><div class="t m77e x4f h11 y4d0 ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">marched down the mountain and surrendered to the authorities in town. </div><div class="t m62 x4f h11 y6ec ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The government granted them amnesty, though the townspeople still </div><div class="t m77f x4f h11 y6ed ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">wanted to see him dead for his murderous past. </div><div class="t m543 x46 h11 y47e ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Adventists learned that the children of Scar Face&apos;s village had no </div><div class="t m780 x4f h11 y6ef ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">school to attend. A team from Mountain View College went to the village </div><div class="t m781 x4f h11 y6f0 ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to learn if the villagers wanted a school. With promise of protection and a </div><div class="t m782 x4f h11 y6f1 ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">temporary school building, two student missionaries were appointed to </div><div class="t m72b x2d h11 y6f2 ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">teach in the village. On the first day of school the children crowded into </div><div class="t m761 x2d h11 y482 ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">their temporary classroom and sat on the floor. They wrote their lessons </div><div class="t m783 x4f h11 y630 ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">on pieces of rough boards. But they are learning. </div><div class="t m615 x46 h11 y631 ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Scar Face told the villagers, &quot;These teachers have been sent by the </div><div class="t m6cc x2d h11 y632 ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">great God to teach us a better way of life.
