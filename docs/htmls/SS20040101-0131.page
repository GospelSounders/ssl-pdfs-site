He joined other </div><div class="t md0 x55 h3 y3e5 ff1 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">students who spent a summer selling books in a Siberian city. </div><div class="t m2f3 x56 h3 y3ce ff1 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Alcohol and drugs are major health issues there, and one-third of the </div><div class="t m31b x55 h3 y3e6 ff1 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">residents are addicts. Again and again women cried, &quot;Help me. My son is </div><div class="t m211 x55 h3 y3d0 ff1 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">a drug addict; my husband is an alcoholic.&quot; </div><div class="t m3b0 x56 h3 y3d1 ff1 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Tars was tired and wanted to quit for the day. But a storm raged outside, </div><div class="t m3bf x55 h3 y3d2 ff1 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">so he knocked on the next door. A woman opened the door, and Tars intro-</div><div class="t m3c0 x55 h3 y3e7 ff1 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">duced himself and his purpose. The woman invited him into the kitchen. </div><div class="t m30c x55 h3 y2e3 ff1 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Tars learned that she was a nurse in a hospital detox unit. She believed in </div><div class="t m3c1 x55 h3 y2e4 ff1 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">God but did not attend church. </div><div class="t m55 x56 h3 y2e5 ff1 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The woman&apos;s husband came in, and Tars showed them several books on </div><div class="t m360 x55 h3 y2e6 ff1 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">health and the Bible. The set cost $15, three weeks&apos; pay, and Tars was sure </div><div class="t m3c2 x55 h3 y3e8 ff1 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">they could not afford it. But the couple said if he would bring the books in </div><div class="t m237 x55 h3 y2e7 ff1 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">three weeks, they would have the money. </div><div class="t m3c3 x56 h3 y204 ff1 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Three weeks later Tars returned with the books. When they finally </div><div class="t m167 x55 h3 y2e8 ff1 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">answered the door, it was apparent the couple had been drinking. His heart </div><div class="t m99 x55 h3 y2e9 ff1 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">fell, thinking that these people had spent on alcohol the money for the </div><div class="t m3c4 x55 h3 y2ea ff1 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">books. </div><div class="t m3c5 x56 h3 y3e9 ff1 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;I&apos;ve brought your books,&quot; he said as cheerfully as he could. The cou-</div><div class="t m267 x55 h3 y3ea ff1 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ple sat down at the table and scanned the books. Then the wife went to the </div><div class="t m3c6 x55 h3 y2ec ff1 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">cupboard and pulled out the money. &quot;We wish you would stay and tell us </div><div class="t m3c7 x47 h3 y2ed ff1 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">more about what you believe,&quot; they requested. Tars stayed, and the three </div><div class="t m3c1 x47 h3 y3eb ff1 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">talked for a long time. </div><div class="t m1b0 x85 h3 y3ec ff1 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Later Tars gave the couple&apos;s name to the local elder of the tiny church in </div><div class="t m174 x47 h3 y3ed ff1 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that city. The church had only eight members, and the pastor had 10 </div><div class="t m15f x89 h3 y3ee ff1 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">churches, all 35 to 200 miles (50 to 300 km) </div><div class="t m3c8 x45 h3 y3ef ff1 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">from one another.
