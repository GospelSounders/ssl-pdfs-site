The village is built over a lake. </div><div class="t m1c9 x1e h1b y486 ff4 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Each building is constructed to stand several feet above the water. </div><div class="t m111 x1e h1b y487 ff4 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">People travel from place to place by boat, transport their goods to </div><div class="t m3ac x1e h1b y488 ff4 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">market by boat, and even hold their marketplace in boats on the </div><div class="t m3f x1e h1b y489 ff4 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">water. </div><div class="t m3ad x55 h1b y48a ff4 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">When Antoinette&apos;s fifth child was due, she went to the village </div><div class="t m3ae x1e h1b y48b ff4 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">maternity clinic to give birth.
