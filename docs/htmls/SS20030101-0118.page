The divine &quot;I&quot; who </div><div class="t m268 x2a hb y1cc ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">offers the covenant is Himself the ground of Noah&apos;s security. As the </div><div class="t m209 x2a hb y290 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">covenant-keeping God, the Lord promised to protect the family mem-</div><div class="t m7c x2a hb y291 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">bers who were willing to live in a committed relationship with Him, one </div><div class="t m200 x2a hb y292 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that resulted in obedience. </div><div class="t m50 x70 h11 y293 ff7 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Was the covenant with Noah just one-sided?

But God makes a deal with him, in which He promises to </div><div class="t m26e x2a hb y299 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">save Noah and his family. Thus, the stakes were quite high, because if </div><div class="t m26f x2a hb y29a ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">God did not uphold His end of the promise, then no matter what Noah </div><div class="t m270 x2a hb y29b ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">did, he would have been wiped out with the rest of the world. </div><div class="t m1be x70 hb y29c ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">God said He would make a &quot;covenant&quot; with Noah.
