He continues to offer the covenant </div><div class="t m1dc xa h9 y28e ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">relationship first set in operation after the Fall. The divine &quot;I&quot; who </div><div class="t m268 x29 h9 y1cb ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">offers the covenant is Himself the ground of Noah&apos;s security. As the </div><div class="t m209 x29 h9 y28f ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">covenant-keeping God, the Lord promised to protect the family mem-</div><div class="t m7c x29 h9 y290 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">bers who were willing to live in a committed relationship with Him, one </div><div class="t m200 x29 h9 y291 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that resulted in obedience. </div><div class="t m50 x6f hf y292 ff7 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Was the covenant with Noah just one-sided? Remember that the </div><div class="t m269 x29 hf y293 ff7 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">idea of a covenant implies more than one party. Did Noah have his end </div><div class="t m26a x29 hf y294 ff7 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of the deal to uphold?

But God makes a deal with him, in which He promises to </div><div class="t m26e x29 h9 y298 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">save Noah and his family. Thus, the stakes were quite high, because if </div><div class="t m26f x29 h9 y299 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">God did not uphold His end of the promise, then no matter what Noah </div><div class="t m270 x29 h9 y29a ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">did, he would have been wiped out with the rest of the world. </div><div class="t m1be x6f h9 y29b ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">God said He would make a &quot;covenant&quot; with Noah. The word itself </div><div class="t m271 x29 h9 y29c ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">implies an intention to honor what you say you will do.
