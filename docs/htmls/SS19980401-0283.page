The true </div><div class="t m50b x39 he y822 ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">cause of the happiness of those whom Jesus declared &quot;blessed&quot; is not </div><div class="t m1ac x39 he y823 ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">found in themselves. Rather it is in the Lord&apos;s promise to them. In each </div><div class="t m17a x39 he y824 ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">beatitude Jesus stated the reason for happiness in the second part of </div><div class="t m1e1 x39 he y825 ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the declaration. The poor in spirit, they that mourn, those who hunger </div><div class="t m581 x39 he y2de ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and thirst, the persecuted. All are blessed because Jesus is able to </div><div class="t m651 x16 he y826 ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">promise them the kingdom of heaven, consolation, satisfaction, the title </div><div class="t me1 x39 he y2e0 ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;son of God,&quot; a vision of God. </div><div class="t m53 x3b he y827 ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Clearly, persecution itself cannot be a cause for rejoicing for those </div><div class="t m652 x16 he y2e2 ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">who suffer.

The happiness </div><div class="t m1df x16 he y546 ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of the persecuted Christians has its source in Christ.

That is so &quot;because the </div><div class="t m2a5 x16 he y829 ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">spirit of glory and of God rests upon you,&quot; and because you suffer &quot;as </div><div class="t m649 x16 he y54a ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">a Christian&quot; (1 Peter 4:14, 16, RSV). </div><div class="t m24f x3b h30 y54c ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">What are two reasons for rejoicing, according to Jesus?
