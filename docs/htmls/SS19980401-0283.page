The true </div><div class="t m50b x38 hc y821 ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">cause of the happiness of those whom Jesus declared &quot;blessed&quot; is not </div><div class="t m1ac x38 hc y822 ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">found in themselves. Rather it is in the Lord&apos;s promise to them. In each </div><div class="t m17a x38 hc y823 ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">beatitude Jesus stated the reason for happiness in the second part of </div><div class="t m1e1 x38 hc y824 ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the declaration. The poor in spirit, they that mourn, those who hunger </div><div class="t m581 x38 hc y2dd ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and thirst, the persecuted.
