Jesus got into </div><div class="t m22e x3a h11 y139 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Peter&apos;s boat and preached to the crowd. When He finished speaking, </div><div class="t m3c4 x3a h11 y13a ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">he told Peter to let the nets into the water. Though Peter expressed </div><div class="t m3c5 x3a h11 y13b ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">skepticism about catching anything, he was apparently impressed </div><div class="t m6a x3a h11 y13c ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">enough by Jesus that he obeyed anyway. The rest is history. </div><div class="t m3c6 x73 hf y17c ff3 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Read verse 8. Peter says to Jesus, &quot;Depart from me,&quot; because I </div><div class="t m3c7 x3a hf y17d ff3 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">am sinful. Is it not precisely because we are sinful that we would </div><div class="t m3c8 x3a hf y338 ff3 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">want Jesus to be with us?

In other words, the first thing Jesus does is tell Simon </div><div class="t m8c x3a h11 y206 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Peter the work He is going to have Him do. Perhaps Jesus, knowing </div><div class="t m3ce x3a h11 y144 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Peter&apos;s lack of self-esteem, immediately told him of his important task </div><div class="t m3cf x3a h11 y207 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in order to help Peter understand that, although he was a sinner, Christ </div><div class="t m13 x3a h11 y208 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">not only accepted him but was going to trust him with important work. </div><div class="t m3d0 x73 h11 y147 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Thus, one result of being forgiven by God is that we should </div><div class="t m3d1 x3a h11 y1c9 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">learn to respect ourselves as His children and feel good about who </div><div class="t m2be x3a h11 y209 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">we are by His grace. Sure, Peter was a sinful man, and he knew his </div><div class="t m3d2 x3a h11 y14a ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sinfulness. Yet, imagine what it must have done for his sense of </div><div class="t m3d3 x3a h11 y2be ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">self-worth to be told by the Master that instead of now catching </div><div class="t m3d4 x3a h11 y20b ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">fish he would be working with Him to win souls.
