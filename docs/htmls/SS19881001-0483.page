WHY WILL HE COME? </div><div class="t m3a3 x45 h15 y946 ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The reason for Jesus&apos; second coming is that He loves His human brothers </div><div class="t m140 x8 h15 y947 ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and sisters and wants them to be with Him. &quot;I go to prepare a place for </div><div class="t m470 x8 h15 y39e ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">you,&quot; He told the first disciples. &quot;And if I go and prepare a place for you, I </div><div class="t m4e4 x8 h15 y833 ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">will come again, and receive you unto myself; that where I am, there ye may </div><div class="t m16a x8 h15 y200 ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">be also&quot; (John 14:2, 3). Jesus will take His beloved—including those who </div><div class="t m82 x8 h15 y3a1 ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">have died and are resurrected when He comes—to heaven with Him. (See </div><div class="t m149 x8 h15 y948 ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">1 Thess. 4:16, 17.) </div><div class="t m3a3 x45 h17 y257 ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">What all-inclusive reason for Christ&apos;s second coming is mentioned in </div><div class="t m9d x8 h17 y19d ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Hebrews 9:28? </div><div class="t m4ca x45 h15 y2ea ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Here is the one text in the Bible that links the term </div><div class="t m597 x57 h15 y2ea ff5 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">second </div><div class="t m384 x89 h15 y2ea ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">with Christ&apos;s </div><div class="t m36 x8 h15 y36c ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">return.

The </div><div class="t m13f x2d h15 y1d2 ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;blessed hope&quot; that Christ gives the believer is not only for this life but </div><div class="t mbd x2d h15 y94d ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">includes the life that the righteous receive </div><div class="t m5b3 xf h15 y94d ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">-</div><div class="t me4 xc3 h15 y94d ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">on the resurrection day. Second, </div><div class="t m23 x2d h15 y1d5 ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Paul holds out hope for those who die in Christ. He argues that if there is no </div><div class="t m275 x2d h15 y94e ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">second coming of Christ, then there can be no resurrection of the dead. In </div><div class="t m4fe x2d h15 y94f ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that case our belief, hope, and trust in Christ would be quite transitory and </div><div class="t m41 x2d h15 y2d1 ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">futile.
