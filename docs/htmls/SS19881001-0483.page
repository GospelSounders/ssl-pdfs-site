WHY WILL HE COME? </div><div class="t m3a3 x44 h12 y945 ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The reason for Jesus&apos; second coming is that He loves His human brothers </div><div class="t m140 x7 h12 y946 ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and sisters and wants them to be with Him. &quot;I go to prepare a place for </div><div class="t m470 x7 h12 y39d ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">you,&quot; He told the first disciples. &quot;And if I go and prepare a place for you, I </div><div class="t m4e4 x7 h12 y832 ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">will come again, and receive you unto myself; that where I am, there ye may </div><div class="t m16a x7 h12 y1ff ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">be also&quot; (John 14:2, 3). Jesus will take His beloved—including those who </div><div class="t m82 x7 h12 y3a0 ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">have died and are resurrected when He comes—to heaven with Him.

The </div><div class="t m13f x2c h12 y1d1 ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;blessed hope&quot; that Christ gives the believer is not only for this life but </div><div class="t mbd x2c h12 y94c ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">includes the life that the righteous receive </div><div class="t m5b3 xe h12 y94c ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">-</div><div class="t me4 xc3 h12 y94c ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">on the resurrection day. Second, </div><div class="t m23 x2c h12 y1d4 ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Paul holds out hope for those who die in Christ. He argues that if there is no </div><div class="t m275 x2c h12 y94d ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">second coming of Christ, then there can be no resurrection of the dead. In </div><div class="t m4fe x2c h12 y94e ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that case our belief, hope, and trust in Christ would be quite transitory and </div><div class="t m41 x2c h12 y2d0 ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">futile.
