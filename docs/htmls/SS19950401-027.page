Coming at </div><div class="t mbf x40 h1d yc8 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the end of the forty years&apos; wilderness wandering, it describes the </div><div class="t mc0 x40 h1d yc9 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">fulfillment of the promises God made to the patriarchs in Genesis that </div><div class="t mc1 x40 h1d yca ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Israel would enter and inherit the land of Canaan. On the other hand, </div><div class="t mc2 x40 h1d ycb ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the book of Joshua is the foundation for the rest of the biblical story. It </div><div class="t mc3 x40 h1d ycc ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">is the first book of the former prophets (in the Hebrew Bible) or the </div><div class="t mc4 x40 h1d ycd ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">historical books (in the English order of the canon). It provides the </div><div class="t m3f x40 h1d yce ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">action-packed account of Israel&apos;s first twenty-five years in Canaan </div><div class="t mc5 x40 h1d ycf ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">(about 1410 B.C. to 1385 B.C.), including the conquest of Canaan </div><div class="t mc6 x40 h1d yd0 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">(lasting about seven years), and the dividing of the inheritance. The </div><div class="t mc7 x40 h1d yd1 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">book climaxes with Joshua&apos;s farewell addresses, delivered near the end </div><div class="t m5 x40 h1d yd2 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of his life, in which Israel&apos;s covenant with God was renewed. </div><div class="t mc8 x11 h1d yd3 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The title of the book derives from its chief human character, Joshua </div><div class="t mc9 x2d h1d yd4 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the son of Nun, Moses&apos; successor and God&apos;s man to lead Israel into </div><div class="t mca x2d h1d yd5 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Canaan. Joshua authored all of the book that bears his name, except for </div><div class="t mcb x2d h1d yd6 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the report of his death (Joshua 24:29-32). That was written probably by </div><div class="t mcc x2d h1d yd7 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Eleazer son of Aaron. The report of Eleazer&apos;s death (verse 33) prob-</div><div class="t mcd x2d h1d yd8 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ably was written by Phinehas. </div><div class="t m81 x10 h1d yd9 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The life and experience of Joshua provides a model of powerful </div><div class="t mce x2d h1d yda ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">spiritual leadership.

The major focus of the book, </div><div class="t md3 x2d h1d ydf ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">however, (whether as history or as type) is not the conquest itself. The </div><div class="t md4 x2d h1d ye0 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">conquest and dividing of the inheritance produce the promised </div><div class="t md5 x2d h1d ye1 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">end—the experience of God&apos;s rest in the land.
