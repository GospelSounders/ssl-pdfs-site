Inside the grass-roofed hut, </div><div class="t m169 x2b hd y4e6 ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">villagers punched machete knives through cracks in the hut&apos;s floor </div><div class="t m145 x18 hd y4e7 ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and walls to drive out the evil spirits. In the corner of the hut, an </div><div class="t m277 x18 hd y8db ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">old man waved burning ginger root over the stomach of a woman </div><div class="t ma4 x2b hd y4e9 ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">curled up on a sleeping mat. A rumble of chants filled the night. </div><div class="t m1bf x2e hd yeb ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Punsoray, lying on her mat, groaned, and the villagers redoubled </div><div class="t m629 x2b hd y4ea ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">their efforts to chase away the evil spirits that tormented her. The </div><div class="t m37a x2b hd y4eb ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">rising noise awoke student missionary Marisa Miller, sleeping in </div><div class="t m62a x2b hd y4ec ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the far end of the village. She made her way to the hut and </div><div class="t m217 x2b hd y8dc ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">examined Punsoray. Then she hurried to our home. </div><div class="t m28e x4b hd y4ca ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;A woman in Tanoy&apos;s house has severe stomach pain,&quot; Marisa </div><div class="t m312 x2b hd y8dd ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">spoke into the darkness. Dawn Holbrook dressed, grabbed her bag, </div><div class="t m45e x2b hd y8de ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and followed the narrow path to Tanoy&apos;s house. She found Punsoray </div><div class="t m21e x2b hd y4ef ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">curled up in a ball, moaning softly. Dawn looked at Tanoy. </div><div class="t m5ed x2e hd y8df ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Is it OK to treat her?&quot; Dawn asked, shouting above the noise. </div><div class="t m20c x2b hd y4f1 ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Tanoy nodded reluctantly. Dawn mixed some charcoal into a glass </div><div class="t m4be x2b hd y8e0 ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of water, then helped Punsoray sit up and drink it. Punsoray made a </div><div class="t m196 x2b hd y8e1 ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">weak protest at the taste of charcoal, then she lay down again. </div><div class="t m330 x2e hd y4f4 ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;May I pray?&quot; Dawn shouted toward Tanoy. Again he nodded. </div><div class="t m1f8 x2b hd y4f5 ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The spirits had not left; it was time to try something else. Dawn </div><div class="t m24f xc hd y4f6 ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">prayed a simple prayer, asking God to heal Punsoray. Then she left </div><div class="t m169 xc hd y8e2 ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the hut, promising to check on her in the morning. </div><div class="t m272 x2e hd y4f8 ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The next morning Dawn walked to Tanoy&apos;s house to check on </div><div class="t m6b xc hd y8e3 ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Punsoray. But Punsoray was not there. Fear gripped Dawn. Had </div><div class="t m223 xc hd y4fa ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the woman died? Had the family taken her somewhere? She began </div><div class="t m2b3 xc hd y8e4 ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">asking, &quot;Where is Punsoray? Have you seen her today?&quot; </div><div class="t m19f x2e hd y4fc ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Yes, she is working in her </div><div class="t m62b xca h3e y4fc ffa fs20 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">kiengan </div><div class="t m39 x5c hd y4fc ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">(mountain garden).&quot; </div><div class="t m287 x2e hd y4fd ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;When did she begin to feel better?&quot; Dawn asked, amazed. The </div><div class="t me6 xc hd y8e5 ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">woman shrugged her shoulders and turned to enter her house. </div><div class="t m4e3 x23 hd y8e6 ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Several weeks later a villager asked Dawn, &quot;Do you remember </div><div class="t mce xc hd y500 ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">when Punsoray was sick, and the evil spirits would not leave her? </div><div class="t m68 xc hd y8e7 ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">You came and prayed for her.&quot; Dawn nodded. &quot;The next day the </div><div class="t m62c xc hd y8e8 ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">news was all over the village. Tanoy had been practicing his </div><div class="t m2c3 xc hd y503 ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">medicine for two hours without results.
