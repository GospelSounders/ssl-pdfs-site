Originally Christ would visit Eden to communicate </div><div class="t m9d x0 h17 y96 ff2 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">with the human family. Sin put an end to this face-to-face communication between </div><div class="t m9e x0 h17 y97 ff2 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">God and man.

God in Christ would once more com-</div><div class="t ma2 x0 h17 y9a ff2 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">mune with man face-to-face. This would neither abolish the law nor negate the </div><div class="t ma3 x0 h17 y9b ff2 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">prophets. They would continue as instruments of instruction, but would yield to the </div><div class="t ma4 x0 h17 y9c ff2 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">glory of the law&apos;s Author and the prophets&apos; Mentor. Men would for 33 brief years be </div><div class="t ma5 x0 h17 y9d ff2 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">brought face-to-face with the substance of the messages of the law and prophets. </div><div class="t ma6 x0 h17 y9e ff2 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The latter were and are in a sense substitute teachers. They are but a pale reflection of </div><div class="t ma7 x0 h17 y9f ff2 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the real. Jesus Christ is the key to both history and prophecy. Compared to Him, the </div><div class="t ma8 x0 h17 ya0 ff2 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">law and the prophets were but satellites about the sun. </div><div class="t ma9 x3d h17 ya1 ff2 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">When Christ ascended on high, the Holy Spirit assumed the primary teaching </div><div class="t maa x0 h17 ya2 ff2 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">function for the church and the world (John 16:13). The church is His medium of </div><div class="t mab x0 h17 ya3 ff2 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">personal communication.
