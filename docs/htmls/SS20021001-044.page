Sisyphus would shove it back up, </div><div class="t m7d x25 h1c y6f ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">only to have it roll down, again and again, the process continuing </div><div class="t m7e x25 h1c y70 ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">forever. The idea was that no punishment could be worse than </div><div class="t m7f x25 h1c y71 ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">futile, hopeless labor. </div><div class="t m80 x39 h1c y72 ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">A few millennia after the story was first told, Frenchman Albert </div><div class="t m81 x25 h1c y73 ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Camus wrote a short book entitled </div><div class="t m82 x3a h1c y74 ff8 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The Myth of Sisyphus. </div><div class="t m83 x3b h1c y74 ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Written </div><div class="t m84 x25 h1c y75 ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">during World War II, the book used Sisyphus as a metaphor of </div><div class="t m85 x25 h1c y76 ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">human existence itself. Because life has no meaning, Camus asked </div><div class="t m86 x25 h1c y77 ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Is it worth living? If all the energy, effort, and passion needed to </div><div class="t m87 x25 h1c y78 ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">exist is like Sisyphus&apos;s labor, hopeless and futile, why bother? </div><div class="t m88 x39 h1c y79 ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Camus has a point, at least, given his premise: If there is no God, </div><div class="t m89 x25 h1c y7a ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">then this existence—with all its trials, pain, perplexities, and absur-</div><div class="t m8a x25 h1c y7b ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">dities—is all that we have and are and, therefore, is meaningless. </div><div class="t m8b x25 h1c y7c ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Our whole essence is contained in, and limited by, our own mortal-</div><div class="t m8c x25 h1c y7d ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ity.

Obviously, not much. </div><div class="t m8f x39 h1c y80 ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Camus, however, wasn&apos;t the only one to realize the futility of </div><div class="t m90 x25 h1c y81 ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">human life in and of itself. Centuries earlier, Paul said the same thing: </div><div class="t m91 x25 h1c y82 ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">If nothing is beyond this life—if death caps it, consummates it, and </div><div class="t m92 x25 h1c y83 ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">finalizes it—then it is all for nothing. If Christ does not come back </div><div class="t m93 x25 h1c y84 ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and raise us from the dead to immortality, then all that we have </div><div class="t m94 x25 h1c y23 ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">believed in and hoped for is, he said, in &quot;vain&quot; (1 Cor. 15:17). </div><div class="t m95 x3c h1c y85 ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Both Paul and Camus both understood the ultimate issue: What is </div><div class="t m96 x25 h1c y86 ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the meaning of this short span of existence known as human life? The </div><div class="t m97 x25 h1c y87 ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">crucial difference, then, is that while Camus had no hope, Paul did, </div><div class="t m29 x35 h1c y88 ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">because Camus (at least when he wrote his essay) did not have Christ </div><div class="t m98 x25 h1c y89 ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">while Paul did—and that&apos;s why Paul (and all the other Bible writers) </div><div class="t m99 x35 h1c y8a ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">could express in their writings a wonderful optimism and hope amid </div><div class="t m9a x35 h1c y8b ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">a world limping along in death, decay, and suffering. </div><div class="t m9b x3c h1c y8c ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">This quarter, we look at that hope, a hope not in ourselves or in </div><div class="t m9c x35 h1c y8d ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">anything we can do but a hope rooted and grounded in Jesus Christ, </div><div class="t m9d x35 h1c y8e ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">who &quot;gave himself for our sins&quot; (Gal. 1:4), whose life and death at </div><div class="t m9e x35 h1c y8f ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">His first coming is our surety of resurrection and eternity at His </div><div class="t m9f x35 h1c y90 ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">second coming.
