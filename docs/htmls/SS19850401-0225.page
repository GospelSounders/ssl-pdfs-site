It also makes it clear that everybody </div><div class="t m28b x91 h26 y3ea ff2 fs18 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">is endowed, and no one can claim that he has been overlooked in the </div><div class="t maa x91 h26 y3eb ff2 fs18 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">distribution of natural talents. Furthermore, the pounds that were lent by </div><div class="t m24f x91 h26 y3ec ff2 fs18 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the noblemen proved to be tests of faithfulness, and the different use </div><div class="t m114 x91 h26 y3ed ff2 fs18 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">made of them caused greater reward to flow to the good and faithful ser-</div><div class="t mcb x91 h26 y3ee ff2 fs18 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">vants. In a sense the talents or pounds that the servants received were </div><div class="t m366 x91 h26 y3ef ff2 fs18 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">really theirs and were retained by them. But the noblemen put them out </div><div class="t m152 x91 h26 y3f0 ff2 fs18 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">on permanent loan for the faithful use of the servants.
