An Adventist woman stood in a long line to </div><div class="t m346 x4e hb y4c9 ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">buy milk. When she finally reached the front of the line, she gave </div><div class="t m97d x4e hb y40a ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">her order and paid the clerk for her milk. But the clerk gave her </div><div class="t mb1 x4e hb ya98 ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">too much in change. When she tried to return the extra money, the </div><div class="t mc7 x4e hb y40c ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">clerk brushed her aside; she was busy with another customer. The </div><div class="t m8f6 x4e hb y40d ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">woman waited quietly until the clerk had finished with the cus-</div><div class="t m4a x4e hb y40e ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tomer, then called her attention to the overpayment. The clerk </div><div class="t m6b4 x4e hb y40f ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">took the money, thanked her curtly, then turned to the next cus-</div><div class="t m2f5 x4e hb y410 ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tomer. The Adventist woman smiled and turned to leave the store. </div><div class="t m3d0 x22 hb y411 ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Two students standing in line had watched her. They wondered </div><div class="t m410 x2 hb y6b5 ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">why this woman returned the money. Most people would have </div><div class="t m561 x2 hb y412 ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">been glad for some extra change! </div><div class="t m355 x22 hb y413 ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The following day the woman stood near the front of the same </div><div class="t m3db x2 hb y47d ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">line when a weary young mother carrying a little child in her arm </div><div class="t m393 x2 hb y47e ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">approached the front of the line. When the clerk saw her, she </div><div class="t m2e9 x2 hb y4d1 ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">scolded her sharply and demanded that she wait in line like </div><div class="t m8b x2 hb y415 ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">everyone else. The Adventist woman felt sorry for the weary </div><div class="t m6f0 x2 hb y416 ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">young mother and offered her place in line. Then she walked to </div><div class="t m34e x2 hb y417 ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the end of the line and began her wait all over. </div><div class="t m6a3 x17 hb y418 ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The same two students who had seen the money incident the </div><div class="t m52f x2 hb ya99 ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">previous day, watched in amazement as this Christian woman </div><div class="t m1a5 x2 hb y41a ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">again acted generously to a stranger. They decided they had to </div><div class="t m976 xad hb y41b ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">know what motives prompted such unusual behavior. They fol-</div><div class="t m97e xad hb ya9a ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">lowed the woman home and explained that they had seen her in </div><div class="t ma2 xad hb y41d ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the market. They wondered why she was so different. She invited </div><div class="t m120 xad hb ya9b ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">them into her home and answered their questions. During their </div><div class="t m809 xad hb ya9c ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">conversation, she shared her faith in Jesus. As the students were </div><div class="t m459 xad hb ya9d ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">leaving, she invited them to come back again. </div><div class="t m30c x17 hb ya9e ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The students returned several times. In time they asked if they </div><div class="t m7e4 xad hb ya9f ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">could attend church with her so they could learn more about </div><div class="t me4 xad hb yaa0 ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Jesus, who made such a difference in her life. </div><div class="t m528 x52 hb yaa1 ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">We never know when we are being a testimony to others. </div><div class="t m360 xad hb yaa2 ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Through our prayers we can strengthen others as they witness to </div><div class="t m9d xad hb yaa3 ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">their faith.
