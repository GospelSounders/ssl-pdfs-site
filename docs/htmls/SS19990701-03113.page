Recently I </div><div class="t m73c x22 h1d y99d ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sat in a church filled with worshipers. But three of the church workers </div><div class="t m65e x22 h1d y4b9 ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">were not present; they were imprisoned for their faith. The Bibles the </div><div class="t m324 x22 h1d y4ba ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">members so reverently held were smuggled into the country, for the </div><div class="t m217 x22 h1d y99e ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">government does not permit the publishing of religious literature. </div><div class="t m1eb x16 h1d y4bc ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">In another country I visited a little house on the edge of a city. Each </div><div class="t m73d x22 h1d y4bd ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Sabbath members secretly entered the house to worship; they sang in </div><div class="t m362 x22 h1d y99f ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">whispers to prevent detection. Then one day police raided the house </div><div class="t mc0 x22 h1d y4bf ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and arrested the pastor.

One night as she returned from the meeting, her father </div><div class="t m123 x22 h1d y9a3 ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">met her and tried to drag her to the barn for another whipping.

I prayed that the police had not </div><div class="t m247 xb h1d y4d3 ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">seen me enter the apartment. It would have been far too dangerous to </div><div class="t m745 xb h1d y4d4 ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">visit the secret house church.
