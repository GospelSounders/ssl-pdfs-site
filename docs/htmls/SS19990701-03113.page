Recently I </div><div class="t m73c x23 h20 y99e ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sat in a church filled with worshipers. But three of the church workers </div><div class="t m65e x23 h20 y4ba ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">were not present; they were imprisoned for their faith. The Bibles the </div><div class="t m324 x23 h20 y4bb ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">members so reverently held were smuggled into the country, for the </div><div class="t m217 x23 h20 y99f ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">government does not permit the publishing of religious literature. </div><div class="t m1eb x17 h20 y4bd ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">In another country I visited a little house on the edge of a city.

One night as she returned from the meeting, her father </div><div class="t m123 x23 h20 y9a4 ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">met her and tried to drag her to the barn for another whipping.
