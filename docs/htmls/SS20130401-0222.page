So, on Sabbath morning she took her five </div><div class="t m0 x60 h36 y376 ff10 fs3 fc3 sc0 ls2 ws58">children to the meetings instead of to her own church. When the pastor </div><div class="t m0 x60 h36 y377 ff10 fs3 fc3 sc0 ls2 wsfe">invited those who wanted special prayer to come forward, Pamela took </div><div class="t m0 x60 h36 y378 ff10 fs3 fc3 sc0 ls2 wse4">her children to the front.
