(See </div><div class="t m222 xb9 h19 yaca ff4 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Luke 10:5, 6.) This peace is not just an absence of war, though </div><div class="t m5f2 x3e h19 yacb ff4 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that is part of it. The peace Christians are urged to seek and to </div><div class="t m772 xb9 h19 yacc ff4 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">pursue for all men (Ps. 34:14) is the peace given to us by our Lord </div><div class="t m80c xb9 h19 yacd ff4 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Jesus Christ, the Prince of Peace (John 14:27).

Col. 3:15; 1 Cor. 6:1-8; Phil. 2:1-5. </div><div class="t m80d x2e h19 yad2 ff4 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Though Christians do have a very positive attitude toward </div><div class="t m1ce xb9 h19 yad3 ff4 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">government, they nevertheless are urged not to seek arbitration </div><div class="t m1fd xb9 h19 yad4 ff4 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">outside of their communion of faith. A number of reasons are </div><div class="t m200 x7b h19 yad5 ff4 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">given. First, believers ought to be an example to the world—</div><div class="t m615 x7b h19 yad6 ff4 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">examples of peace, fellowship, and love. If society cannot see </div><div class="t m52c x7b h19 yad7 ff4 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">these exemplified in the church, then where would they find such </div><div class="t m80e x7b h19 yad8 ff4 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">a model? Second, government agencies are definitely of a lower </div><div class="t m5ec x7b h19 yad9 ff4 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">order than the church. The apostle speaks of the &quot;unrighteous&quot; </div><div class="t m271 x7b h19 yada ff4 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">(1 Cor. 6:1, RSV), &quot;unjust&quot; (KJV), and of those who are &quot;least </div><div class="t m3d1 x7b h19 yadb ff4 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">esteemed by the church&quot; (6:4). Third, it puts the whole church </div><div class="t m220 x7b h19 yadc ff4 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to shame if we cannot find persons wise enough in the church to </div><div class="t mdf x7b h19 yadd ff4 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">decide between members who have conflicts with each other (6:5, </div><div class="t mc5 x7b h19 yade ff4 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">6). It actually is a defeat for the gospel. Finally, Christians have </div><div class="t m3a9 x7b h19 y65 ff4 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to learn to have the mind of Christ, in humility counting others </div><div class="t m42c x47 h19 yadf ff4 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">better than themselves, having other people&apos;s interest in mind, </div><div class="t m777 x47 h19 yae0 ff4 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">suffering wrong and being defrauded rather than to be wrong </div><div class="t m80f x47 h19 yae1 ff4 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">themselves (6:7-9). The church ought to set an example to the </div><div class="t m5c4 x47 h19 yae2 ff4 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">government and to society as a whole, rather than turn to them for </div><div class="t m1ca x7b h19 yae3 ff4 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">justice. </div><div class="t m362 x7a h1a yae4 ff3 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">In what ways can Christians best promote peace?
