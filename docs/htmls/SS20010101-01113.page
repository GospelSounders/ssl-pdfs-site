H. Zachary </div><div class="t m71c x2c hd ya20 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">INDIA—As Pastor Baka visited the villages in his new district in a </div><div class="t m71d xc hd ya21 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">remote area of southeastern India, he was met with curiosity, but little </div><div class="t m71e xc hd ya22 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">interest in religion. &quot;We have no place for your God here,&quot; one man </div><div class="t m71f xc hd ya23 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">told him. But one villager, Samuel, was a Christian who had prayed </div><div class="t m51a xc hd ya24 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">for five years that God would send a pastor. Together the men held </div><div class="t m720 xc hd ya25 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">meetings, and 200 people attended. When the pastor asked for those </div><div class="t m6f4 xc hd ya26 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">who wanted to follow Christ in baptism, 35 villagers stepped forward. </div><div class="t m62b x9c hd ya27 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">On the day of the baptism, the entire village gathered at a lake to </div><div class="t m391 xc hd ya28 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">watch the baptism. Samuel and his family were baptized first, then a </div><div class="t m721 xc hd ya29 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">woman stepped into the water. When the pastor raised her out of the </div><div class="t m5c2 xc hd ya2a ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">water, she suddenly cried out in alarm. &quot;My wedding ring is gone! If I </div><div class="t m722 xc hd ya2b ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">go home without it, my husband will beat me!&quot; she wailed. </div><div class="t m5f9 x2c hd ya2c ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Our God can do anything,&quot; Pastor Baka assured her. &quot;If it is His </div><div class="t m663 xc hd ya2d ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">will, He will show us where your ring is.&quot; When he finished baptizing </div><div class="t m716 xc hd ya2e ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the new believers, he joined them on the shore and asked them to form </div><div class="t m70 xc hd ya2f ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">a circle for prayer. He prayed that God would reveal His power and </div><div class="t m723 xc hd ya30 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">glory and show them where the woman&apos;s wedding ring was. </div><div class="t m442 x9c hd ya31 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The pastor told two young boys to go into the water and stand on </div><div class="t m2ce xc hd ya32 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the spot where he had baptized the new believers. &quot;Reach into the </div><div class="t m4e xc hd ya33 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">water and bring up a fistful of sand,&quot; he said. The youth did as they </div><div class="t m539 x96 hd ya34 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">were told, but they found no ring. &quot;Reach in again and bring up more </div><div class="t m6df x96 hd ya35 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sand,&quot; he said. </div><div class="t m4c4 x9c hd ya36 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The villagers watched as the boys searched the lake bottom hand-</div><div class="t m5ab x96 hd ya37 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ful by handful. Could the God of the Christians find a small ring in the </div><div class="t m724 x96 hd ya38 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sandy bottom of the lake? The crowd pressed closer. Suddenly one of </div><div class="t m621 x96 hd ya39 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the boys shouted, &quot;I found it!&quot; He held up the woman&apos;s ring. </div><div class="t m3d x29 hd ya3a ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The happy woman cried, &quot;My God Jesus Christ!
