But one villager, Samuel, was a Christian who had prayed </div><div class="t m51a xd hf ya25 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">for five years that God would send a pastor. Together the men held </div><div class="t m720 xd hf ya26 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">meetings, and 200 people attended. When the pastor asked for those </div><div class="t m6f4 xd hf ya27 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">who wanted to follow Christ in baptism, 35 villagers stepped forward. </div><div class="t m62b x9d hf ya28 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">On the day of the baptism, the entire village gathered at a lake to </div><div class="t m391 xd hf ya29 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">watch the baptism. Samuel and his family were baptized first, then a </div><div class="t m721 xd hf ya2a ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">woman stepped into the water. When the pastor raised her out of the </div><div class="t m5c2 xd hf ya2b ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">water, she suddenly cried out in alarm. &quot;My wedding ring is gone! If I </div><div class="t m722 xd hf ya2c ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">go home without it, my husband will beat me!&quot; she wailed. </div><div class="t m5f9 x2d hf ya2d ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Our God can do anything,&quot; Pastor Baka assured her. &quot;If it is His </div><div class="t m663 xd hf ya2e ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">will, He will show us where your ring is.&quot; When he finished baptizing </div><div class="t m716 xd hf ya2f ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the new believers, he joined them on the shore and asked them to form </div><div class="t m70 xd hf ya30 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">a circle for prayer. He prayed that God would reveal His power and </div><div class="t m723 xd hf ya31 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">glory and show them where the woman&apos;s wedding ring was. </div><div class="t m442 x9d hf ya32 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The pastor told two young boys to go into the water and stand on </div><div class="t m2ce xd hf ya33 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the spot where he had baptized the new believers. &quot;Reach into the </div><div class="t m4e xd hf ya34 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">water and bring up a fistful of sand,&quot; he said. The youth did as they </div><div class="t m539 x97 hf ya35 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">were told, but they found no ring. &quot;Reach in again and bring up more </div><div class="t m6df x97 hf ya36 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sand,&quot; he said. </div><div class="t m4c4 x9d hf ya37 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The villagers watched as the boys searched the lake bottom hand-</div><div class="t m5ab x97 hf ya38 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ful by handful.

Suddenly one of </div><div class="t m621 x97 hf ya3a ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the boys shouted, &quot;I found it!&quot; He held up the woman&apos;s ring. </div><div class="t m3d x2a hf ya3b ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The happy woman cried, &quot;My God Jesus Christ!
