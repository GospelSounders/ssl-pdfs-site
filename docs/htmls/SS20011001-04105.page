For the moment, at least, he was safe. He thanked God for </div><div class="t m417 x6b h22 y80e ff3 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">saving his life and asked God to forgive him for all his wrong deeds. He </div><div class="t m696 x6b h22 y678 ff3 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">felt utterly unworthy of God&apos;s forgiveness, but he prayed, &quot;God, Your </div><div class="t m14a x6b h22 y679 ff3 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">will be done. But if You save my life, I will follow You.&quot; </div><div class="t m4c2 x6d h22 y810 ff3 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Celedonio realized that the sandbar could disappear any moment </div><div class="t m261 x6b h22 y811 ff3 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">under the rising water. He slipped into the water and let the current </div><div class="t m725 x6b h22 yaa ff3 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">carry him along as he swam toward the shore. He could feel his </div><div class="t m288 x6b h22 y60f ff3 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">strength ebbing. Just as he thought he could go no farther, his foot </div><div class="t m19d x6b h22 y698 ff3 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">touched the river bottom. </div><div class="t m384 x6d h22 y812 ff3 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Celedonio returned home to his family, determined to keep his </div><div class="t m726 x6b h22 y67d ff3 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">promise to God. He learned about a Bible class being offered by </div><div class="t m4d7 x6b h22 y813 ff3 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Adventists and decided to attend. The Bible studies thrilled him. He </div><div class="t m727 x6b h22 y814 ff3 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">accepted the truths of God and was baptized. As his wife saw the </div><div class="t m6de x6b h22 y815 ff3 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">difference Christ made in Celedonio&apos;s life, she joined him. With his </div><div class="t m278 x62 h22 y816 ff3 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">family united in God, Celedonio answered God&apos;s call to preach the </div><div class="t m516 x6b h22 y817 ff3 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">gospel. </div><div class="t m551 x6d h22 y570 ff3 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The family moved to a small town where no Adventists lived. They </div><div class="t mbd x62 h22 y818 ff3 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">visited their neighbors and talked about Christ. But their efforts met </div><div class="t m728 x62 h22 y819 ff3 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">with rejection. In time discouragement threatened to overwhelm </div><div class="t m19c x62 h22 y81a ff3 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Celedonio. He asked the local church headquarters for help. With a </div><div class="t m3a9 x62 h22 y90e ff3 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">promise that someone would come to help him, Celedonio returned to </div><div class="t m213 x62 h22 y81b ff3 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">his work with new courage. He continued visiting and praying, and a </div><div class="t m69c x62 h22 y90f ff3 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">few people began to show an interest. One man, after listening to </div><div class="t m471 x62 h22 y81d ff3 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Celedonio explain God&apos;s claim on human hearts, closed his liquor </div><div class="t m43a x62 h22 ybc ff3 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">store and converted it into a meeting house for believers. </div><div class="t m23b x74 h22 y81f ff3 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Encouraged, Celedonio announced evangelistic meetings. But the </div><div class="t m50e x62 h22 y3f5 ff3 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">promised evangelist did not arrive, and Celedonio prepared to hold the </div><div class="t m24d x62 h22 yff ff3 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">meetings himself. </div><div class="t m38c x74 h22 y820 ff3 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Late that day a lone woman walked into town. Someone pointed her </div><div class="t m229 x62 h22 y821 ff3 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to the former tavern where Celedonio was preparing for the meeting. </div><div class="t m21d x62 h22 y822 ff3 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">She was Maria, the promised Bible worker. She gave Bible studies to </div><div class="t m4ce x62 h22 y823 ff3 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">24 people. Of these, 17 have been baptized.
