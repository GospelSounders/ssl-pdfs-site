But the words receive the impress </div><div class="t m0 x12 h50 y294 ff15 fs4 fc3 sc0 lsf ws97">of the individual mind. The divine mind is diffused.

Consider, for </div><div class="t m0 x12 h5 y29b ff14 fs4 fc3 sc0 ls9 ws5f">example, the wording of the inscription above Jesus’ cross as depicted </div><div class="t m0 x12 h5 y29c ff14 fs4 fc3 sc0 ls9 wse1">in the Gospels. According to Matthew 27:37, it said, “THIS IS JESUS </div><div class="t m0 x12 h5 y29d ff14 fs4 fc3 sc0 ls9 ws2e">THE KING OF THE JEWS”; according to Mark 15:26, “THE KING </div><div class="t m0 x12 h5 y29e ff14 fs4 fc3 sc0 ls9 ws29">OF THE JEWS”; according to Luke 23:38, “THIS IS THE KING OF </div><div class="t m0 x12 h5 y29f ff14 fs4 fc3 sc0 ls9 ws6">THE JEWS.” How are we to understand these differences? </div><div class="t m0 x54 h5 y2a0 ff14 fs4 fc3 sc0 ls9 wse1">As the Bible says, “all Scripture is given by inspiration of God” and </div><div class="t m0 x12 h5 y2a1 ff14 fs4 fc3 sc0 ls9 ws88">is trustworthy; yet, we are given different accounts of the inscription on </div><div class="t m0 x12 h5 y2a2 ff14 fs4 fc3 sc0 ls9 ws4e">Jesus’ cross. These two points together can give us insight into the way </div><div class="t m0 x12 h5 y2a3 ff14 fs4 fc3 sc0 ls9 wse2">in which inspiration works. This case shows that inspiration permits dif<span class="ls2 ws3">-</span></div><div class="t m0 x12 h5 y2a4 ff14 fs4 fc3 sc0 ls9 ws6">ferent expressions of an idea or event to the extent that the expressions </div><div class="t m0 x12 h5 y2a5 ff14 fs4 fc3 sc0 ls9 wse3">adequately depict it. When a general approximation is an adequate </div><div class="t m0 x12 h5 y2a6 ff14 fs4 fc3 sc0 ls9 wse4">expression, as in the inscriptions on the cross, inspiration accommo<span class="ls2 ws3">-</span></div><div class="t m0 x12 h5 y2a7 ff14 fs4 fc3 sc0 ls9 ws87">dates it. On the other hand, where specificity is required, as in 1 Kings </div><div class="t m0 x12 h5 y2a8 ff14 fs4 fc3 sc0 ls9 ws6">6:1, inspiration provides it and should be accepted as such.</div><div class="t m27 x58 h4e y2a9 ff16 fs2d fc9 sc0 ls2 ws3">Compare</div><div class="t m0 x65 h50 y2a9 ff15 fs4 fc3 sc0 ls2 wse5"> Acts 1:18 and Matthew 27:5.

However, recent research has </div><div class="t m0 x12 h5 y2ae ff14 fs4 fc3 sc0 ls9 ws31">shown that the word translated as “falling headlong” in Acts 1:18 also </div><div class="t m0 x12 h5 y2af ff14 fs4 fc3 sc0 ls9 ws31">means “swelling up.” Therefore, it’s likely that, after hanging himself, </div><div class="t m0 x12 h5 y2b0 ff14 fs4 fc3 sc0 ls9 ws67">Judas was not discovered until his corpse had swelled up, causing his </div><div class="t m0 x12 h5 y2b1 ff14 fs4 fc3 sc0 ls9 ws1b">intestines to burst open.

The vast majority of the Bible is </div><div class="t m0 x12 h5 y2b3 ff14 fs4 fc3 sc0 ls9 ws3b">not problematic. In the few places where some questions remain about </div><div class="t m0 x12 h5 y2b4 ff14 fs4 fc3 sc0 ls9 wse7">apparent “errors” or “contradictions,” the prudent attitude would be </div><div class="t m0 x12 h5 y2b5 ff14 fs4 fc3 sc0 ls9 ws36">humility.
