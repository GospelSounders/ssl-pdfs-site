The day of miracles is not over.

The children and their sponsors left </div><div class="t mcb x7 h1f y6d5 ff3 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">their school at 7:00 a.m., too early to prepare a breakfast of boiled </div><div class="t m28c x7 h1f y6d6 ff3 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sweet potatoes, so Edwin went without eating. The boys and girls </div><div class="t m51f x7 h1f y6d7 ff3 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">returned to the school just in time for their own Sabbath School </div><div class="t m46a x7 h1f y6d8 ff3 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and church service. Edwin tried to concentrate on the preacher&apos;s </div><div class="t m519 x7 h1f y6d9 ff3 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sermon, but his stomach began to rumble.

It would take two hours to peel and boil a sweet potato </div><div class="t m521 x7 h1f y6df ff3 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">for lunch, and Edwin was not sure he could wait that long to eat. </div><div class="t m522 x7 h1f y6e0 ff3 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">As he walked, he remembered that his Friend, Jesus, knew all </div><div class="t m38b x7 h1f y6e1 ff3 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">about his growling stomach. He stopped along the path, closed his </div><div class="t m523 x7 h1f y6e2 ff3 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">eyes, and told God how hungry he was. He did not ask God for </div><div class="t m524 x7 h1f y6e3 ff3 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">food; he knew that Jesus would know what to do about his </div><div class="t m290 x7 h1f y6e4 ff3 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">problem. </div><div class="t m46e x40 h1f y6e5 ff3 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">As Edwin began walking again he heard a bird singing in the </div><div class="t m525 x7 h1f y6e6 ff3 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tree overhead. He stopped and watched the bird. Then he saw a </div><div class="t m451 x7 h1f y6e7 ff3 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">yellow leaf flutter down from the tree and land beside the path. He </div><div class="t m526 x7 h1f y6e8 ff3 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">walked over to pick up the leaf, and noticed a little bundle lying on </div><div class="t m527 x7 h1f y6e9 ff3 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the ground near where the leaf had fallen. He bent down to </div><div class="t m528 x47 h1f y6ea ff3 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">examine the bundle and found two nicely-made sandwiches. He </div><div class="t m519 x47 h1f y6eb ff3 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">looked around, but saw no one nearby who could own the lunch. </div><div class="t m339 x21 h1f y6ec ff3 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Edwin picked up the bundle and held it in his hands. While his </div><div class="t m529 x47 h1f y49a ff3 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">stomach growled for food, he closed his eyes and thanked Jesus </div><div class="t m7b x47 h1f y6ed ff3 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">for providing lunch for him. Then he sat down and enjoyed the </div><div class="t m51d x47 h1f y49c ff3 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">meal that Jesus had left for him.
