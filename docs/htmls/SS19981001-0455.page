When she learned about Jesus Christ, she wanted </div><div class="t m22b x34 hc y5f0 ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to follow Him. In doing so, she led her mother to Christ as well. </div><div class="t m110 x31 hc y5f1 ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Shortly after Communism fell in Lithuania, Eglute&apos;s mother </div><div class="t m235 x35 hc y5f2 ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">heard about some Bible lectures and decided to go. Eglute wanted </div><div class="t m2df x34 hc y5f3 ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to go, too, but she was just seven years old then, and her mother </div><div class="t m174 x34 hc y5f4 ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">wondered if she could sit still through the meetings. </div><div class="t m4c3 x31 hc y5f5 ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">As they entered the lecture hall, Eglute&apos;s mother noticed that no </div><div class="t m520 x35 hc y303 ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">other children were present. She worried that Eglute would be </div><div class="t m25b x35 hc y304 ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">bored, but the little girl was fascinated with the slides of the </div><div class="t m296 x35 hc y5f6 ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ancient city of Petra and listened carefully to the lecture. After the </div><div class="t m34c x35 hc y5f7 ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">meeting a lady invited Eglute to the special children&apos;s meetings, </div><div class="t m138 x35 hc y5f8 ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">but Eglute wanted to attend the adult meetings. </div><div class="t m29f x31 hc y5f9 ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Eglute attended all the lectures with her mother. She heard the </div><div class="t m30 x35 hc y5fa ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">speaker explain the importance of following Christ. When he </div><div class="t m31a x35 hc y5fb ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">asked who wanted to follow Jesus, Eglute raised her hand. When </div><div class="t m282 x35 hc y5fc ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the speaker presented the topic of baptism, Eglute again raised her </div><div class="t m2e4 x35 hc y5fd ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">hand; she wanted to obey Jesus and be baptized. </div><div class="t m42e x2a hc y30d ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Later at home Eglute told her mother she wanted to follow </div><div class="t m348 x35 hc y5fe ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Jesus and be baptized. When Mother told her that seven years old </div><div class="t m163 x35 hc y5ff ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">is too young to be baptized, Eglute began to cry. Mother tried to </div><div class="t m134 x35 hc y600 ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">console her, but Eglute could not be persuaded to wait. </div><div class="t m521 x2a hc y601 ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Eglute&apos;s mother talked to the pastor about her child&apos;s wish to be </div><div class="t m158 x35 hc y602 ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">baptized. He agreed that probably she was a little young, but he </div><div class="t m16a x35 hc y603 ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">asked Mother, &quot;Have you considered baptism?&quot; Eglute&apos;s mother </div><div class="t mf9 x35 hc y604 ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">shook her head; she had not seriously considered it. </div><div class="t m522 x2a hc y605 ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Later at home, Eglute began to talk to her mother about follow-</div><div class="t m3b1 x35 hc y606 ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ing Jesus. &quot;You really should do what Jesus says,&quot; Eglute would </div><div class="t me5 x35 hc y317 ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">urge her mother.
