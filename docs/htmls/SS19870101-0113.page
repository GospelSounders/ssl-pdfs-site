(See Luke 24:25-27.) In fact, the main message of the </div><div class="t m1b4 x4a h1e y1ba ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Old Testament is that God will send a Deliverer who will save His people from </div><div class="t m176 x4a h1e y1bb ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">their sins. (See 1 Pet. 1:10-12.) In our study of the Book of Daniel we shall see </div><div class="t m1b5 x4a h1e y1bc ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that prophecy clearly predicts the time of the coming of the Messiah and His </div><div class="t m1b6 x4a h1e y1bd ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">work. Jesus as the Messiah is the center and core of the Old Testament as well as </div><div class="t m1b7 x4a h1e y1be ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of the New. Our first endeavor when studying Bible prophecy should be to dis-</div><div class="t m195 x4a h1e y1bf ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">cover how the prophecy centers in Christ. </div><div class="t m112 x1b h1f y1c0 ff1 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">2. </div><div class="t m23 x26 h1f y1c1 ff1 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Must Recognize Signs and Symbols. </div><div class="t m16f x1b h1e y1c2 ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">In dealing with His people God uses signs and symbols to impress important </div><div class="t m1a1 x4a h1e y1c3 ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">truths upon the people. Thus, after the flood, He made a covenant that He would </div><div class="t m1b8 x4a h1e y1c4 ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">never destroy the world with a flood again. He set a rainbow in the sky as a sign </div><div class="t med x4a h1e y1c5 ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">or token of His promise (Gen. 9:12, 13). He said that the Sabbath was to be kept </div><div class="t m1b9 x4a h1e y1c6 ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">as a sign of sanctification—the symbol of a close relationship between Himself </div><div class="t ma7 x4a h1e y1c7 ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and His people. The entire sacrificial system was full of symbolism to show that </div><div class="t m1ba x4a h1e y1c8 ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">without the shedding of blood there could be no remission of sins. (See Heb. </div><div class="t m13c x4a h1e y1c9 ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">9:22.) Miracles often were used as signs of God&apos;s power and the authenticity of </div><div class="t m1bb x4a h1e y1ca ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">His word. (See 2 Kings 20:1-11; Isa. 7:11-14.) Furthermore, God communi-</div><div class="t m1bc x4a h1e y1cb ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">cated with people through dreams in which symbols were used. (See Gen. 37:5-</div><div class="t m1bd x4a h1e y1cc ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">10.) </div><div class="t m53 x1b h1e y8a ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Thus we are not surprised to find dreams and miracles in Daniel. In fact, the </div><div class="t m1be x4a h1e y1cd ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">miracles seemingly are as unforgettable to us as they must have been to those </div><div class="t m101 x4a h1e y1ce ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">who observed them in actuality. </div><div class="t m1bf x1b h1e y1cf ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Symbols are remembered easily and serve as pictures that we can store in the </div><div class="t m11b x4a h1e y1d0 ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">mind and thus recall the lessons they teach. Remember how effective Jesus was </div><div class="t m122 x4a h1e y1d1 ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">as a teacher because He taught in parables. Prophetic symbols can be misapplied </div><div class="t m117 x4a h1e y1d2 ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">easily. One of the best ways to keep from doing so is to study carefully how the </div><div class="t med x4a h1e y1d3 ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Bible writers and those who interpreted them in Bible days used and understood </div><div class="t m1c0 x4a h1e y1d4 ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the symbols involved. </div><div class="t m114 x1b h1f y4f ff1 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">3. </div><div class="t m32 x26 h1f y1d5 ff1 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Must Recognize That Some Prophecies Are Conditional. </div><div class="t m1c1 x1b h1e y1d6 ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">God promised Israel that the chosen nation would become the center of a </div><div class="t m1c2 x4a h1e y1d7 ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">worldwide reformation, would be delivered from all enemies, and would be-</div><div class="t m1c3 x71 h1e y1d8 ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">come the center of the Messiah&apos;s kingdom.
