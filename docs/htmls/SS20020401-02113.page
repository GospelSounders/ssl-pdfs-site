H. Zachary </div><div class="t m3b5 x2f h1e y2a8 ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">As a young man, Jeorge Ratarciuc joined a radical religious group </div><div class="t m44c x13 h1e y2a9 ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in Romania called God&apos;s Army. For some 30 years he and his wife </div><div class="t m3e2 x13 h1e y281 ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">were active members. Jeorge sincerely tried to understand and follow </div><div class="t m315 x13 h1e y2aa ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the teachings of the Bible, but as he studied, he discovered that the </div><div class="t md5 x13 h1e ya7c ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">organization to which he belonged did not follow God&apos;s command-</div><div class="t m3ee x13 h1e y982 ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ments. Jeorge wondered if any religious group followed everything </div><div class="t m7c9 x13 h1e y180 ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the Bible taught. </div><div class="t m332 x2f h1e y2ab ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">He asked his priests, &quot;Why do we not follow the Bible in our </div><div class="t m265 x13 h1e ya7d ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">church?&quot; The priests had no satisfactory answer, so Jeorge asked </div><div class="t m447 x13 h1e ya7e ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">other priests. Again he received no clear answers. </div><div class="t m5eb x2f h1e ya7f ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Jeorge&apos;s study convinced him that reverencing the icons, pic-</div><div class="t m230 x13 h1e y2ad ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tures of saints, violated the second commandment. He asked his </div><div class="t m4cb x13 h1e ya80 ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">priests for scriptural support for this practice. But they could </div><div class="t m33d x13 h1e ya81 ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">provide none. </div><div class="t m7ca x2f h1e y71b ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">As a lay preacher in his church, Jeorge presented sermons when </div><div class="t m7cb x13 h1e ya82 ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the priests were not available. He could not conscientiously teach </div><div class="t m7cc x13 h1e ya83 ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">others to follow traditions he himself did not believe in. So when he </div><div class="t m2c7 x13 h1e ya84 ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">preached, he urged his listeners to search the Bible for answers to </div><div class="t m7cd x13 h1e y997 ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">their questions. But soon Jeorge decided that he could no longer be a </div><div class="t m634 x4a h1e y2fa ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">leader in his church. He decided to leave God&apos;s Army. </div><div class="t m7cd x2f h1e ya85 ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Jeorge knew a few Adventists in his village, but he did not at first </div><div class="t m3ac x13 h1e y294 ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">consider seeking them out, for he was not convinced that they kept all </div><div class="t m7ce x13 h1e y2fd ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of the Ten Commandments. After all, they did not honor Sunday, the </div><div class="t m733 x4a h1e y2fe ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">day he understood to be the Lord&apos;s Day. Jeorge visited other Protes-</div><div class="t m777 x4a h1e ya86 ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tant churches, but he could not find one that followed the Bible and </div><div class="t m5fa x4a h1e y297 ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">honored the Ten Commandments. </div><div class="t m262 x2f h1e ya87 ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Then he attended some evangelistic meetings, and there he dis-</div><div class="t m3b1 x4a h1e ya88 ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">covered that the Adventist Church honored all of the Ten Command-</div><div class="t m3 x4a h1e ya89 ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ments and ordered their lives and worship according to the Bible. </div><div class="t m7cf x4a h1e y299 ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Jeorge joyfully called his family together and told his 1 I children and </div><div class="t m3b1 x4a h1e y43f ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">their spouses that he planned to become an Adventist. After studying </div><div class="t m7d0 x4a h1e ya8a ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">together, Jeorge rejoiced when all of his children and their spouses </div><div class="t m7d1 x4a h1e ya8b ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">joined him in his decision. Recently, the entire family were baptized </div><div class="t m5a7 x4a h1e y29d ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">together. </div><div class="t m424 x2f h1e y29e ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Jeorge is reaching out to his friends in God&apos;s Army, praying for </div><div class="t m587 x4a h1e ya8c ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">them and inviting them to become soldiers in the Lord&apos;s real army. </div><div class="t m9a x2f h12 ya8d ff5 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">J.
