H. Zachary </div><div class="t m68d x29 hb y395 ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Far from home and serving in the Russian army, Igor Pashkin had </div><div class="t m39e x3f hb y9cb ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">a lot of time to think. His lifelong acceptance of atheism wrestled </div><div class="t m68e x3f hb y9cc ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">with the concept of God. Gradually he became convinced that life is </div><div class="t m25a x41 hb y9cd ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the work of a super intelligence. But who or what was it? He sought </div><div class="t m37 x3f hb y513 ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">an answer in the Russian Orthodox Church, but he had no personal </div><div class="t m68f x3f hb y42c ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">relationship with God. </div><div class="t m30 x29 hb y42d ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Igor returned to his home in Omsk and enrolled in the university </div><div class="t m344 x3f hb y515 ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to study English. When he learned that an Australian pastor was </div><div class="t m17b x3f hb y516 ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">conducting evangelistic meetings in the city, he decided to go. It </div><div class="t m643 x3f hb y517 ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">would be a good chance to improve his English. </div><div class="t m11a x29 hb y518 ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">He enjoyed listening to the English speaker. When he spoke on </div><div class="t m268 x41 hb y9ce ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the prophecy of Daniel 2, Igor recognized the empires that rose and </div><div class="t m315 x41 hb y9cf ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">fellâ€”Medo-Persia, Greece, Rome. This prophecy offered compel-</div><div class="t m614 x41 hb y9d0 ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ling evidence that the Bible is true. From that time on Igor attended </div><div class="t m690 x41 hb y9d1 ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the meetings for another reason: to learn more about the Bible. </div><div class="t m691 x49 hb y9d2 ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">When the pastor invited listeners to follow Jesus in baptism, Igor </div><div class="t m17c x41 hb y43 ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">stepped forward. That night he told his wife of his decision to be a </div><div class="t m2e8 x41 hb y51c ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Christian. He expected her to rejoice with him, but instead, she </div><div class="t m80 x41 hb y9d3 ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">became angry. &quot;I&apos;ll not be a Christian! You must choose,&quot; she de-</div><div class="t m5c5 x41 hb y9d4 ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">manded. &quot;It is me or God.&quot; Igor chose God. </div><div class="t m328 x49 hb y9d5 ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Living for God may make life better, but it does not make life </div><div class="t m263 x41 hb y34b ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">easier. His wife left him; the university refused to excuse him from </div><div class="t m3eb x41 hb y436 ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">classes on Saturday; and Igor refused to break the Sabbath, even if it </div><div class="t m692 x17 hb y9d6 ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">meant he would be expelled. He asked God to intervene, and rejoiced </div><div class="t m35c x17 hb y520 ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">when the university changed its position. </div><div class="t m7c x49 hb y9d7 ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Igor longs to share the joy of his new faith with others, and has </div><div class="t m693 x17 hb y9d8 ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">dedicated his life to missionary work.
