Fascinated by these new ideas, he began communicating </div><div class="t m1a8 x26 he y8ce ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">with spirits, hoping to find success and happiness. But all he found </div><div class="t m40a x26 he y52b ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was trouble with the police and threats from mafia thugs. </div><div class="t m354 x3f he y52c ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">One day Alec was talking with some friends when one of them </div><div class="t m345 x26 he y52d ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">threw out a challenge. &quot;Satan is stronger than God!&quot; </div><div class="t m656 x7a he y8f8 ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;I do not know God,&quot; Alec replied. &quot;But He must be stronger than </div><div class="t m572 x26 he y52e ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Satan.&quot; Alec&apos;s words planted a seed in the heart of his friend that sent </div><div class="t m6c2 x26 he y8f9 ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">him searching for God.

Soon Alec too was convinced that the Bible was </div><div class="t m653 x27 he y533 ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">God&apos;s holy Book. The two attended every meeting, studying and </div><div class="t me9 x27 he y6a4 ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">learning. Alec accepted Jesus as his Lord. His heart overflowed </div><div class="t m6c0 x27 he y535 ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">with God&apos;s love, and he yearned to share it with others.

Eagerly he </div><div class="t m1ac x27 he y2a0 ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">put his poems to music and sang them whenever he had the chance. </div><div class="t m1e1 x27 he y8fc ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Alec has become a singing evangelist, and many have told him, &quot;I </div><div class="t m5b x27 he y2a2 ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">found Christ through your music.&quot; </div><div class="t m38c x1f he y62a ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Alec has found his spiritual gift. &quot;I want to be a musical mis-</div><div class="t m6c3 x27 he y5ed ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sionary for God,&quot; he says.
