A </div><div class="t m3e x3d h20 y255 ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">fellow prisoner, sensing Habib&apos;s desperation, secretly offered him </div><div class="t m3b8 x3d h20 y6db ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">a copy of a holy Book. It was the New Testament. Habib had </div><div class="t m676 x3d h20 y6dc ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">always considered the Koran to be the most holy book, and he </div><div class="t m54a x3d h20 y79c ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">wondered whether he should read this Christian Book. But, in his </div><div class="t m240 xb h20 y6dd ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">loneliness and despair, he began to read. The Bible brought him </div><div class="t m448 xb h20 y79d ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">peace and hope. </div><div class="t m4d2 x18 h20 y6df ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">When Habib was transferred to another prison, he had to leave </div><div class="t m537 xb h20 y79e ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the Bible behind.

In his country listening to Christian </div><div class="t m1c4 xb h20 y7a5 ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">radio can be dangerous, but Habib began to listen regularly. Soon </div><div class="t m218 xb h20 y7a6 ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">he found the same peace and hope that he had experienced while </div><div class="t m4af xb h20 yb4 ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">reading the Bible. </div><div class="t m1f7 x18 h20 y7a7 ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">He took another risk and wrote to AWR thanking the producers </div><div class="t m3e6 xb h20 y7a8 ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">for the programs and for helping him learn about Christ. &quot;How </div><div class="t m679 xb h20 y7a9 ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">attractive these subjects are!&quot; he exclaimed. &quot;You encourage us to </div><div class="t m13d xb h20 y7aa ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">have hope and trust in God.
