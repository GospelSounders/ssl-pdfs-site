God </div><div class="t m3a4 xd he y3ba ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">had opened unexpected doors to provide for his travel and the </div><div class="t mf1 xd he y3bb ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">campaign costs.

In spite of church members&apos; doubts about the success of the </div><div class="t mf9 x60 he y3c8 ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">meetings, they caught the vision and rallied behind the evangelist. </div><div class="t m3a9 x60 he y3c9 ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">They pooled their meager funds and rented the largest tent they </div><div class="t m2bd x60 he y3ca ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">could find; they prepared notices and sent out invitations to the </div><div class="t m296 x60 he y3cb ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">meetings; they invited their friends and relatives. And they prayed </div><div class="t m275 x60 he y3cc ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">for big results. </div><div class="t m13c x36 he y3cd ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">God honored their faith, and the tent was filled with some five </div><div class="t m2b4 x60 he y3ce ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">hundred people, two-thirds of whom were not Adventists. Among </div><div class="t m3aa x60 he y3cf ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the visitors was Fanwar&apos;s brother, Ulstar. After the meeting Ulstar </div><div class="t m275 x60 he y3d0 ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">spoke to his brother. &quot;You know that I did not get the ordination.&quot; </div><div class="t m3ab x36 he y3d1 ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Fanwar nodded. &quot;I prayed that God would stop the ordination and </div><div class="t m3ac x60 he y3d2 ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">call you back to His true church.&quot; As the brothers talked, Fanwar told </div><div class="t m3ad x60 he y3d3 ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">his brother, &quot;I asked God for 100 souls in this crusade.

Following the meetings, 88 people were bap-</div><div class="t m18e x59 he y3d9 ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tized in a river near the church, and others continue studying.
