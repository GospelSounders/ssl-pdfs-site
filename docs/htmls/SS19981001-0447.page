While </div><div class="t m4b7 xe he y52c ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">on a training mission thousands of feet above the ground, he </div><div class="t m2c0 xe he y52d ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">moved toward the plane&apos;s door, ready to jump when his com-</div><div class="t m4b8 xe he y52e ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">mander gave the signal. When he saw the signal to jump, he </div><div class="t m46e xe he y52f ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">pushed himself away from the plane and yanked on his parachute </div><div class="t m2e0 xe he y449 ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">cord. But another paratrooper had jumped at nearly the same in-</div><div class="t m395 xe he y530 ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">stant. Both men&apos;s parachutes opened at the same time. The chutes </div><div class="t m202 xe he y44b ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">became entangled and failed to open completely. </div><div class="t m12c x34 he y531 ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The two men desperately struggled to separate their parachutes </div><div class="t m26a xe he y44d ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">as they plummeted toward earth. In an instant Mark sensed that he </div><div class="t m4b9 xe he y532 ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was facing death and he was not prepared. He had no idea what lay </div><div class="t m4ba xe he y44f ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">beyond the grave. After what seemed like an eternity, the men </div><div class="t m2f1 xe he y533 ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">were able to separate their parachutes. They opened their emer-</div><div class="t m31a xe he y451 ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">gency chutes in time to slow their plunge to earth and allow for a </div><div class="t m34b xe he y534 ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">safe landing. </div><div class="t m4bb x34 he y452 ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Dazed, but without any broken bones, Mark could not shake the </div><div class="t m4ad xe he y535 ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">thought that he had just faced death.
