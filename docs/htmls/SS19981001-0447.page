While </div><div class="t m4b7 xd hc y52b ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">on a training mission thousands of feet above the ground, he </div><div class="t m2c0 xd hc y52c ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">moved toward the plane&apos;s door, ready to jump when his com-</div><div class="t m4b8 xd hc y52d ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">mander gave the signal. When he saw the signal to jump, he </div><div class="t m46e xd hc y52e ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">pushed himself away from the plane and yanked on his parachute </div><div class="t m2e0 xd hc y448 ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">cord.
