My partner </div><div class="t m4 x6e h12 y1f9 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">had gone to Mountain View College for our monthly report, leaving </div><div class="t m226 x6e h12 y1fa ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">me alone in the village. I planned to use her absence to get to know my </div><div class="t m227 x6e h12 y1fb ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">students and work on learning the language. </div><div class="t m228 x2 h12 y1fc ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">But my partner did not return when she planned. A week passed, and </div><div class="t m229 x6e h12 y1fd ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">still she had not returned. Then I learned that she had to go home to care </div><div class="t m9d x6e h12 y1fe ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">for her seriously ill mother. I was on my own. The Manobo children </div><div class="t m92 x6e h12 y1df ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">comforted me and helped me cope. After class I visited homes in the </div><div class="t m22a x6e h12 y1be ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">village. At one little home I found a young mother crying. </div><div class="t m22b x2 h12 y1ff ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;What is wrong, Ayo?&quot; I asked. Then I heard her baby&apos;s gasping </div><div class="t m22c x6e h12 y200 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">breath. He was congested with thick phlegm and could barely breathe. </div><div class="t m22d x2 h12 y201 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I checked his temperature; it was dangerously high. I had no medi-</div><div class="t m22e x6e h12 y202 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">cines, but I sponged him to bring his fever down, but it remained high. </div><div class="t m22f x6e h12 y203 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Ayo,&quot; I said, &quot;Let us ask God to heal your baby.&quot; She consented. </div><div class="t m230 x2 h12 y204 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Dear God,&quot; I prayed, &quot;You are the Great Physician. We need Your </div><div class="t m231 x6e h12 y205 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">presence and Your help. Please touch this baby with Your healing and </div><div class="t m232 x6e h12 y1e4 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">make him well again. In Jesus&apos; name, Amen.&quot; </div><div class="t ma7 x2 h12 y1c6 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Thank you,&quot; Ayo said. </div><div class="t m233 x2 h12 y206 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The baby&apos;s breathing did not improve. Desperate, I told Ayo, &quot;We </div><div class="t m234 xe h12 y207 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">must take the baby to the hospital.&quot; </div><div class="t m235 x2 h12 y208 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Ayo looked at me, puzzled. &quot;But why? We&apos;ve prayed, haven&apos;t we? </div><div class="t m236 xe h12 y209 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">We need only to trust in God, and my baby will be well.&quot; </div><div class="t m237 x2 h12 y20a ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;But Ayo, I am not a doctor, and your baby is so sick!&quot; I pleaded. </div><div class="t m238 x2 h12 y20b ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Ayo looked straight at me. &quot;Town is a three-hour hike down a steep </div><div class="t m239 xe h12 y1e8 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">mountain and across many rivers. Then we must ride two more hours </div><div class="t m1e2 xe h12 y20c ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">on the rough road to the nearest hospital. My baby might die on the </div><div class="t m23a xe h12 y20d ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">way. And when we get to the hospital, the doctor will charge us much </div><div class="t m23b xe h12 y20e ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">money for medicine. Do you have money?&quot; I shook my head No. &quot;It is </div><div class="t m19b xe h12 y20f ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">enough that we prayed. God will heal my baby,&quot; she smiled confi-</div><div class="t m23c xe h12 y210 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">dently. </div><div class="t m23d x2 h12 y211 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I stayed with Ayo and her baby a while longer. Before leaving, I </div><div class="t m233 xe h12 y212 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">offered another prayer. </div><div class="t m6a x2 h12 y213 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The next morning I hurried to check on Ayo&apos;s baby. &quot;He&apos;s well!&quot; </div><div class="t m23e xe h12 y214 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Ayo greeted me with a smile. I took the baby&apos;s temperature. The fever </div><div class="t m23f xe h12 y110 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was gone. </div><div class="t m1d7 x65 h12 y215 ff4 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">He was well! </div><div class="t m240 x2 h12 y216 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Choked with tears, I offered a Thank-You prayer. Then silently I </div><div class="t m241 xe h12 y217 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">added, </div><div class="t m1bc x7c h12 y217 ff4 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Lord, please help me to have faith like Ayo. </div><div class="t m242 x7d h11 y218 ff3 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Melchie Tonog is a SULAD student missionary from Mountain </div><div class="t m243 x68 h12 y219 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">View College serving in the village of Dapilo-an </div><div class="t m19b x70 h11 y21a ff3 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in southern </div><div class="t m1b3 x68 h12 y21b ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Philippines. </div><div class="t m244 x46 h3b y21c ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Produced by the Office of Mission </div><div class="t m245 x7 h3b y21d ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Sabbath School-Personal Ministries department of the General Conference </div><div class="t m246 x7e h3b y21e ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Email: gomission@gc.adventist.org </div><div class="t m3b x1f h3b y21f ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">î˜‰</div><div class="t m247 x7f h12 y220 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">13 </div></div><div class="pi" data-data='{"ctm":[1.000000,0.000000,0.000000,1.000000,0.000000,0.000000]}'></div></div>
