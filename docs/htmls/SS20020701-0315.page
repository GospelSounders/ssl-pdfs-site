My partner </div><div class="t m4 x6d h10 y1f8 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">had gone to Mountain View College for our monthly report, leaving </div><div class="t m226 x6d h10 y1f9 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">me alone in the village. I planned to use her absence to get to know my </div><div class="t m227 x6d h10 y1fa ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">students and work on learning the language. </div><div class="t m228 x1 h10 y1fb ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">But my partner did not return when she planned. A week passed, and </div><div class="t m229 x6d h10 y1fc ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">still she had not returned. Then I learned that she had to go home to care </div><div class="t m9d x6d h10 y1fd ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">for her seriously ill mother. I was on my own. The Manobo children </div><div class="t m92 x6d h10 y1de ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">comforted me and helped me cope. After class I visited homes in the </div><div class="t m22a x6d h10 y1bd ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">village. At one little home I found a young mother crying. </div><div class="t m22b x1 h10 y1fe ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;What is wrong, Ayo?&quot; I asked. Then I heard her baby&apos;s gasping </div><div class="t m22c x6d h10 y1ff ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">breath. He was congested with thick phlegm and could barely breathe. </div><div class="t m22d x1 h10 y200 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I checked his temperature; it was dangerously high. I had no medi-</div><div class="t m22e x6d h10 y201 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">cines, but I sponged him to bring his fever down, but it remained high. </div><div class="t m22f x6d h10 y202 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Ayo,&quot; I said, &quot;Let us ask God to heal your baby.&quot; She consented. </div><div class="t m230 x1 h10 y203 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Dear God,&quot; I prayed, &quot;You are the Great Physician. We need Your </div><div class="t m231 x6d h10 y204 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">presence and Your help. Please touch this baby with Your healing and </div><div class="t m232 x6d h10 y1e3 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">make him well again. In Jesus&apos; name, Amen.&quot; </div><div class="t ma7 x1 h10 y1c5 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Thank you,&quot; Ayo said. </div><div class="t m233 x1 h10 y205 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The baby&apos;s breathing did not improve. Desperate, I told Ayo, &quot;We </div><div class="t m234 xd h10 y206 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">must take the baby to the hospital.&quot; </div><div class="t m235 x1 h10 y207 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Ayo looked at me, puzzled. &quot;But why? We&apos;ve prayed, haven&apos;t we? </div><div class="t m236 xd h10 y208 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">We need only to trust in God, and my baby will be well.&quot; </div><div class="t m237 x1 h10 y209 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;But Ayo, I am not a doctor, and your baby is so sick!&quot; I pleaded. </div><div class="t m238 x1 h10 y20a ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Ayo looked straight at me. &quot;Town is a three-hour hike down a steep </div><div class="t m239 xd h10 y1e7 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">mountain and across many rivers. Then we must ride two more hours </div><div class="t m1e2 xd h10 y20b ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">on the rough road to the nearest hospital. My baby might die on the </div><div class="t m23a xd h10 y20c ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">way. And when we get to the hospital, the doctor will charge us much </div><div class="t m23b xd h10 y20d ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">money for medicine. Do you have money?&quot; I shook my head No. &quot;It is </div><div class="t m19b xd h10 y20e ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">enough that we prayed. God will heal my baby,&quot; she smiled confi-</div><div class="t m23c xd h10 y20f ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">dently. </div><div class="t m23d x1 h10 y210 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I stayed with Ayo and her baby a while longer. Before leaving, I </div><div class="t m233 xd h10 y211 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">offered another prayer. </div><div class="t m6a x1 h10 y212 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The next morning I hurried to check on Ayo&apos;s baby. &quot;He&apos;s well!&quot; </div><div class="t m23e xd h10 y213 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Ayo greeted me with a smile.
