The Old Tes-</div><div class="t m80 x20 h15 y74 ff4 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tament mentions women only a fraction of the time that it mentions </div><div class="t m81 x4 h15 y75 ff4 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">men. Three books—Obadiah, Habakkuk, and Haggai—do not refer </div><div class="t m82 x20 h15 y76 ff4 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to women at all. The names of 32 men are found in the title of Bible </div><div class="t m83 x4 h15 y77 ff4 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">books, whereas just two women have been given that honor. </div><div class="t m84 x21 h15 y78 ff4 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">But the Bible is not concerned with percentages of representation. </div><div class="t m85 x4 h15 y79 ff4 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Nor is it concerned with depicting a male-dominated world. Consid-</div><div class="t m86 x4 h15 y7a ff4 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ering women&apos;s position in society during Bible times, women were </div><div class="t m87 x4 h15 y7b ff4 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">well represented. The principles that their stories teach have great </div><div class="t m88 x4 h15 y7c ff4 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">value for us today. The Bible presents the stories of people—men, </div><div class="t m89 x4 h15 y7d ff4 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">women, and children—who respond positively to, or reject, God&apos;s </div><div class="t m8a x4 h15 y7e ff4 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">leading. The Scriptures tell the stories of those who accept or spurn </div><div class="t m8b x4 h15 y7f ff4 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the divine call to lead godlike lives under all conditions and circum-</div><div class="t m73 x4 h15 y80 ff4 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">stances. To dwell on the fact that Bible times may have been male- or </div><div class="t m8c x4 h15 y81 ff4 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">adult-oriented is to miss the point. God looks for people who will </div><div class="t m8d x4 h15 y82 ff4 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">live for Him and depict His love through concrete action wherever </div><div class="t m8e x4 h15 y83 ff4 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">they are, whatever the time and situation. </div><div class="t m8f x21 h15 y84 ff4 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">During this quarter we will study the books of Ruth and Esther. </div><div class="t m90 x4 h15 y85 ff4 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Their main characters include several women. But they present more </div><div class="t m91 x4 h15 y86 ff4 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">than just stories about women—they present stories of women, and </div><div class="t m92 x4 h15 y87 ff4 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">also men, who lived for God despite difficult and trying circum-</div><div class="t m93 x4 h15 y88 ff4 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">stances. These women and men represented Him and His love in a </div><div class="t m94 x34 h15 y89 ff4 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">world of tragedy, injustice, and danger. </div><div class="t m95 x18 h15 y8a ff4 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Naomi struggled with the question of why God seemingly allowed </div><div class="t m96 x34 h15 y8b ff4 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the tragedy of death to sweep her family away. Esther lived in a time </div><div class="t m97 x34 h15 y8c ff4 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">when the very existence of God&apos;s people seemed to be at stake. In </div><div class="t m98 x34 h15 y8d ff4 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">both books, we see men and women meeting life in ways that reveal </div><div class="t m99 x34 h15 y8e ff4 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to us how to be godly during emergencies and in everyday duties. </div><div class="t m9a x34 h15 y8f ff4 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Many of the people we will meet were God&apos;s people who responded </div><div class="t m9b x34 h15 y90 ff4 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to His leading wherever they were, no matter how difficult the situa-</div><div class="t m9c x34 h15 y91 ff4 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tion. </div></div><div class="pi" data-data='{"ctm":[1.000000,0.000000,0.000000,1.000000,0.000000,0.000000]}'></div></div>
