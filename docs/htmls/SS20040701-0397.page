He joined a Catholic youth </div><div class="t m2c7 xf h8 y82f ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">group in high school and eventually began assisting the priest at Mass. The </div><div class="t m4bd xf h8 y830 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">priest noticed his faithful work and urged Jeofelo to consider studying to </div><div class="t m3bd xf h8 y3d1 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">become a priest. Jeofelo took a test to qualify to study for the priesthood, </div><div class="t m3f3 xf h8 y295 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and he passed. He enrolled in a program to prepare him to study theology </div><div class="t m2be xf h8 y831 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">at a university. </div><div class="t m404 x4c h8 y298 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Jeofelo&apos;s parents were as proud as he was when at last he was ordained </div><div class="t m4ac xf h8 y833 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">as a priest.
