He joined a Catholic youth </div><div class="t m2c7 xe h6 y82e ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">group in high school and eventually began assisting the priest at Mass. The </div><div class="t m4bd xe h6 y82f ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">priest noticed his faithful work and urged Jeofelo to consider studying to </div><div class="t m3bd xe h6 y3d0 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">become a priest. Jeofelo took a test to qualify to study for the priesthood, </div><div class="t m3f3 xe h6 y294 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and he passed. He enrolled in a program to prepare him to study theology </div><div class="t m2be xe h6 y830 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">at a university. </div><div class="t m404 x4b h6 y297 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Jeofelo&apos;s parents were as proud as he was when at last he was ordained </div><div class="t m4ac xe h6 y832 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">as a priest. Jeofelo liked his new title, Reverend Father. He served as priest </div><div class="t m19 xe h6 y8e8 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in several congregations. </div><div class="t m109 x4b h6 y8e9 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">One day he went to the optometrist for new glasses.

Jeofelo was impressed with her professionalism </div><div class="t m655 xe h6 y7c8 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and kindness and decided to get to know her better. He learned that she </div><div class="t m632 xe h6 y3d6 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was a Seventh-day Adventist. </div><div class="t m154 x4b h6 y8eb ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Joefelo resigned his position and joined a denomination in which he </div><div class="t m503 x1 h6 y833 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">could marry and still serve as a Reverend Father. </div><div class="t m20e x4b h6 y834 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Jeofelo dated the young optometrist and soon proposed marriage.

She agreed. </div><div class="t m6a8 x4b h6 y29a ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">One day while riding his motorcycle, Jeofelo was seriously injured in an </div><div class="t m6a9 x1 h6 y29b ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">accident. He spent weeks in the hospital and two months at home in a </div><div class="t mb5 x1 h6 y29c ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">wheelchair.

Jeofelo felt that God was trying to get his attention. He opened </div><div class="t m145 x1 h6 y8f0 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">his Bible and read Matthew 16:26, &quot;For what profit is it to a man if he </div><div class="t m304 x1 h6 y8f1 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">gains the whole world, and loses his own soul?
