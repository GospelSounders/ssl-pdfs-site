All who choose to breathe this life-giving </div><div class="t m1ec xc h21 y588 ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">atmosphere will live and grow up to the stature of men and women in </div><div class="t m432 xc h21 y265 ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Christ </div><div class="t m4b9 x27 h21 y4d1 ff7 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Jesus.&quot;—Steps to Christ, </div><div class="t m1dd xd h21 y4d1 ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">p. 68. </div><div class="t m283 x28 h21 y589 ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Without exception Paul expresses in all of his epistles the wish that the </div><div class="t m4ba xc h21 y215 ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">grace of God be with his readers. He presents this thought in different </div><div class="t m131 xc h21 yba ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">words, sometimes briefly, sometimes in a more extended fashion. It is his </div><div class="t m4bb xc h21 y58a ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">way of saying &quot;God be with you.&quot; In its extended form it is the well-</div><div class="t m4bc xc h21 y217 ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">known grace employed as a benediction (2 Cor. 13:14). To the Roman </div><div class="t m4bd xc h21 y4b2 ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">church he repeats the blessing (Rom. 16:20, 24); and to the Colossians </div><div class="t m4be xc h21 y4d7 ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and in both epistles to Timothy the shortest benediction is found: &quot;Grace </div><div class="t m3e1 xc h21 y219 ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">be with you&quot; (1 Tim. 6:21; 2 Tim. 4:22, NKJV). </div><div class="t m3f0 x28 h21 y21a ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">What better termination could there be to an epistle which begins with </div><div class="t m4bf xc h21 y4db ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Grace, mercy, and peace, from God the Father and Christ Jesus our </div><div class="t m271 xc h21 y4dc ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Lord&quot; (2 Tim. 1:2)? Paul not only ends his epistles with benedictions of </div><div class="t m2b2 x5d h21 y21b ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">grace, but he also opens them with the same greeting, allying grace with </div><div class="t m3a4 xc h21 y4dd ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">peace always, and sometimes with mercy. And in between the opening </div><div class="t m121 xc h21 y4df ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and closing statements are messages full of grace and its marvelous riches </div><div class="t m5d xc h21 yc5 ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and power in transforming lives. </div><div class="t m4c0 x6 h21 y58b ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">As it happened, his final benediction—&quot;Grace be with you. Amen. &quot;—</div><div class="t m3c7 xc h21 y58c ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was his final good-bye to Timothy, to his other fellow workers, and to the </div><div class="t m4c1 xc h21 y58d ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">world. But it was good-bye until he would meet them again in glory at the </div><div class="t m13a xc h21 y2a0 ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">coming of his Lord. </div><div class="t m4a3 x6 h22 y4e5 ff6 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">How much grace is available to all? James 4:5-8. </div><div class="t m263 x6 h21 y4e7 ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The grace of God is available to all, but it is &quot;given&quot; to those who are </div><div class="t m2e4 x5d h21 y4c3 ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">friends of God, although this is not a once-for-all gift. Resisting the devil </div><div class="t m38 x5d h21 y58e ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and submitting to God (verse 7) is a work that requires grace added to </div><div class="t m356 x5d h21 y58f ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">grace. This suggests that there is an illimitable supply from which we can </div><div class="t m1a x5d h21 y590 ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">obtain sufficient for our needs. The apostle Paul himself was afflicted by </div><div class="t m3b3 x5d h21 y591 ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet&quot; him (2 Cor. 12:7). </div><div class="t mec x4 h21 y592 ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Three times he asked the Lord to remove it, but he received this answer: </div><div class="t m264 x4 h21 y593 ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;My grace is sufficient for thee&quot; (verse 9). The obstacle, therefore, was </div><div class="t m4c2 x5d h21 y405 ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">not of such besetting power that the grace of God could not overcome it </div><div class="t m4c3 x4 h21 y13 ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in his life. From this intimate experience he counseled Timothy to &quot;be </div><div class="t m4c4 x4 h21 y4ec ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus&quot; (2 Tim. 2:1). To be strong in </div><div class="t mea x4 h21 y594 ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">certain characteristics is to possess them in large measure, to be expert in </div><div class="t m4c5 x4 h21 y595 ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">a certain talent, to excel at certain abilities. To &quot;be strong in the grace&quot; </div><div class="t m4c6 x4 h21 y596 ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">means to be capable of using grace in a large way, to fight successfully the </div><div class="t m1f1 x4 h21 y597 ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">battles of the Lord, and to defeat Satan by the unending supplies of grace </div><div class="t m419 x4 h21 y598 ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">from the Lord Jesus Christ. </div><div class="t m400 x50 h21 y599 ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Paul was &quot;strong in the grace.&quot; His faith &quot;made strong by effort and </div><div class="t m4c7 x5d h21 y59a ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">pure by sacrifice, upheld and strengthened </div><div class="t m4c8 xae h21 y155 ff7 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">him.&quot;—Gospel Workers, </div><div class="t m406 x24 h21 y59b ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">p. </div><div class="t mce x4 h21 y3e3 ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">108.
