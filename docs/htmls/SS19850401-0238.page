He presents this thought in different </div><div class="t m131 xd h25 ybb ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">words, sometimes briefly, sometimes in a more extended fashion. It is his </div><div class="t m4bb xd h25 y58b ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">way of saying &quot;God be with you.&quot; In its extended form it is the well-</div><div class="t m4bc xd h25 y218 ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">known grace employed as a benediction (2 Cor. 13:14). To the Roman </div><div class="t m4bd xd h25 y4b3 ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">church he repeats the blessing (Rom. 16:20, 24); and to the Colossians </div><div class="t m4be xd h25 y4d8 ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and in both epistles to Timothy the shortest benediction is found: &quot;Grace </div><div class="t m3e1 xd h25 y21a ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">be with you&quot; (1 Tim. 6:21; 2 Tim. 4:22, NKJV). </div><div class="t m3f0 x29 h25 y21b ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">What better termination could there be to an epistle which begins with </div><div class="t m4bf xd h25 y4dc ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Grace, mercy, and peace, from God the Father and Christ Jesus our </div><div class="t m271 xd h25 y4dd ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Lord&quot; (2 Tim. 1:2)? Paul not only ends his epistles with benedictions of </div><div class="t m2b2 x5d h25 y21c ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">grace, but he also opens them with the same greeting, allying grace with </div><div class="t m3a4 xd h25 y4de ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">peace always, and sometimes with mercy. And in between the opening </div><div class="t m121 xd h25 y4e0 ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and closing statements are messages full of grace and its marvelous riches </div><div class="t m5d xd h25 yc6 ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and power in transforming lives. </div><div class="t m4c0 x7 h25 y58c ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">As it happened, his final benediction—&quot;Grace be with you. Amen. &quot;—</div><div class="t m3c7 xd h25 y58d ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was his final good-bye to Timothy, to his other fellow workers, and to the </div><div class="t m4c1 xd h25 y58e ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">world. But it was good-bye until he would meet them again in glory at the </div><div class="t m13a xd h25 y2a1 ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">coming of his Lord. </div><div class="t m4a3 x7 h26 y4e6 ff6 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">How much grace is available to all? James 4:5-8. </div><div class="t m263 x7 h25 y4e8 ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The grace of God is available to all, but it is &quot;given&quot; to those who are </div><div class="t m2e4 x5d h25 y4c4 ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">friends of God, although this is not a once-for-all gift. Resisting the devil </div><div class="t m38 x5d h25 y58f ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and submitting to God (verse 7) is a work that requires grace added to </div><div class="t m356 x5d h25 y590 ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">grace. This suggests that there is an illimitable supply from which we can </div><div class="t m1a x5d h25 y591 ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">obtain sufficient for our needs. The apostle Paul himself was afflicted by </div><div class="t m3b3 x5d h25 y592 ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet&quot; him (2 Cor. 12:7). </div><div class="t mec x5 h25 y593 ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Three times he asked the Lord to remove it, but he received this answer: </div><div class="t m264 x5 h25 y594 ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;My grace is sufficient for thee&quot; (verse 9). The obstacle, therefore, was </div><div class="t m4c2 x5d h25 y406 ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">not of such besetting power that the grace of God could not overcome it </div><div class="t m4c3 x5 h25 y14 ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in his life. From this intimate experience he counseled Timothy to &quot;be </div><div class="t m4c4 x5 h25 y4ed ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus&quot; (2 Tim. 2:1). To be strong in </div><div class="t mea x5 h25 y595 ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">certain characteristics is to possess them in large measure, to be expert in </div><div class="t m4c5 x5 h25 y596 ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">a certain talent, to excel at certain abilities. To &quot;be strong in the grace&quot; </div><div class="t m4c6 x5 h25 y597 ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">means to be capable of using grace in a large way, to fight successfully the </div><div class="t m1f1 x5 h25 y598 ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">battles of the Lord, and to defeat Satan by the unending supplies of grace </div><div class="t m419 x5 h25 y599 ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">from the Lord Jesus Christ. </div><div class="t m400 x50 h25 y59a ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Paul was &quot;strong in the grace.&quot; His faith &quot;made strong by effort and </div><div class="t m4c7 x5d h25 y59b ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">pure by sacrifice, upheld and strengthened </div><div class="t m4c8 xae h25 y156 ff7 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">him.&quot;—Gospel Workers, </div><div class="t m406 x25 h25 y59c ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">p. </div><div class="t mce x5 h25 y3e4 ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">108.
