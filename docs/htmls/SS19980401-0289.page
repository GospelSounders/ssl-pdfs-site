Sumathi visited these women. She told them </div><div class="t m498 x27 hc y859 ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">about Jesus, who once transformed a woman caught in adultery—</div><div class="t m1df x27 hc y85a ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">very much like some of them—from a broken piece of humanity </div><div class="t m371 x27 hc y85b ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">into a loving disciple.
