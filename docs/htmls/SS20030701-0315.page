She </div><div class="t ma1 x4b h30 y1f5 ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">smelled the burning incense used to call the spirits. She watched her </div><div class="t m1e8 x4b h30 y1f6 ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">parents hold midnight seances, tell the future, or burn candles to make </div><div class="t m71 x4b h30 y45 ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">one person love another or to make someone sick and die. As she </div><div class="t m1e9 x4b h30 y1f7 ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">grew older, her parents urged her to practice witchcraft. </div><div class="t m1ea x38 h30 y1f8 ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">When she was 18, she moved in with a man. But after five years of </div><div class="t m3b x4b h30 y1f9 ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">abuse, she left him and threw herself into her witchcraft and communi-</div><div class="t m1eb x4b h30 y1fa ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">cating with the devil. Several years later, after more failed relationships, </div><div class="t m158 x4b h30 y1fb ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">she had an encounter that changed her life, an encounter with Jesus. </div><div class="t m1d3 x38 h30 y1fc ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">She was alone when she sensed a presence in the room. It was none </div><div class="t m1ec x76 h30 y1fd ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of the spirits who normally came to her. This spirit was different—</div><div class="t m1ed x76 h30 y1fe ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">peaceful, powerful, and full of love. She sensed that it was Jesus, and </div><div class="t m1ee x76 h30 y1ff ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">she cried out to Him. With all her heart she wanted to surrender to Him. </div><div class="t m1ef x38 h30 y200 ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Then the Spirit spoke to her. &quot;Give up your witchcraft; give up </div><div class="t m1f0 x76 h30 y201 ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">your drinking and your adultery. Destroy your witchcraft books, </div><div class="t m1f1 x76 h30 y202 ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">dolls, and potions, and follow Me. Be a light to the people that you </div><div class="t m1cb x76 h30 y203 ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">meet.&quot; Suddenly she knew: she was no more Yolanda the witch; she </div><div class="t m1f2 x76 h30 y204 ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was Yolanda, the child of God. </div><div class="t m1f3 x38 h30 y205 ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Yolanda obeyed God&apos;s voice. But God had not told her which church </div><div class="t m1f4 x76 h30 y206 ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to attend. She visited several churches, but none of them satisfied her. </div><div class="t m1f5 x38 h30 y207 ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">One day a man knocked on her door and told her, &quot;God sent me to give </div><div class="t m1f6 xf h30 y208 ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">you a Bible study.&quot; The night before she had asked God to show her </div><div class="t m1f7 x76 h30 y209 ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">which church to attend.
