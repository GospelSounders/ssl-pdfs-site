H. Zachary </div><div class="t m5bc x4b hf y6e9 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">RUSSIA—Natasha Dashidordzieva comes from a Buddhist back-</div><div class="t m409 x12 hf y6ea ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ground. But growing up in Russia, she was taught to trust in atheistic </div><div class="t m5bd x12 hf y6eb ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">communism. She tried to start several businesses, but each time her </div><div class="t m5be x12 hf y6ec ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">efforts resulted in failure. </div><div class="t ma2 x4b hf y6ed ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Discouraged, Natasha began searching for God. She read many </div><div class="t m5bf x12 hf y6ee ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">books, visited religious teachers, and endured many strange practices </div><div class="t m5c0 x12 hf y6ef ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in an attempt to find God. Finally, she gave up in frustration. </div><div class="t m5c1 x1e hf y6f0 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">A neighbor gave her some religious books, but Natasha decided to </div><div class="t m2e6 x12 hf y6f1 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">return them unread. She knocked on the neighbor&apos;s door and found </div><div class="t m5c2 x12 hf y6f2 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">several women holding a Bible fellowship. The neighbor invited her to </div><div class="t m5c3 x12 hf y6f3 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">stay, and out of courtesy she did. But she was not interested in any new </div><div class="t m317 x12 hf y6f4 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">religious ideas. </div><div class="t m21f x4b hf y6f5 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">However, Natasha noticed that the women seemed happy. As the </div><div class="t m531 x12 hf y6f6 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">women shared ideas, Natasha suddenly blurted out, &quot;I don&apos;t believe </div><div class="t m5c4 x12 hf y6f7 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">there is a living God. If there is, why do I pray but receive no answers?&quot; </div><div class="t m5c5 x4b hf y6f8 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Natasha told them of her failed business attempts, and one woman </div><div class="t m5c6 x12 hf y582 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">suggested that she should try giving God a tithe of her income and see </div><div class="t m107 x12 hf y583 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">what happened. It sounded ridiculous to her, but finally Natasha </div><div class="t m60 x12 hf y6f9 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">decided to try it. She was amazed when her business efforts began to </div><div class="t m5c7 x41 hf y6fa ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">prosper. Natasha continued attending the fellowship group. </div><div class="t m5c8 x4b hf y6fb ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The women planned an outing in the country, and Natasha wanted </div><div class="t m5c9 x41 hf y6fc ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to go. But she had no money. A friend owed her some money and had </div><div class="t m21f x41 hf y653 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">not repaid it. Natasha prayed, &quot;Lord, if You really exist, please send </div><div class="t m47f x41 hf y6fd ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">my friend to repay the money she owes me—today.&quot; As the hours </div><div class="t m12c x41 hf y6fe ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">passed and her friend did not come, Natasha wondered if God had </div><div class="t m190 x41 hf y6ff ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">heard her prayer. Then at sunset her friend appeared with the money </div><div class="t m5ca x41 hf y700 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">she had borrowed. </div><div class="t m44 x46 hf y58b ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Natasha was convinced.
