We were called to a </div><div class="t m36f x16 h21 y444 ff3 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">district far from our friends and colleagues. After much prayer, we </div><div class="t m370 x16 h21 y445 ff3 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">accepted this new assignment. It was difficult for me to move to this </div><div class="t m371 x16 h21 y446 ff3 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">small village where I didn&apos;t know anyone, and had no work. </div><div class="t m1be x1a h21 y447 ff3 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I prayed for a ministry in my new village, and felt impressed to </div><div class="t m372 x16 h21 y448 ff3 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">begin a child-care center as an outreach in this small town. I could </div><div class="t m373 x16 h21 y449 ff3 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">meet adults by caring for their children. I hoped this would lead to </div><div class="t m18d x16 h21 y44a ff3 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Bible studies with some of them. I found a place to operate the </div><div class="t m51 x16 h21 y44b ff3 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">child care center, and the first day I registered 10 children. </div><div class="t m84 xd h21 y44c ff3 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Then trouble started. Caterpillars invaded the center. They </div><div class="t mc7 x16 h21 y44d ff3 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">came from everywhere. They secreted a poison that made the </div><div class="t m374 x16 h21 y44e ff3 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">children&apos;s skin break out in a rash. I couldn&apos;t keep the caterpillars </div><div class="t m375 x16 h21 y44f ff3 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">off the children. Because of them, some of the children dropped </div><div class="t m109 x16 h21 y450 ff3 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">out. </div><div class="t m376 x1a h21 y451 ff3 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Then mosquitoes swarmed us without mercy. The children </div><div class="t mff x10 h21 y452 ff3 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">were being eaten alive. The parents threatened to keep the chil-</div><div class="t m377 x16 h21 y453 ff3 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">dren home if the problem did not stop. I prayed. &quot;Lord, this is </div><div class="t m378 x10 h21 y454 ff3 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Your work. If it is Your will that I continue this child-care </div><div class="t m1b x16 h21 y455 ff3 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">program, please get rid of these mosquitoes.&quot; </div><div class="t m21c x1a h21 y5f ff3 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The next day I returned to the child-care center and stuck out </div><div class="t m55 x10 h21 y456 ff3 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">my arm to test for mosquitoes. I waited a minute—no mosquitoes. </div><div class="t m34e x10 h21 y457 ff3 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Five minutes. Ten minutes. Twenty minutes. Still no mosquitoes. </div><div class="t m71 x10 h21 y458 ff3 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">It was an answer to prayer! A few children came. At nap time, </div><div class="t m21 x10 h21 y459 ff3 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">they asked me why I didn&apos;t cover them with mosquito netting. </div><div class="t m379 x10 h21 y45a ff3 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;The mosquitoes are gone,&quot; I replied. Then I told them how I </div><div class="t m37a x10 h21 y45b ff3 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">prayed to my Jesus and He had taken the mosquitoes away. &quot;They </div><div class="t m37b x10 h21 y45c ff3 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">will not be back ever to bother us again.&quot; </div><div class="t m37c x1a h21 y45d ff3 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">That evening, the children told their parents. One mother could </div><div class="t m37d x10 h21 y1c ff3 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">not believe the mosquitoes were gone. I told her about my prayer. </div><div class="t m2a9 x10 h21 y45e ff3 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">She stayed all day to see if it was really true. Then she told the </div><div class="t m37e x10 h21 y45f ff3 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">entire village—no more mosquitoes! The next week 20 children </div><div class="t m37f x10 h21 y460 ff3 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">came to the child-care center. In a couple of weeks our numbers </div><div class="t m6a x10 h21 y461 ff3 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">grew to 40, then to 60. Many cried when I had no more room in </div><div class="t m380 x10 h21 y462 ff3 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the program. </div><div class="t m381 x2 h21 y463 ff3 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I can minister to these people because Jesus honored my prayer </div><div class="t m382 x52 h21 y464 ff3 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and my desire to serve Him.
