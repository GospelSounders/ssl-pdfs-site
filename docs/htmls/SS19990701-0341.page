However, the </div><div class="t m462 x54 h1d ye3 ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">chronological material in the Bible is not always easy to understand, </div><div class="t m6b x54 h1d y4f8 ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and scholars have not been able to agree on a single biblical chronol-</div><div class="t m463 x54 h1d y4f9 ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ogy.
