He </div><div class="t m1e x3c h10 y5d9 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">defeated the Syrians in two wars (1 Kings 20:1-34) that, appar-</div><div class="t m651 x68 h10 y8a6 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ently, left him well off economically. </div><div class="t m282 x77 hf y8a7 ff3 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Read the story of Ahab, Jezebel, and Naboth, at least as far as verse </div><div class="t m6cb x68 hf y75a ff3 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">16 in 1 Kings 21. According to </div><div class="t m4a7 x5f hf y5df ff5 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The SDA Bible Commentary, </div><div class="t m5e6 x6c hf y5df ff3 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Naboth </div><div class="t m3e x68 hf y8a8 ff3 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">apparently believed that it was &quot;against the spiritual purpose of the </div><div class="t m23a x68 hf y5e1 ff3 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Levitical law for him to transfer his inheritance to the king.&quot;—Vol. 2, </div><div class="t m320 x68 hf y8a9 ff3 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">p. 834:3, &quot;The Lord forbid it.&quot; Whether he understood the law </div><div class="t m106 x68 hf y8aa ff3 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">correctly or not, Naboth was determined not to give his land to the </div><div class="t m4b7 x68 hf y8ab ff3 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">king. Obviously, he felt a responsibility to a higher authority. In </div><div class="t m1fb x68 hf y8ac ff3 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the context of this story, answer the following questions: </div><div class="t m6cc x77 hf y8ad ff3 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">What did Ahab offer Naboth for the vineyard? Was it a fair </div><div class="t m1b1 x68 hf y8ae ff3 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">price? Read 1 Kings 21:9 and 10, which record Jezebel&apos;s plot. </div><div class="t m6b3 x68 hf y8af ff3 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Notice the irony.

Or did Jezebel have other motives? If so, what were they? </div><div class="t m471 x44 h10 y8b5 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Read the rest of the chapter. Notice the phrase Elijah uses when he </div><div class="t m44e x46 h10 y76f ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">confronts Ahab: &quot;&apos;Because you </div><div class="t m255 x8 h10 y8b6 ff4 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">have sold yourself </div><div class="t m13e x2a h10 y8b6 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to do evil in the </div><div class="t m2eb x46 h10 y8b7 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sight of the Lord&quot;&apos; (vs. 20, NKJV, emphasis supplied). It implies that </div><div class="t m1e3 x46 h10 y8b8 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">there was some good in the king, that he knew what was right, but he </div><div class="t m33a x46 h10 y8b9 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">allowed himself to sell his principles for a price.

Apparently, this </div><div class="t m256 x54 h10 y8be ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was not just for show.
