Obviously, he felt a responsibility to a higher authority. In </div><div class="t m1fb x69 h11 y8ad ff3 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the context of this story, answer the following questions: </div><div class="t m6cc x78 h11 y8ae ff3 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">What did Ahab offer Naboth for the vineyard? Was it a fair </div><div class="t m1b1 x69 h11 y8af ff3 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">price? Read 1 Kings 21:9 and 10, which record Jezebel&apos;s plot. </div><div class="t m6b3 x69 h11 y8b0 ff3 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Notice the irony.

Or did Jezebel have other motives? If so, what were they? </div><div class="t m471 x45 h12 y8b6 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Read the rest of the chapter. Notice the phrase Elijah uses when he </div><div class="t m44e x47 h12 y770 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">confronts Ahab: &quot;&apos;Because you </div><div class="t m255 x9 h12 y8b7 ff4 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">have sold yourself </div><div class="t m13e x2b h12 y8b7 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to do evil in the </div><div class="t m2eb x47 h12 y8b8 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sight of the Lord&quot;&apos; (vs. 20, NKJV, emphasis supplied). It implies that </div><div class="t m1e3 x47 h12 y8b9 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">there was some good in the king, that he knew what was right, but he </div><div class="t m33a x47 h12 y8ba ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">allowed himself to sell his principles for a price. Verse 25 repeats the </div><div class="t m6cd x55 h12 y8bb ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">same idea but adds the expression that he sold himself because &quot;Jezebel </div><div class="t m1bf x47 h12 y8bc ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">his wife stirred him up&quot; (NKJV). </div><div class="t m4d8 x6 h12 y8bd ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Perhaps all this helps explain what happens next.

Apparently, this </div><div class="t m256 x55 h12 y8bf ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was not just for show. He had truly repented, for the Lord told Elijah, </div><div class="t m6cf x55 h12 y8c0 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;See how Ahab has humbled himself before Me?
