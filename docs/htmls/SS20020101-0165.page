She lay helpless in bed as nurses </div><div class="t m186 x7a he y6a4 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tried desperately to find a vein and insert an IV. Alice, who had fought </div><div class="t m41 x7a he y6a5 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">God&apos;s convicting voice, finally gave in. &quot;OK, God,&quot; she said. &quot;I will </div><div class="t m5a7 x7a he y7b ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">keep the Sabbath!&quot; Just then the nurses located a vein and started the </div><div class="t m5a8 x7a he y7c ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">IV.

The more Alice tried to get </div><div class="t m5ae x7a he y3f8 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">him to stop drinking and straighten out his life, the more he resisted. </div><div class="t m224 x7a he y3f9 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Seeing that her plan was not working, Alice stopped nagging and </div><div class="t m5af x7a he y3cb ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">began praying for him.
