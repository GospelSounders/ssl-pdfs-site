There is </div><div class="t mb9 x1 h24 yb3 ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">only one true solution—to turn to our Creator and Redeemer so that we </div><div class="t mba x1 h24 yb4 ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">may discover what He is able to reveal to us about Himself and His </div><div class="t mbb x1 h24 yb5 ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">purposes for us.

The fullest revelation of God is found in </div><div class="t mc0 x1 h24 yb9 ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Jesus Christ, who is the focus of the Scriptures.
