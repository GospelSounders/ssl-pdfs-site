To believe something, it is maintained, is </div><div class="t m24d x71 h1e y26e ff5 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to accept it as true and factual. To believe someone is to accept what that </div><div class="t m105 x71 h1e y26f ff5 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">person says as correct. </div><div class="t m24e x70 h1e y270 ff5 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Even the devils are not atheists. &quot;Thou believest that there is one God; </div><div class="t m141 x71 h1e y271 ff5 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">thou doest well: the devils also believe, and tremble&quot; (James 2:19). The </div><div class="t m24f x71 h1e y272 ff5 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">devils believe in God&apos;s existence and in His power. They even believe in </div><div class="t m250 x71 h1e y273 ff5 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">His Word more readily than many Christians do—yet they tremble. </div><div class="t m251 x70 h1e y274 ff5 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">This belief brings them no peace. Instead it leaves them trembling in </div><div class="t m252 x71 h1e y275 ff5 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">fear. Why do the devils tremble? This week we will discover that the dev-</div><div class="t m253 x71 h1e y276 ff5 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ils tremble because their belief is not the true belief that John describes in </div><div class="t m254 x71 h1e y277 ff5 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">his Gospel. </div><div class="t m6a x47 h3 y278 ff1 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I. BELIEVING IS TRUSTING (John 14:1). </div><div class="t m255 x70 h1e y279 ff5 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">A toddler was placed on a high ledge by her father. He assured her that </div><div class="t m256 x71 h1e y27a ff5 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">he would catch her, then told her to jump. Without hesitating, she pushed </div><div class="t m1e0 x71 h1e y27b ff5 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">off from the ledge and plummeted into his arms. Far from being afraid, </div><div class="t m257 x71 h1e y27c ff5 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">she insisted that they do it again, and again, and again. </div><div class="t m258 x7d h1e y27d ff5 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The father was amazed and more than a little gratified by her total con-</div><div class="t m259 x44 h1e y27e ff5 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">fidence that he would catch her. Had he stepped aside as she leaped from </div><div class="t m25a x71 h1e y27f ff5 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the ledge, she surely would have been injured—perhaps seriously. But </div><div class="t m25b x44 h1e y280 ff5 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">she seemed not even to have considered that possibility. She trusted her </div><div class="t m25c x71 h1e y281 ff5 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">father implicitly. </div><div class="t m25d x70 h1e y282 ff5 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">As we reflect on the basis for such trust, we must conclude that it prob-</div><div class="t m25e x71 h1e y283 ff5 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ably was founded on two things. First, the daughter knew that her father </div><div class="t m25f x71 h1e y284 ff5 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was </div><div class="t m260 x1b h1e y284 ff6 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">able </div><div class="t m261 x50 h1e y285 ff5 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to catch her. He was strong enough to intercept her small body </div><div class="t m262 x71 h1e y286 ff5 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">easily as it hurtled toward the floor. Had she not, after all, seen him lift </div><div class="t m263 x71 h1e y287 ff5 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">heavy items of furniture? Had he not lifted her over his head so that she </div><div class="t m264 x71 h1e y288 ff5 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">could touch the ceiling? Was it not true that her daddy could do just about </div><div class="t m265 x71 h1e y289 ff5 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">anything? </div><div class="t m25d x70 h1e y28a ff5 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Second, she knew that her father loved her. She knew him well enough </div><div class="t mdc x71 h1e y28b ff5 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to know that he would not fail her. She knew that he cared about her too </div><div class="t m266 x71 h1e y28c ff5 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">much to permit her to be harmed if he could prevent it. She </div><div class="t m267 x7e h1e y28c ff6 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">believed </div><div class="t m268 x7f h1e y28d ff5 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in </div><div class="t m269 x71 h1e y28e ff5 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">him. Her belief extended far beyond a simple conviction that he basically </div><div class="t m26a x71 h1e y28f ff5 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was truthful and benevolent; her trust was so thoroughly without reserva-</div><div class="t mc x71 h1e y290 ff5 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tion that she could leap from a high place with no fear whatever. </div><div class="t m26b x47 h3 y291 ff1 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">THINK IT THROUGH: What does John help us understand about the </div><div class="t m26c x47 h3 y292 ff1 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">deeper meaning of </div><div class="t m9c x3a h1e y293 ff6 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">believe? </div><div class="t m116 x70 h1e y294 ff5 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">It means far more than just accepting the facts about Jesus. It means </div><div class="t m26d x71 h1e y295 ff5 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">more than agreeing that He is altogether powerful and full of love. To </div><div class="t m26e x71 h1e y296 ff5 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">believe in Jesus Christ is to trust His power and love so completely that </div><div class="t m259 x71 h1e y297 ff5 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">we are willing to let go of every other possible support and cast ourselves </div><div class="t m103 x71 h1e y298 ff5 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">totally upon Him. It is to abandon ourselves utterly to His goodness. It is </div><div class="t m26f x71 h1e y299 ff5 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to depend on Him absolutely and rely on Him perfectly. </div><div class="t m270 x70 h1e y29a ff5 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Belief does include acceptance of certain facts; but </div><div class="t m271 x59 h1e y29b ff6 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">saving </div><div class="t m272 x5f h1e y29c ff5 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">faith or be-</div><div class="t m273 x71 h1e y29d ff5 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">lief must go beyond intellectual assent and include an active, dependent </div><div class="t m274 x47 h1e y29e ff5 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">trust in a person.
