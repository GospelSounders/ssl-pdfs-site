He met strong opposition from others when he tried to share </div><div class="t m6c7 x30 hd y576 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">his faith, but eventually a few others were baptized. </div><div class="t m56e x64 hd y577 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The believers held evangelistic meetings, and seven people pre-</div><div class="t m6c8 x11 hd yce ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">pared for baptism. But an eight-month drought had left the nearby </div><div class="t m58b x11 hd ycf ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">river dry. Some skeptical villagers jeered at the Adventists, who </div><div class="t mf1 x11 hd y90e ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">insisted on baptizing by immersion, even when there was no water. </div><div class="t m273 x30 hd y57a ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The only alternative was to baptize the new believers in an oil drum. </div><div class="t m108 x30 hd y90f ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The day before the baptism, the believers carried water to fill the </div><div class="t m5d1 x30 hd y910 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">barrel.

He </div><div class="t m6c9 x11 hd y912 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">realized that it must have rained during the night, although he had not </div><div class="t m5e4 x30 hd y913 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">heard rain, even on his house&apos;s metal roof. Excited, he hurried to the </div><div class="t m99 x11 hd y914 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">river and found the water level was up to his chest! He ran to tell the </div><div class="t m6ca x11 hd y581 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">pastor the good news. </div><div class="t m5e5 x64 hd y915 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The believers gathered under the clear sky to worship and praise </div><div class="t m6cb x30 hd y916 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">God and then moved to the river for the baptism.

He walked some distance to another channel of the same river </div><div class="t m664 x30 hd y91b ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and found water there. Apparently, Friday night&apos;s rain had caused the </div><div class="t m6b0 x11 hd y62a ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">river to change course and fill the river channel nearest the village. </div><div class="t m6cd x11 hd y91c ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">When the water receded, the river returned to its normal channel. </div><div class="t m4c x64 hd y91d ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The villagers were amazed that the rain had filled the river channel </div><div class="t m1ed x11 hd y91e ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in answer to the prayers of the believers and then left it dry the </div><div class="t m6ce x99 hd y863 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">next day.
