But an eight-month drought had left the nearby </div><div class="t m58b x12 hf yd0 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">river dry. Some skeptical villagers jeered at the Adventists, who </div><div class="t mf1 x12 hf y90f ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">insisted on baptizing by immersion, even when there was no water. </div><div class="t m273 x31 hf y57b ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The only alternative was to baptize the new believers in an oil drum. </div><div class="t m108 x31 hf y910 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The day before the baptism, the believers carried water to fill the </div><div class="t m5d1 x31 hf y911 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">barrel.

Excited, he hurried to the </div><div class="t m99 x12 hf y915 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">river and found the water level was up to his chest!
