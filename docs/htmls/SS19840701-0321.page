But we truly accept God&apos;s forgiveness only when we </div><div class="t mf8 x5 h24 y391 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">repent and allow Him to help us change the kind of people we are. Those </div><div class="t mb9 x5 h24 y392 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">who gratefully accept divine pardon cannot continue to be obstinate be-</div><div class="t m366 x5 h24 y393 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">fore God. Our hearts must change. Repentance includes not only godly </div><div class="t m367 x5 h24 y394 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sorrow for sin but a turning from it. </div><div class="t m195 x5c h24 y395 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Walking with God&quot; is one image used to convey the concept of our </div><div class="t m345 x5 h24 y396 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">intimate experience with the Lord. But the prophet Jeremiah makes it </div><div class="t m368 x5 h24 y397 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">clear that no matter how long we may have walked with God, when sin </div><div class="t m139 x39 h24 y398 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">breaks that walk we are out of step with Him. A knowledge of God in-</div><div class="t m369 x5 h24 y399 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">cludes far more than a mere intellectual understanding of doctrines about </div><div class="t m232 x5 h24 y39a ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Him. We often talk about knowing someone with whom we have not </div><div class="t m36a x5 h24 y39b ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">spoken in years. In the Scriptures, however, knowledge indicates more </div><div class="t m11e x39 h24 y39c ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">than acquaintanceship. It points to closeness, continual association, and </div><div class="t m36b x5 h24 y39d ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">a feel for the other person. Sensitivity may be the most accurate idea. If </div><div class="t m1d5 x39 h24 y39e ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">you hurt a close friend and no longer speak to that person, it can be said </div><div class="t m16a x39 h24 y39f ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that you no longer really know each other. That is true also of our rela-</div><div class="t m2c6 x39 h24 y3a0 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tionship with God. </div><div class="t m36c x6c h25 y3a1 ff6 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">What is the implication of Jesus&apos; statement found in Matthew 12:30 that </div><div class="t m36d x5 h25 yb0 ff6 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;he that is not with me is against me&quot;? </div><div class="t m31f x6c h24 y3a2 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The text indicates that those who do not relate fully to Jesus are not </div><div class="t m36e x39 h24 y3a3 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">with Him. Either we have accepted His offer of forgiveness, or we remain </div><div class="t m36f x39 h24 y3a4 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in our sins. There are no &quot;moderate&quot; or &quot;shallow&quot; relationships with </div><div class="t m370 x39 h24 y3a5 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">God. It is all or nothing. This should not be taken to mean that there are </div><div class="t m371 x39 h24 y3a6 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">no ups and downs in the Christian experience or that there is no growth, </div><div class="t m372 x39 h24 y3a7 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">only that we should know whether or not we have made a full commit-</div><div class="t m373 x39 h24 y3a8 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ment to God through Jesus Christ. In this respect it is similar to our hu-</div><div class="t m374 x39 h24 y3a9 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">man relationships. No one ever should say that a child has only a &quot;shal-</div><div class="t m2d2 x39 h24 y3aa ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">low&quot; relationship to his mother. That relationship may be the most </div><div class="t m375 x39 h24 y3ab ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">meaningful of his life, even if it is a poor one. So, Jesus prayed: &quot;This is </div><div class="t m13d x39 h24 y3ac ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">life eternal, that they might </div><div class="t m376 xaa h17 y3ad ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">know </div><div class="t m377 x5f h24 y3ae ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">thee&quot; (John 17:3).
