She began reading the </div><div class="t m2ce x7d h28 y11c ff3 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Bible and found many references to the Sabbath. But which day </div><div class="t m221 x7d h28 y11d ff3 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was Sabbath? The Christians she knew celebrate Jesus&apos; crucifixion </div><div class="t m216 x7d h28 y13f ff3 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">on Friday, so the Sabbath should be on Saturday. But why then did </div><div class="t m2cf x7d h28 y1f6 ff3 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">they worship on Sunday instead of Sabbath? she wondered. </div><div class="t m2d0 x56 h28 y293 ff3 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">She knew that somewhere there must be people who live ac-</div><div class="t m2d1 x7d h28 yfd ff3 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">cording to the principles of God&apos;s law. But how could she find </div><div class="t m2d2 x7d h28 y294 ff3 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">them? She kept praying that God would show her His truth. </div><div class="t m139 x56 h28 y284 ff3 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Her family greeted her questions with indifference and even </div><div class="t m2d3 x7d h28 y6e ff3 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">animosity. &quot;You should not be reading this book! Why can&apos;t you </div><div class="t m2d4 x7d h28 y128 ff3 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">be satisfied with the church you grew up in?&quot; they asked her. But </div><div class="t m2d5 x7d h28 y295 ff3 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">their comments failed to deter her in her search for God. </div><div class="t m2d6 x56 h28 y52 ff3 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Biruthe&apos;s search for truth continued several months. She learned </div><div class="t m2be x7d h28 y296 ff3 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that God expected His followers to return a tithe of their income to </div><div class="t m2a5 x3e h28 y286 ff3 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">God. She thought, I </div><div class="t m24a x7e hc y297 ff7 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">want to pay tithe, but to whom shall I pay it? </div><div class="t m2d7 x56 h28 ydc ff3 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">When she heard of evangelistic meetings being held in her city, </div><div class="t m2bc x3e h28 ydd ff3 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">she decided to attend. Perhaps these people knew where to find the </div><div class="t m2cb x3e h28 y298 ff3 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">true church. She arrived at the lecture hall early the first night. She </div><div class="t m48 x3e h28 y287 ff3 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was impressed with the friendliness and humility of the women </div><div class="t m2ca x3e h28 y1e1 ff3 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">who greeted her. The preacher&apos;s words were warm, and his mes-</div><div class="t m136 x3e h28 y288 ff3 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sage was backed by texts from the Bible. She could almost hear </div><div class="t m2d8 x3e h28 y289 ff3 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">God saying, &quot;Here are the people whom I told you to look for!&quot; </div><div class="t m2d9 x56 h28 ye1 ff3 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">When the preacher presented the Sabbath, she nearly jumped </div><div class="t m2da x27 h28 y28a ff3 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">from her seat, for she knew she had found God&apos;s true church. And </div><div class="t m2db x3e h28 y28b ff3 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">when the pastor invited those who wanted to follow Jesus to stand, </div><div class="t m2dc x27 h28 y299 ff3 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Birhute was the first to her feet. She eagerly joined the baptismal </div><div class="t m2dd x27 h28 y1e7 ff3 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">class. </div><div class="t mab x64 h28 y1e8 ff3 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Following her baptism her eyes began to bother her. The doctors </div><div class="t m2de x27 h28 y29a ff3 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">told her the redness and itching she was experiencing could not be </div><div class="t m2df x27 h28 y29b ff3 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">treated but would continue the rest of her life. She found it difficult </div><div class="t m2e0 x27 h28 y29c ff3 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to read her Bible and begged God to heal her so she could again </div><div class="t m175 x27 h28 y29d ff3 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">read her Bible. That night she dreamed that a doctor put a certain </div><div class="t m2e1 x27 h28 y29e ff3 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">oil on her eyes. The next day she bought the oil and applied it. </div><div class="t m2e2 x27 h28 y29f ff3 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Within a week her eyes were clear.
