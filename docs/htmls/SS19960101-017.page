As we present various methods of Bible study this </div><div class="t mb7 x16 h15 yc1 ff2 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">quarter, we first wish to emphasize that the Bible, the infallible Word </div><div class="t mb8 x3e h15 yc2 ff2 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of God, is its own interpreter. By this we mean that the Holy Spirit </div><div class="t mb9 x3e h15 yf ff2 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">enables Christ&apos;s true followers to see the relationships between Bible </div><div class="t mb1 x3e h15 yc3 ff2 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">passages, interpreting the message of one passage in the light of all </div><div class="t mba x3e h15 yc4 ff2 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">other Bible truth on the same subject. </div><div class="t mbb x3f h15 yc5 ff2 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Never before in the history of the world has the Bible been more </div><div class="t mbc x3e h15 yc6 ff2 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">available to the general population.

But at the same time, there seems to be a famine of God&apos;s </div><div class="t mbe x3e h15 yc9 ff2 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Word. We have Bibles everywhere—in motels, doctors&apos; offices, </div><div class="t mbf x3e h15 yca ff2 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">libraries, and most homes in some countries. Yet research indicates </div><div class="t mc0 x3e h15 ycb ff2 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that many are ignorant of what the Bible has to say, and still others </div><div class="t mc1 x3e h15 ycc ff2 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">seldom apply Bible truths to the practice of their religion. </div><div class="t mc2 x3f h15 ycd ff2 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The Bible teaches us that being a disciple of Jesus Christ involves </div><div class="t mc3 x3e h15 yce ff2 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">becoming acquainted with His Word.
