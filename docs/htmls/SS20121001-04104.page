She </div><div class="t m0 x39 h5 ya98 ff14 fs4 fc3 sc0 ls2 wsca">trudged out of the village through the deepening snow. “God, show me </div><div class="t m0 x39 h5 ya99 ff14 fs4 fc3 sc0 ls2 wsb0">the way,” she prayed. Immediately a light illuminated her path, and she </div><div class="t m0 x39 h5 ya9a ff14 fs4 fc3 sc0 ls2 ws6">followed it.
