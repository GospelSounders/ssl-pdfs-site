It is now recognized that in the ancient </div><div class="t m253 x3d h12 y3cd ff4 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">world generally, kingship was sacral—a sacred, cultic office as well </div><div class="t m32d x3d h12 y7f ff4 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">as a political position. The king was, in fact, universally acknowl-</div><div class="t m2bc x3d h12 y3ce ff4 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">edged as a mediator between god(s) and people. This inevitably led </div><div class="t m32e x3d h12 y376 ff4 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to his being considered at least a semidivine person. In Egypt, in-</div><div class="t m32f x3d h12 y3cf ff4 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">deed, the king was accorded full divine honors; he was a god in </div><div class="t m330 x3d h12 y3d0 ff4 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">human form. In Babylonia, on the other hand, the king was recog-</div><div class="t m331 x3d h12 y3d1 ff4 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">nized as a human being, elevated to near-divine status. . . . Despite </div><div class="t mdc x3d h12 y85 ff4 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the differences, in both areas the king was pivotal in the cultic beliefs </div><div class="t m309 x3d h12 y86 ff4 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and practices. No doubt the Canaanites followed a similar pattern; in </div><div class="t m332 x3d h12 y87 ff4 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the Ras Shamrah tablets the Canaanite king Keret (Kirta, Kirtu) is </div><div class="t m333 x3d h12 y88 ff4 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">styled both the &apos;servant of [the deity] El&apos; and the &apos;son of El.&apos;. . .
