However, that is not what </div><div class="t m287 x54 h10 y25c ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">happened. Adonijah&apos;s request was not spurred on by any love for Abishag; </div><div class="t m288 x54 h10 y25d ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">instead, it was another attempt to try and usurp Solomon&apos;s power. It was a </div><div class="t m137 x54 h10 y25e ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">custom of the times that a new king would inherit the former king&apos;s </div><div class="t m289 x54 h10 y25f ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">concubines and sometimes his wives; thus, Solomon saw the request for </div><div class="t m1fa x54 h10 y260 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">what it was—an attempt to do through palace intrigue what was not </div><div class="t m28a x54 h10 y261 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">accomplished by force. Solomon&apos;s words in verse 22 (&quot;Ask for him the </div><div class="t m28b x54 h10 y262 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">kingdom also?&quot;) show that he knew what was going on. &quot;The real burden </div><div class="t m28c x54 h10 y263 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of his heart was probably not a romantic concern for the fair Abishag, but </div><div class="t m143 x54 h10 y264 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the kingdom he hoped to acquire by possession of her. . . . Abishag was </div><div class="t m12 x54 h10 y265 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">doubtless looked upon as the last wife, or at least the last concubine, of </div><div class="t m246 x54 h10 y266 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">David. For Adonijah now to ask for Abishag could be construed as asking </div><div class="t m28d x54 h10 y267 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">for the throne itself.&quot;—The </div><div class="t m28e x24 h10 y267 ff4 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">SDA Bible Commentary, </div><div class="t mc3 x2a h10 y267 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">vol. 2, p. 733:17, </div><div class="t m28f x54 h10 y268 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Give me Abishag.&quot; </div><div class="t m290 x5 hf y269 ff3 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Perhaps what is most interesting about this story is that Adonijah, </div><div class="t m291 x54 hf y26a ff3 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in verse 15, admits to Bathsheba that, though many people </div><div class="t mb9 x54 hf y26b ff3 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">expected him to be king, Solomon took the throne instead. Indeed, </div><div class="t m292 x54 hf y26c ff3 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Adonijah says &quot;for it was his from the Lord.&quot; Here was a confes-</div><div class="t m1fc x54 hf y26d ff3 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sion, from his own lips, that the Lord was behind his brother&apos;s </div><div class="t m293 x54 hf y26e ff3 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ascension to the throne. How does this help us understand Solomon&apos;s </div><div class="t m294 x54 hf y26f ff3 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">actions toward him? </div><div class="t m295 x5 h10 y270 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">As human beings, we are endowed with a gift not found among other </div><div class="t m296 x54 h10 y271 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">flesh-and-blood creatures, and that is reason (in fact, some say that the only </div><div class="t m297 x54 h10 y272 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">thing that differentiates us from the animals is our reason). Yet, we are also </div><div class="t m298 x54 h10 y273 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">creatures of emotion, of passion, of primal urges. Ideally, though our reason </div><div class="t m299 x54 h10 y274 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">should be used to control our emotions and passions and urges, such is not </div><div class="t m29a x54 h10 y275 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">always the paradigm. Adonijah is a good case in point. He admitted that </div><div class="t m29b x54 h10 y276 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">God gave Solomon the throne, and his life, which should have been snuffed </div><div class="t m29c x54 h10 y277 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">out immediately, was spared only by Solomon&apos;s graciousness. Reason, no </div><div class="t m29d x54 h10 y278 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">doubt, told him, </div><div class="t m29e x89 h10 y279 ff4 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Let it go; be glad you did not get your head chopped off </div><div class="t m29f x54 h10 y27a ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">However, it seems that his lower passions—lust for power, rebellion, </div><div class="t m2a0 x46 h10 y27b ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">jealousy, and the desire for self-exaltation—overruled what simple reason </div><div class="t m2a1 x54 h10 y27c ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">clearly showed should have been his course of action. </div><div class="t m89 x4c hf y27d ff3 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">How many lives have you seen ruined when someone allowed </div><div class="t m2a2 x6a hf y27e ff3 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">brewing, stewing passions to overcome and crush out simple logic </div><div class="t m2a3 x6a hf y27f ff3 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and reason?
