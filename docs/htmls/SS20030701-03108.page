For example, </div><div class="t m67d x30 h30 y6b1 ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">John 5:24 reads, &quot;Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my </div><div class="t m67e x30 h30 y96e ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">word, and believeth on him that sent me, </div><div class="t m67f xbe h30 y6b2 ff6 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">hath </div><div class="t m493 x95 h30 ya6b ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">everlasting life, and </div><div class="t m680 x30 h30 y7bf ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life&quot; </div><div class="t m48f x30 h30 y6b4 ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">(emphasis supplied). Thus, we are already saved; we have eternal life, </div><div class="t m1a0 x30 h30 y7c0 ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">even now. In contrast, Matthew 19:29 reads, &quot;And every one that hath </div><div class="t m160 x30 h30 y6b6 ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">forsaken houses, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, </div><div class="t m3cc x30 h30 y6b7 ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">or children, or lands, for my name&apos;s sake, shall receive an hundred-</div><div class="t m31 x30 h30 y9b0 ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">fold, and </div><div class="t m603 x57 h30 y7c1 ff6 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">shall inherit </div><div class="t m17b x4f h30 y6b8 ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">everlasting life&quot; (emphasis supplied). In other </div><div class="t m681 x30 h30 y6b9 ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">words, final salvation is yet to come (for another example of this </div><div class="t m4a1 x30 h30 ya6c ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">contrast, see Ephesians 2:6 and Romans 8:22-24). </div><div class="t m682 x4a h2e y6bc ff5 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">In what ways does this already/not-yet tension appear in He-</div><div class="t m683 x30 h2e y6bd ff5 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">brews? See Hebrews 12:28, 11:13-16. How can we resolve this </div><div class="t m180 x30 h2e y183 ff5 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tension? Or should we? </div><div class="t m360 x49 h30 y6c1 ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">There are all sorts of tensions in the Bible that, if properly under-</div><div class="t m80 x30 h30 y6c2 ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">stood, actually harmonize with each other in helping fill in the big </div><div class="t m80 x30 h30 y7c4 ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">picture. The problem comes when we emphasize one aspect at the </div><div class="t m20e x30 h30 y6c4 ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">expense of another; instead, we should attempt to balance them out. </div><div class="t m684 x49 h30 ya6d ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The Bible is full of statements that seem to be opposed to each </div><div class="t m685 x30 h30 y7c7 ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">other and yet both are true: While living on earth, Jesus was fully </div><div class="t m63f x30 h30 y6c6 ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">divine and fully human. The Bible is written by human authors; even </div><div class="t m686 x30 h30 y6c7 ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">so, it is the Word of God. God is independent of time, though He </div><div class="t m3af x30 h30 y7c8 ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">relates to us in time. There is one Godhead, but the Father, Son, and </div><div class="t m687 x30 h30 y7c9 ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Holy Spirit are called God. We are saved by faith and judged by </div><div class="t m43c x30 h30 y7ca ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">works. </div><div class="t m688 x49 h30 y930 ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">When it comes to God and His plan of salvation, we have to </div><div class="t m65f x30 h30 y6cb ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">acknowledge that our mind can grasp only part of the reality, a few </div><div class="t m689 x30 h30 y931 ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">slices at best. In such a context, we must realize, too, that opposites </div><div class="t m13a x30 h30 y35e ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">are not necessarily contradictory but can simply be different parts of a </div><div class="t m68a x30 h30 y7ce ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">much bigger picture. Trouble comes when we focus too much on a </div><div class="t m3ac x30 h30 y6ce ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">single part at the expense of the whole. </div><div class="t m396 x1b h2e y7d0 ff5 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Look up these verses: John 3:15, 36; 1 Timothy 6:12; 1 John </div><div class="t m68b xf h2e y6d1 ff5 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">5:12, 13.
