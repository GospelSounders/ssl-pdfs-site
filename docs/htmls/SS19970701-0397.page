But </div><div class="t m709 x23 h1b ya74 ff4 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Adriano had found something that he could not deny, and he </div><div class="t m70a x23 h1b ya75 ff4 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">held fast to his faith. He sang in a choir that traveled to other </div><div class="t m70b x23 h1b ya76 ff4 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">towns to witness for the church.

The </div><div class="t m1f0 x20 h1b y1d6 ff4 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">family was shocked and saddened but asked the Adventist pastor </div><div class="t m24 x20 h1b ya78 ff4 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to speak. </div><div class="t m70e x4a h1b ya79 ff4 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The pastor told of Adriano&apos;s influence on the church mem-</div><div class="t m70f x20 h1b ya7a ff4 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">bers and encouraged the family to honor Adriano&apos;s faith.
