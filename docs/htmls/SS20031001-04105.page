She </div><div class="t m389 x70 h19 y936 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">continued her search until she found a small group of Sabbathkeepers </div><div class="t mbc x70 h19 y937 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">who met in the home of one of their members. But the congrega-</div><div class="t m21c x70 h19 y938 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tion was not Adventist. As she visited the little group of believers </div><div class="t m265 x70 h19 y939 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">she discovered their interesting origin. </div><div class="t m2b1 x21 h19 y93a ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">During World War II the United States offered the assistance of </div><div class="t m256 x70 h19 y93b ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">military specialists to help the struggling Chinese army. Appar-</div><div class="t m631 x70 h19 y93c ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ently a Seventh-day Adventist military chaplain was assigned to </div><div class="t mbc x70 h19 y855 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the region where this little group of believers lived. The chaplain </div><div class="t m64 x70 h19 y93d ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">did more than just meet the needs of the military personnel; he </div><div class="t mb9 x70 h19 y93e ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">shared his faith with the local people, and eventually he led seven </div><div class="t m336 x1e h19 y93f ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of them to Christ. Shortly after he baptized the new believers, the </div><div class="t m478 x1e h19 y940 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">chaplain and his unit left the area. </div><div class="t m5dd x11 h19 y941 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The little group of believers managed to build a tiny chapel, but </div><div class="t m215 x1e h19 y942 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">it burned down shortly after completion. Through the stormy </div><div class="t m5d3 x1e h19 y943 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">decades of Communism, atheism, and the stifling pressures of the </div><div class="t m3ec x1e h19 y944 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Chinese Cultural Revolution, the little group of believers managed </div><div class="t mde x1e h19 y85e ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to continue worshiping, perhaps because they were isolated from </div><div class="t m138 x1e h19 yd6 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">large population centers. But over the years, without the presence </div><div class="t m6ad x1e h19 y945 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of a minister, the little group lost nearly all of the Adventist </div><div class="t m114 x1e h19 y946 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">beliefs, but it managed to cling to the Sabbath and their belief that </div><div class="t m6ae x1e h19 y947 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Jesus is coming soon. They thought they were the only </div><div class="t m15a x1e h19 y948 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Sabbathkeeping Christians in the world. </div><div class="t m47f x11 h19 y949 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Chan rejoiced to tell the little congregation that they were a part </div><div class="t m28a x1e h19 y94a ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of a worldwide group of believers.
