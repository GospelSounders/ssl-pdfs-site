Just before his 30th birthday Alex decided </div><div class="t m327 xaf ha y36d ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that his life was going in the wrong direction; he needed God. He began </div><div class="t m759 xaf ha y9a4 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">attending a Messianic synagogue, where he eventually filled leadership </div><div class="t m37 xaf ha y36f ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">positions. But Alex felt hungry for a deeper knowledge of God. </div><div class="t m35 x19 ha y370 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Some Protestants encouraged him to enroll in a Protestant Bible semi-</div><div class="t m47e xaf ha y4e6 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">nary, where he eventually earned a degree in pastoral ministry. Upon grad-</div><div class="t m298 xaf ha y9a5 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">uation he became an associate pastor of a large Protestant church. There </div><div class="t m2e7 xaf ha y4e8 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">he helped plant several new churches. While he enjoyed his work, he </div><div class="t m75a xaf ha y4e9 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">missed his Hebrew roots. Over the months his burden for his Jewish her-</div><div class="t m15b xaf ha y4ea ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">itage grew. </div><div class="t me4 x17 ha y372 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">He and his wife started a Messianic synagogue. It was good to sing the </div><div class="t m171 xaf ha y4eb ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Hebrew songs, preach from the Torah, and use his knowledge of Hebrew. </div><div class="t m461 xaf ha y374 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Then during a vacation to Florida, Alex and his wife decided to return to </div><div class="t m6ab xaf ha y4ec ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">their native state.
