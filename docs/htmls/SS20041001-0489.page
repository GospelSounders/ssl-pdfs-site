Just before his 30th birthday Alex decided </div><div class="t m327 xae h8 y36c ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that his life was going in the wrong direction; he needed God. He began </div><div class="t m759 xae h8 y9a3 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">attending a Messianic synagogue, where he eventually filled leadership </div><div class="t m37 xae h8 y36e ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">positions. But Alex felt hungry for a deeper knowledge of God. </div><div class="t m35 x18 h8 y36f ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Some Protestants encouraged him to enroll in a Protestant Bible semi-</div><div class="t m47e xae h8 y4e5 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">nary, where he eventually earned a degree in pastoral ministry. Upon grad-</div><div class="t m298 xae h8 y9a4 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">uation he became an associate pastor of a large Protestant church. There </div><div class="t m2e7 xae h8 y4e7 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">he helped plant several new churches. While he enjoyed his work, he </div><div class="t m75a xae h8 y4e8 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">missed his Hebrew roots.

It was good to sing the </div><div class="t m171 xae h8 y4ea ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Hebrew songs, preach from the Torah, and use his knowledge of Hebrew. </div><div class="t m461 xae h8 y373 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Then during a vacation to Florida, Alex and his wife decided to return to </div><div class="t m6ab xae h8 y4eb ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">their native state.
