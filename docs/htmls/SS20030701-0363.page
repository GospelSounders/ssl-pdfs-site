While Hebrews 7 presents Jesus as </div><div class="t m25f x69 he y6a1 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Priest, Hebrews 8-10 prefer to depict Jesus as Sacrifice. Hence, we </div><div class="t m405 x69 he y6a2 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">can see the link between Sacrifice, covenant, and Mediator. </div><div class="t m51f x44 he y5fd ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;By </div><div class="t md4 x7a hd y37f ff5 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">so much was Jesus made a surety [or guarantee] of a better </div><div class="t m26d x69 hd y6a3 ff5 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">testament&quot; (Heb. 7:22). What does &quot;surety&quot; in this context mean? </div><div class="t m126 x44 he y385 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Surety&quot; or &quot;guarantee&quot; occurs nowhere else in the New Testa-</div><div class="t m473 x69 he y6a4 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ment. &quot;It is common in the papyri in legal documents in the sense of </div><div class="t m520 x69 he y387 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">a pledge or as a reference to bail. . . . Since the covenant in the </div><div class="t m3f5 x69 he y6a5 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">biblical sense is an agreement initiated by God, the surety (i.e. Jesus) </div><div class="t m447 x69 he y389 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">guarantees that that covenant will be honoured. . . .
