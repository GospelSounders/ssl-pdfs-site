It </div><div class="t m582 x7a h6 y897 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was the market place, social center, and hall of justice. The gate at </div><div class="t m4df x9d h6 y862 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Persepolis measured 60 by 30 meters, and the gate at Susa must have been </div><div class="t m583 x7a h6 y898 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">comparable in size. Much activity must have been continually going on </div><div class="t m584 x7a h6 y865 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">there. Esther 2:19, 21 depicts Mordecai sitting at the city gate. Most likely </div><div class="t m585 x7a h6 y2 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">he was not just lounging there, but was involved in some civic or royal </div><div class="t m586 x7a h6 y4dc ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">activity. </div><div class="t m587 x38 h6 y899 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Sitting in the gate&quot; is often a legal term in Scripture. &quot;Mordecai be-</div><div class="t m588 x7a h6 y89a ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">came—if he was not already . . . a palace attendant or minor official.

It is </div><div class="t m4bf x3 h6 y8a3 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">almost as old as sin itself. </div><div class="t m594 x2c h15 y26e ff4 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">What steps did Mordecai take to let the king know about the plot? </div><div class="t m4a x3 h15 y8a4 ff4 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">What did the king do when he learned about it? Esther 2:22, 23. </div><div class="t m595 x2c h6 y273 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Mordecai told Esther about the plot.
