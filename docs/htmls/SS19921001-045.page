The deeper meanings of its images and symbols will </div><div class="t m9c x31 he y88 ff5 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">challenge the careful Bible student. If the literary quality itself is </div><div class="t m9d x31 he y89 ff5 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">striking, its theme is even more so. The Song of Solomon addresses </div><div class="t m9e x31 he y8a ff5 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the fundamental human need for love and intimacy. If we will </div><div class="t m9f x31 he y8b ff5 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">permit it to do so, the Song reveals to us heaven&apos;s perspective on </div><div class="t ma0 x31 he y8c ff5 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">human sexualityâ€”God&apos;s gift to us at Creation, which serves to </div><div class="t ma1 x31 he y8d ff5 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">shape and control so much of our action and interaction with one </div><div class="t m3b x31 he y8e ff5 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">another. </div><div class="t ma2 x30 he y8f ff5 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Specifically, the Song portrays in the most delicate terms the </div><div class="t m9a x31 he y90 ff5 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">attraction, the passion, the tenderness, the unbounded delights of </div><div class="t ma3 x31 he y91 ff5 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the relationship between a husband and wife.
