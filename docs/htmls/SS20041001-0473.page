Times were tough, but the company had plenty of work. </div><div class="t m6ba x9b h8 y845 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">One day the five men were called into the supervisor&apos;s office and told that </div><div class="t m1e0 x9b h8 y846 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the company was going to work six days a week to meet orders. </div><div class="t m550 x60 h8 y847 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The Adventist men already were working extra hours every weekday in </div><div class="t m6aa x9b h8 y848 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">order to avoid working on Sabbath. But the boss pressured them to agree to </div><div class="t m172 x9b h8 y849 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">work even more. When the supervisor saw that the men would not budge </div><div class="t m49c x9b h8 y84a ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in their refusal to work on Saturdays, he asked the five Adventists to resign. </div><div class="t maf x60 h8 y209 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The friends talked it over and decided to trust God to provide work. They </div><div class="t m178 x9b h8 y84b ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">agreed to quit. &quot;God will provide for us,&quot; they said. &quot;We are not worried.&quot; </div><div class="t m3a x60 h8 y6e1 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The men applied for work at a similar company in town and were hired </div><div class="t m3b0 x9b h8 y84c ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">as sub-contractors. Their work continued for two years, until that company </div><div class="t m1f8 x9b h8 y84d ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">began having financial trouble, and they were laid off. </div><div class="t m3cb x60 h8 y84e ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The friends built furniture to earn a living, but eventually this, too, did </div><div class="t m3cc x9b h8 y84f ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">not adequately support them. So the men found various jobs—one as a bus </div><div class="t m6bb x9b h8 y850 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">driver, another as a chauffeur, and one continued making furniture. </div><div class="t m643 x14 h8 y851 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Alex, one of the friends, had long resisted an impression he felt to </div><div class="t m6bc x9b h8 y852 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">become a pastor. He worried that he could not support his family and attend </div><div class="t m5b8 x9c h8 y740 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">college. But his wife urged him to follow his calling, so the couple sold </div><div class="t m1d2 x9b h8 y853 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">their car, and Alex went to school. It was tough, but God provided.
