I had gone to the church office to pick up two </div><div class="t m2a4 xc hd y2d8 ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Bibles to take to the evangelistic meeting that night. As I walked </div><div class="t m2a5 x2b hd y2d9 ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">along the street, I sensed that someone was following me. I glanced </div><div class="t m1e5 x2b hd y2da ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">behind me and saw a young man who had been on the same bus as </div><div class="t m9e xc hd y2db ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I.
