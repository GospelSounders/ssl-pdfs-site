The entire village soon </div><div class="t m69 x5 hb y4c9 ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">appeared to see the foreigner from America. The village chief, </div><div class="t m6ce x5 hb y6f4 ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Tibulawan, welcomed me.

The first-grade students ranged in age from 6 to 20, all </div><div class="t md7 xa8 hb y658 ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">learning to read and write together. In the evenings, the villagers </div><div class="t m6d0 xa8 hb y1c5 ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">gathered to listen to the student missionaries lead in Bible studies. </div><div class="t m6d1 x4 hb y4cb ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Before that year was over Chief Tibulawan and 26 of his people </div><div class="t m374 xa8 hb y4cc ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">were ready for baptism. Eventually the entire village followed </div><div class="t m363 xa8 hb y4cd ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">their chiefs example and were baptized as Seventh-day Adventists. </div><div class="t m356 x4 hb y4ce ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The message of Christ&apos;s soon coming spread to other villages in </div><div class="t m9 xa8 hb y6f6 ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the area. Then funds ran out, and the student evangelists no longer </div><div class="t m6d2 xa8 hb y4d0 ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">came to teach in Dampaan. Fifteen years passed.
