The entire village soon </div><div class="t m69 x6 hd y4ca ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">appeared to see the foreigner from America. The village chief, </div><div class="t m6ce x6 hd y6f5 ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Tibulawan, welcomed me. During the visit, the chief made an </div><div class="t m554 x6 hd y40c ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">appeal, &quot;Please send us a teacher.&quot; </div><div class="t m6cf x5 hd y6f6 ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Several weeks later, two student missionaries from Mountain </div><div class="t m530 x6 hd y4cb ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">View College in the Philippines arrived in Dampaan and started a </div><div class="t m319 x6 hd y274 ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">school. The first-grade students ranged in age from 6 to 20, all </div><div class="t md7 xa8 hd y659 ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">learning to read and write together. In the evenings, the villagers </div><div class="t m6d0 xa8 hd y1c6 ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">gathered to listen to the student missionaries lead in Bible studies. </div><div class="t m6d1 x5 hd y4cc ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Before that year was over Chief Tibulawan and 26 of his people </div><div class="t m374 xa8 hd y4cd ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">were ready for baptism. Eventually the entire village followed </div><div class="t m363 xa8 hd y4ce ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">their chiefs example and were baptized as Seventh-day Adventists. </div><div class="t m356 x5 hd y4cf ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The message of Christ&apos;s soon coming spread to other villages in </div><div class="t m9 xa8 hd y6f7 ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the area. Then funds ran out, and the student evangelists no longer </div><div class="t m6d2 xa8 hd y4d1 ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">came to teach in Dampaan. Fifteen years passed. Then recently </div><div class="t m1d1 xa8 hd y1cc ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">missionaries from Mountain View College visited Dampaan one </div><div class="t m6d3 xa8 hd y4d3 ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Sabbath morning. No one knew they were coming. As they neared </div><div class="t m6d4 xa8 hd y4d4 ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the village, they heard singing. To their joy they found the villagers </div><div class="t m32f xa8 hd y6f8 ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">worshiping God. Chief Tibulawan preached. Unable to read, he </div><div class="t mb6 xa8 hd y358 ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">quoted Bible texts that he had memorized.
