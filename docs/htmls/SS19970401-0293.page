As John says, &quot;you should pray </div><div class="t m531 x8 h16 ya2e ff3 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to God, who will give him life&quot; (1 John 5:16, TEV). God&apos;s nature is </div><div class="t m3b6 x8 h16 ya2f ff3 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">inclusive, &quot;not wanting anyone to perish, but everyone to come to </div><div class="t m21f x8 h16 ya30 ff3 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">repentance&quot; (2 Peter 3:9, NIV). God is always there to save, revive, </div><div class="t m34c x8 h16 ya31 ff3 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and reestablish the one who has fallen. While we do not believe in the </div><div class="t m13b x8 h16 ya32 ff3 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">doctrine of once-saved-always-saved, in our attitudes we can give the </div><div class="t m1b2 x8 h16 ya33 ff3 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">impression of once-lost-always-lost. </div><div class="t m427 x41 h26 ya34 ff2 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">What is the difference between sin to death and that which is </div><div class="t m3a7 x8 h26 ya35 ff2 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">not? 1 John 5:16, 17. </div><div class="t m4d4 x41 h16 ya36 ff3 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Some have developed curious doctrines from this verse—that there </div><div class="t m653 x48 h16 ya37 ff3 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">are </div><div class="t m443 x1b h16 ya37 ff5 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">mortal </div><div class="t m152 x50 h16 ya37 ff3 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sins and </div><div class="t m1b2 x66 h16 ya37 ff5 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">venial </div><div class="t m1dd xa1 h16 ya37 ff3 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sins, for example.

As Jesus made clear, blasphemy against the Holy Spirit is </div><div class="t m654 x48 h16 ya3a ff3 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">unforgivable (Mark 3:29) because it is the Holy Spirit who convicts of </div><div class="t m655 x48 h16 ya3b ff3 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sin (John 16:8-11). So to resist the conviction of sinfulness is denial of </div><div class="t m49 x48 h16 ya3c ff3 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sin and rejection of God&apos;s desire to forgive and restore. God will not </div><div class="t m12d x48 h16 ya3d ff3 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">impose Himself on anyone who rejects Him. </div><div class="t m2b3 x22 h26 ya3e ff2 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">So how should we pray—especially with and for others?
