But her former lifestyle was making it difficult, </div><div class="t m399 x71 hd y1e0 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and the dance hall and beer parlor were their only source of </div><div class="t m4e4 x71 hd y1e1 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">income. </div><div class="t m4e5 x25 hd y1e2 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Mori knew that her young children were being influenced by </div><div class="t m4e6 x71 hd y5c8 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the people who frequented their establishment next door. She </div><div class="t m4e7 x71 hd y1e4 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">pleaded with her husband to find different work. What would </div><div class="t m283 x71 hd y1e5 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">become of their children as they grew up with this bad influence? </div><div class="t m227 x71 hd y39e ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">What future would they have? </div><div class="t m404 x25 hd y1e7 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Although her husband is not a Christian, he agreed to try to find </div><div class="t m43e x71 hd y39f ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">work in Port Moresby. While he was gone, Mori tore down the </div><div class="t m4e8 x71 hd y1e9 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">dance hall and built a bush church from woven bamboo walls and </div><div class="t m1ab x71 hd y3a0 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">a grass roof. </div><div class="t m16a x25 hd y1eb ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">With tender love she decorated the church.
