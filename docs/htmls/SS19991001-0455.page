But her former lifestyle was making it difficult, </div><div class="t m399 x70 hb y1df ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and the dance hall and beer parlor were their only source of </div><div class="t m4e4 x70 hb y1e0 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">income. </div><div class="t m4e5 x24 hb y1e1 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Mori knew that her young children were being influenced by </div><div class="t m4e6 x70 hb y5c7 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the people who frequented their establishment next door. She </div><div class="t m4e7 x70 hb y1e3 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">pleaded with her husband to find different work. What would </div><div class="t m283 x70 hb y1e4 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">become of their children as they grew up with this bad influence? </div><div class="t m227 x70 hb y39d ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">What future would they have? </div><div class="t m404 x24 hb y1e6 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Although her husband is not a Christian, he agreed to try to find </div><div class="t m43e x70 hb y39e ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">work in Port Moresby.
