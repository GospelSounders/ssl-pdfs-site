Then he ordered the Tutsis to move to one side. </div><div class="t m1d4 x43 hc y568 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Rachel stepped from the line and joined the second group. A man </div><div class="t m51a x43 hc y464 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">carrying a weapon walked down the line telling the students, &quot;You&apos;d </div><div class="t m61b x43 hc y1ce ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">better pray; in ten minutes you will be dead.&quot; </div><div class="t m61c x46 hc y466 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">As the killer reached the far end of the line, someone pulled Rachel </div><div class="t m223 x43 hc y569 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">from the line and pushed her toward some bushes to hide. She was </div><div class="t m178 x43 hc y506 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">spared. Several more times in the days ahead Rachel escaped death </div><div class="t m26c x43 hc y1d2 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">when those around her were killed. </div><div class="t m61d xb1 hc y1d2 ff6 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Why me? </div><div class="t m61e x32 hc y1d2 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">she wondered. </div><div class="t m61e x46 hc y468 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Some students fled to another city where they thought they would </div><div class="t m61f x43 hc y1d4 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">he safe. But they soon learned that there was no safe place. However, </div><div class="t m23b x43 hc y56a ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">again and again the handful of students were spared certain death. </div><div class="t m61d x45 hc y1d6 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">A family took her into their home and hid her. While she was there, </div><div class="t m620 x43 hc y56c ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Rachel learned that most of her family had been killed. She wanted to </div><div class="t m488 x43 hc y1d8 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">turn herself in and die, too, but the family who had protected her </div><div class="t m621 x43 hc y622 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">begged her to stay. &quot;If the soldiers learn we have hidden you, we will </div><div class="t m4b2 x43 hc y623 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">die, too.&quot; Rachel remained with this family for several months. </div><div class="t m1e8 x45 hc y1da ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">When travel became safer, Rachel returned to her home village. </div><div class="t m622 x43 hc y1db ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">She stepped off the bus to find that every home in her village had been </div><div class="t m1f3 x43 hc y1dc ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">destroyed. She learned that her father was reading his Bible when an </div><div class="t m623 x43 hc y570 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">enemy with a large knife struck him down. His last word was &quot;Amen&quot; </div><div class="t m1d x43 hc y1de ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">as he fell on top of his Bible. Her mother and a sister, who were not in </div><div class="t m387 x43 hc y981 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the village at the time, were saved. But one of her brothers, who lived </div><div class="t m57f x50 hc y1df ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in a distant village, was singing Sabbath choruses with his two young </div><div class="t m624 x43 hc y982 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sons when they died. </div><div class="t m625 x54 hc y983 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">During the terrible days of civil war in Rwanda more than 1 million </div><div class="t m626 x50 hc y75b ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">people were killed, including some 20,000 on the Adventist university </div><div class="t m627 x50 hc y984 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">campus where they had sought refuge. During those discouraging days </div><div class="t m628 x50 hc y440 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Rachel sometimes became overwhelmed with sorrow. How could she </div><div class="t m383 x50 hc y69a ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">serve a God who allowed so many to die? Then she recalled her </div><div class="t m11 x50 hc y985 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">promise to her father that she would always be faithful to Jesus. &quot;I </div><div class="t m629 x50 hc y60f ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">know that I will meet them again,&quot; she said. &quot;I have forgiven the men </div><div class="t m62a x50 hc y546 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">who killed my family. I do not want hatred to keep me out of heaven.&quot; </div><div class="t m62b x54 hc y547 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Rachel returned to school and completed her theology training.
