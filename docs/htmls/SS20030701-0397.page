Then he ordered the Tutsis to move to one side. </div><div class="t m1d4 x44 he y569 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Rachel stepped from the line and joined the second group. A man </div><div class="t m51a x44 he y465 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">carrying a weapon walked down the line telling the students, &quot;You&apos;d </div><div class="t m61b x44 he y1cf ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">better pray; in ten minutes you will be dead.&quot; </div><div class="t m61c x47 he y467 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">As the killer reached the far end of the line, someone pulled Rachel </div><div class="t m223 x44 he y56a ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">from the line and pushed her toward some bushes to hide. She was </div><div class="t m178 x44 he y507 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">spared. Several more times in the days ahead Rachel escaped death </div><div class="t m26c x44 he y1d3 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">when those around her were killed. </div><div class="t m61d xb2 he y1d3 ff6 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Why me? </div><div class="t m61e x33 he y1d3 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">she wondered. </div><div class="t m61e x47 he y469 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Some students fled to another city where they thought they would </div><div class="t m61f x44 he y1d5 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">he safe. But they soon learned that there was no safe place. However, </div><div class="t m23b x44 he y56b ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">again and again the handful of students were spared certain death. </div><div class="t m61d x46 he y1d7 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">A family took her into their home and hid her. While she was there, </div><div class="t m620 x44 he y56d ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Rachel learned that most of her family had been killed. She wanted to </div><div class="t m488 x44 he y1d9 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">turn herself in and die, too, but the family who had protected her </div><div class="t m621 x44 he y623 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">begged her to stay. &quot;If the soldiers learn we have hidden you, we will </div><div class="t m4b2 x44 he y624 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">die, too.&quot; Rachel remained with this family for several months. </div><div class="t m1e8 x46 he y1db ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">When travel became safer, Rachel returned to her home village. </div><div class="t m622 x44 he y1dc ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">She stepped off the bus to find that every home in her village had been </div><div class="t m1f3 x44 he y1dd ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">destroyed. She learned that her father was reading his Bible when an </div><div class="t m623 x44 he y571 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">enemy with a large knife struck him down. His last word was &quot;Amen&quot; </div><div class="t m1d x44 he y1df ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">as he fell on top of his Bible. Her mother and a sister, who were not in </div><div class="t m387 x44 he y982 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the village at the time, were saved. But one of her brothers, who lived </div><div class="t m57f x51 he y1e0 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in a distant village, was singing Sabbath choruses with his two young </div><div class="t m624 x44 he y983 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sons when they died. </div><div class="t m625 x55 he y984 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">During the terrible days of civil war in Rwanda more than 1 million </div><div class="t m626 x51 he y75c ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">people were killed, including some 20,000 on the Adventist university </div><div class="t m627 x51 he y985 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">campus where they had sought refuge. During those discouraging days </div><div class="t m628 x51 he y441 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Rachel sometimes became overwhelmed with sorrow. How could she </div><div class="t m383 x51 he y69b ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">serve a God who allowed so many to die? Then she recalled her </div><div class="t m11 x51 he y986 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">promise to her father that she would always be faithful to Jesus. &quot;I </div><div class="t m629 x51 he y610 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">know that I will meet them again,&quot; she said. &quot;I have forgiven the men </div><div class="t m62a x51 he y547 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">who killed my family. I do not want hatred to keep me out of heaven.&quot; </div><div class="t m62b x55 he y548 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Rachel returned to school and completed her theology training.
