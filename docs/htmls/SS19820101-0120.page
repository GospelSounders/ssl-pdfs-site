The fact that we all have a conscience does not mean that </div><div class="t m321 x97 h19 y300 ff6 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">we all have the same evaluations of right and wrong (which are </div><div class="t m322 x97 h19 y301 ff6 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">influenced by our concept of what is good and what is bad). As some have </div><div class="t m323 x97 h19 y302 ff6 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">suggested, law is essentially an aspect of culture. Men&apos;s concepts of </div><div class="t mfd x97 h19 y303 ff6 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">good or bad are largely nurtured by cultural backgrounds. </div><div class="t m324 x31 h19 y304 ff6 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Because circumstances and cultures differ, human law is somewhat </div><div class="t m10f x97 h19 y305 ff6 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">relative. For example, in severe weather conditions, when food </div><div class="t m159 x97 h19 y306 ff6 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">supply is low, the permitting of infants or the aged to die is acceptable </div><div class="t m325 x97 h19 y307 ff6 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">among some peoples. </div><div class="t m326 x31 h19 y308 ff6 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">As behavior permissible by law may differ widely, so with standards </div><div class="t m2c6 x97 h19 y309 ff6 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of goodness, unless tied to divine law and instruction.

Some argue that it differs little from </div><div class="t m32a x9d h19 y30d ff6 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">giving tips to a taxi driver, a barber, or a waitress in the restaurant. If </div><div class="t m32b x9d h19 y30e ff6 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">small tips are sanctioned by the government, when and why do &quot;bigger </div><div class="t m32c x9d h19 y30f ff6 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tips&quot; become corruption? In the area of fashions, there are other </div><div class="t m32d x9d h19 y310 ff6 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">issues.

The sense of appropriateness of a certain standard is </div><div class="t m330 x69 h19 y313 ff6 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">often temporal. </div><div class="t m15d x6c h19 y314 ff6 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">These illustrations show that each person and group has his or </div><div class="t m331 x69 h19 y315 ff6 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">their own set of inward laws which are the result of culture, education, </div><div class="t m332 x69 h19 y316 ff6 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">socioeconomic status, occupation, age, location, religion, and a </div><div class="t m1 x69 h19 y317 ff6 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">number of other factors.
