Notice, too, the sequence: Jesus is Creator and Sustainer (vss. 2, </div><div class="t m175 x14 he y166 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">3), and then suddenly He becomes the Savior. </div><div class="t m176 x49 hd y167 ff5 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Which words specifically talk about the Cross in these four </div><div class="t m177 x30 hd y168 ff5 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">texts?
