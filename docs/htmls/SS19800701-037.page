This is the first time that Job </div><div class="t ma5 x21 h14 y9d ff5 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">has been studied in the Sabbath School lessons.

For this reason it is highly recommended </div><div class="t mac x21 h14 ya3 ff5 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that the student have access to a modern speech translation. The Revised Standard </div><div class="t mad x21 h14 ya4 ff5 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Version is very helpful.
