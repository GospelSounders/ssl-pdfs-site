But the villagers threatened </div><div class="t m692 x59 h29 y92f ff6 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to kill any Adventist who entered. How could Kumah ask two </div><div class="t m693 x59 h29 y930 ff6 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">pioneers to risk their lives on such a dangerous assignment? Then </div><div class="t m105 x59 h29 y931 ff6 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">he realized that while the villagers might kill a man, they would </div><div class="t m5b5 x59 h29 y932 ff6 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">not harm a woman! He asked Yinina and Sarah to go. </div><div class="t m694 x58 h29 y933 ff6 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Trembling, the women finally agreed to go. They took a bus to the </div><div class="t m695 x59 h29 y934 ff6 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">village. But heavy storms made the road impassible, and the women </div><div class="t m696 x59 h29 y935 ff6 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">had to walk the last few miles, carrying their heavy luggage. </div><div class="t m697 x4f h29 y936 ff6 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">As they approached the village, a crowd gathered. Frangky, the </div><div class="t m254 x59 h29 y937 ff6 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">leader of the village youth, blocked the path and loudly told the </div><div class="t m50 x59 h29 y938 ff6 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">women, &quot;If you were men, you would have one minute to leave.&quot; </div><div class="t m697 x4f h29 y4e ff6 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The women bowed their heads and prayed, then started singing </div><div class="t m277 x59 h29 y939 ff6 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">a song of praise to God. The villagers were charmed by the music. </div><div class="t m564 x50 h29 y93a ff6 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Scowls turned to smiles. Even Frangky hummed along. </div><div class="t m21e x4f h29 y93b ff6 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The villagers let the women stay in a large house in the center of </div><div class="t m41 x59 h29 y93c ff6 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the village. They offered to teach the villagers to sing their songs. </div><div class="t m118 x50 h29 y93d ff6 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Even Frangky joined the singers. But the daughter of the region&apos;s </div><div class="t m48b x50 h29 y93e ff6 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">king demanded that her father force the women to leave the large </div><div class="t m57e x50 h29 y93f ff6 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">house. The women found themselves living in a tiny crowded hut. </div><div class="t m55c x4f h29 y940 ff6 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">About a week later this woman&apos;s son died in an accident. She </div><div class="t m698 x50 h29 y941 ff6 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was crushed and convinced that God was punishing her for driving </div><div class="t mde x50 h29 y942 ff6 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the women from the large house. She begged their forgiveness and </div><div class="t m5de x50 h29 y943 ff6 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">urged the villagers to listen to them. </div><div class="t m360 x4f h29 y944 ff6 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Often when the villagers sang, Tarsan, a village dog, howled </div><div class="t m425 x50 h29 y945 ff6 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">along. The villagers said that the dog was praising God. </div><div class="t m62d x4f h29 y946 ff6 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Frangky joined the women&apos;s Bible study group and eventually </div><div class="t m1f9 x50 h29 y947 ff6 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">decided to be baptized.
