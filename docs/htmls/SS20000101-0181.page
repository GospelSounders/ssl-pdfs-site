But the villagers threatened </div><div class="t m692 x5a h2c y930 ff6 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to kill any Adventist who entered. How could Kumah ask two </div><div class="t m693 x5a h2c y931 ff6 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">pioneers to risk their lives on such a dangerous assignment? Then </div><div class="t m105 x5a h2c y932 ff6 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">he realized that while the villagers might kill a man, they would </div><div class="t m5b5 x5a h2c y933 ff6 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">not harm a woman! He asked Yinina and Sarah to go. </div><div class="t m694 x59 h2c y934 ff6 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Trembling, the women finally agreed to go. They took a bus to the </div><div class="t m695 x5a h2c y935 ff6 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">village. But heavy storms made the road impassible, and the women </div><div class="t m696 x5a h2c y936 ff6 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">had to walk the last few miles, carrying their heavy luggage. </div><div class="t m697 x50 h2c y937 ff6 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">As they approached the village, a crowd gathered. Frangky, the </div><div class="t m254 x5a h2c y938 ff6 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">leader of the village youth, blocked the path and loudly told the </div><div class="t m50 x5a h2c y939 ff6 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">women, &quot;If you were men, you would have one minute to leave.&quot; </div><div class="t m697 x50 h2c y4f ff6 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The women bowed their heads and prayed, then started singing </div><div class="t m277 x5a h2c y93a ff6 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">a song of praise to God. The villagers were charmed by the music. </div><div class="t m564 x51 h2c y93b ff6 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Scowls turned to smiles. Even Frangky hummed along. </div><div class="t m21e x50 h2c y93c ff6 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The villagers let the women stay in a large house in the center of </div><div class="t m41 x5a h2c y93d ff6 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the village. They offered to teach the villagers to sing their songs. </div><div class="t m118 x51 h2c y93e ff6 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Even Frangky joined the singers. But the daughter of the region&apos;s </div><div class="t m48b x51 h2c y93f ff6 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">king demanded that her father force the women to leave the large </div><div class="t m57e x51 h2c y940 ff6 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">house. The women found themselves living in a tiny crowded hut. </div><div class="t m55c x50 h2c y941 ff6 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">About a week later this woman&apos;s son died in an accident. She </div><div class="t m698 x51 h2c y942 ff6 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was crushed and convinced that God was punishing her for driving </div><div class="t mde x51 h2c y943 ff6 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the women from the large house. She begged their forgiveness and </div><div class="t m5de x51 h2c y944 ff6 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">urged the villagers to listen to them. </div><div class="t m360 x50 h2c y945 ff6 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Often when the villagers sang, Tarsan, a village dog, howled </div><div class="t m425 x51 h2c y946 ff6 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">along. The villagers said that the dog was praising God. </div><div class="t m62d x50 h2c y947 ff6 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Frangky joined the women&apos;s Bible study group and eventually </div><div class="t m1f9 x51 h2c y948 ff6 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">decided to be baptized.
