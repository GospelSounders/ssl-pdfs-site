Do they praise God? </div><div class="t m311 x2 h17 y6b9 ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Psalms 6:5; 115:17. </div><div class="t m58b x5e h15 y43b ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The Bible teaches that the dead are sleeping, without any awareness of </div><div class="t m513 x2 h15 y9fb ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">what is happening on earth or in heaven. They do not praise God because </div><div class="t m61 x2 h15 y9fc ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">they cannot. If the good were in heaven immediately after death, wouldn&apos;t </div><div class="t m37b x2 h15 y9fd ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">they praise the Lord? </div><div class="t m28 x5e h15 y43e ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The parable of the rich man and </div><div class="t m5db x88 h17 y9fe ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I </div><div class="t m503 x94 h15 y9fe ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0"> .a7arus (Luke 16:19-31) is often used as </div><div class="t m24 x2 h15 y86c ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">evidence of life in either heaven or hell immediately after death. The parable </div><div class="t m49e x2 h15 y9ff ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">is simply designed to teach the danger of covetousness. It offers no support </div><div class="t m3f5 x2 h15 ya00 ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">for the doctrine of the immortality of the soul. If the parable is interpreted </div><div class="t m4e7 x2 h15 y92c ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">literally it becomes an absurdity. </div><div class="t m4db x5e h15 y86e ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">For example, the beggar went to &quot;Abraham&apos;s bosom.&quot; Obviously that is a </div><div class="t m3af x2 h15 y9d9 ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">symbol. Abraham would have needed a very large chest to literally accom-</div><div class="t m5dc x2 h15 ya01 ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">modate all the righteous dead. The rich man in hell spoke of Lazarus&apos; finger, </div><div class="t m3f2 x2 h15 ya02 ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and his own tongue. In this parable the dead have bodies. But immortal soul </div><div class="t m45e x2 h15 ya03 ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">advocates believe that the souls of the dead are disembodied. Who imagines </div><div class="t m29a x2 h15 y6bf ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that it is possible for the good in heaven to converse with the wicked in hell, </div><div class="t m49d x2 h15 ya04 ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">as they do in this parable? The rich man wanted Lazarus to go to his living </div><div class="t m58a x2 h15 y9dd ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">brothers and warn them. The only way that could happen, accordingto this </div><div class="t m489 x2 h15 ya05 ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">story, would be if &quot;one rose from the dead&quot; (Luke 16:31). That is quite </div><div class="t m3ee x2 h15 ya06 ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">different from the popular idea that dead souls can communicate with the </div><div class="t m11a x2 h15 y2dc ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">living without a resurrection being necessary. </div><div class="t m5dd x5e h15 y779 ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Jesus was using a popular fable as a sermon illustration. He was not teach-</div><div class="t m2ff x2 h15 y77a ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ing life immediately after death, or the doctrine of the immortality of the </div><div class="t m123 x2 h15 ya07 ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">soul.
