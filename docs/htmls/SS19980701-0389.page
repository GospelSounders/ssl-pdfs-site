Even today, several years after the power of </div><div class="t m4ec x18 hd y28f ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Communism was broken, one seldom sees a smile on the streets. A </div><div class="t m1a8 x18 hd y418 ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sense of gloom and hopelessness pervades the faces. </div><div class="t m1bb x4b hd y290 ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">When Global Mission Pioneers began working in Neftekamsk, </div><div class="t m13e x18 hd y291 ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">an oil-rich city in Russia, they visited people in their homes, </div><div class="t m19b x18 hd y63f ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">schools, and nursing homes. In one nursing home, where elderly </div><div class="t md9 x18 hd y54e ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">soldiers sat idly in wheelchairs or wasted away in dimly lit rooms, </div><div class="t m2d2 x18 hd y292 ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">they met 17-year-old Anatoli. His mother had died; his alcoholic </div><div class="t m5ad x18 hd y293 ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">father had beaten him several times.

The quiet young man accepted the </div><div class="t m406 x18 hd y550 ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">invitation. After the first meeting Anatoli was so excited that he </div><div class="t m19a x18 hd y298 ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">invited several of his school friends to attend. These youth, who </div><div class="t m2a8 x18 hd y299 ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">had been taught all their lives that there is no God, now heard the </div><div class="t mb7 x2b hd y29a ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Word of God for the first time. </div><div class="t m145 x4b hd y29b ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The Holy Spirit spoke to Anatoli&apos;s heart, and he responded to </div><div class="t m13c x18 hd y29c ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the invitation to follow Jesus.

Anatoli drank in the truth that </div><div class="t m87 x18 hd y1ad ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">one day Jesus will come to take His faithful followers to a place </div><div class="t m47c x2b hd y29f ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">called heaven, where there is no suffering or death.
