Even today, several years after the power of </div><div class="t m4ec x17 hb y28e ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Communism was broken, one seldom sees a smile on the streets.

In one nursing home, where elderly </div><div class="t md9 x17 hb y54d ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">soldiers sat idly in wheelchairs or wasted away in dimly lit rooms, </div><div class="t m2d2 x17 hb y291 ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">they met 17-year-old Anatoli.
