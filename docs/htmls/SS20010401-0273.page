The pastor had been </div><div class="t m601 x4a h11 y797 ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">severely beaten and needed a doctor. </div><div class="t m220 x49 h11 y798 ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The elderly pastor who lived in the area sent a church member by </div><div class="t m602 x4a h11 y799 ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">motorcycle 120 miles to the nearest city. Another church member rode </div><div class="t m603 x4a h11 y79a ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">his bicycle 60 miles to another outpost. </div><div class="t m23e x49 h11 y79b ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">As the sun set that Friday evening, several church members arrived </div><div class="t m604 x4a h11 y41 ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to protect the three missionaries that night. Sabbath morning found </div><div class="t m605 x4a h11 y79c ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">hundreds of believers sitting outside the house. They had heard that </div><div class="t m2ed x4a h11 y79d ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">their new pastor could not attend church, so they had come to pray and </div><div class="t m606 x4a h11 y79e ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sing and study with him. </div><div class="t med x49 h11 y79f ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">A few days later the three workers were evacuated. It was six </div><div class="t m607 x4a h11 y7a0 ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">months before Tania and a doctor could return to the mission to train </div><div class="t maf x4a h11 y7a1 ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">health care workers and midwives and to treat up to 200 patients a day. </div><div class="t m2e7 x49 h11 y7a2 ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Then guerrilla soldiers attacked a neighboring village. Tania and the </div><div class="t m606 x4a h11 y7a3 ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">doctor were warned to leave immediately. Church members hid them </div><div class="t m608 x1c h11 y7a4 ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in their village for protection, while other believers guarded the mis-</div><div class="t m609 x4a h11 yae ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sion hospital. The next day survivors of the attack came for help. Some </div><div class="t m300 x4a h11 y7a5 ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">needed immediate hospital care. As Tania and the doctor prepared to </div><div class="t m60a x4a h11 y7a6 ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">evacuate them, Tania knew that they would not be able to return. </div><div class="t m42f x49 h11 y7a7 ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Tania&apos;s heart was torn. She longed to return and complete the </div><div class="t m60b x1c h11 y7a8 ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">midwife training program, but it was months before the area was safe </div><div class="t m60c x1c h11 y7a9 ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">enough to return. This time she returned alone and for six weeks only. </div><div class="t m60d x1c h11 y7aa ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">She still had no electricity, and often she awoke at night hearing noises. </div><div class="t m60e x1c h11 y7ab ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">But from sunrise to sunset she worked for the people. </div><div class="t m60f x49 h11 y7ac ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The UN troops did not allow her to leave the mission grounds, so </div><div class="t m610 x4a h11 y7ad ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">she prayed that God would bring the midwives to her. And they came. </div><div class="t m610 x1c h11 y7ae ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">As she taught them and cared for the sick, she thought of the good she </div><div class="t m60d x1c h11 y7af ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">could do if she could remain. But when her six weeks ended, she had to </div><div class="t m4da x1c h11 y7b0 ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">leave. As her car drove out of the mission, the midwives she had </div><div class="t m611 x1c h11 y62 ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">trained walked along beside it, bidding her a tearful farewell. </div><div class="t m210 x41 h11 y29 ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Tania is determined to return to Africa </div><div class="t m2d6 x91 h11 y7b1 ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">as a missionary nurse. It is what she has </div><div class="t m612 x4d h11 y7b2 ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">always wanted to do. </div><div class="t m613 x41 h2b y7b3 ff6 fs18 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Tania Batista (left) is preparing to return </div><div class="t m5f x4d h2b y7b4 ff6 fs18 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to the mission field.
