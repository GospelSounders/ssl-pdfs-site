The cough often </div><div class="t m11c x1c hd y2fc ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">kept her awake at night and left her too weak to attend school.

Suddenly she awoke </div><div class="t m11e x1c hd y306 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and found the table in flames and the room filled with smoke. </div><div class="t m2e1 x1d hd y273 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Mavis and her brother jumped through the flames to safety. </div><div class="t m2e2 x1c hd y307 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Their shouts brought help, and the fire was soon out, but the room </div><div class="t m2b4 x1c hd y2a8 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and its contents were destroyed, including Mavis&apos;s study notes. </div><div class="t m2e3 x1d hd y274 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">When her friends learned what had happened, they shared their </div><div class="t m2e4 x1c hd y275 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">notes with Mavis so she could prepare for her exams.
