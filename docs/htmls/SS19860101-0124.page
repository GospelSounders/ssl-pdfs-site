Enlightenment is the process whereby a </div><div class="t m3e9 x5b hd y3cc ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">person appreciates the true value of that which has been revealed. It is </div><div class="t m3ea x5b hd y3cd ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">somewhat like a person finding a rare coin in the change received during a </div><div class="t m3eb x5b hd y3ce ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">business transaction.

But there </div><div class="t m3ed x5b hd y3d1 ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">are those who perceive and treasure God&apos;s revelations. </div><div class="t m2ef x26 hd y3d2 ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;All who believe with the heart the word of God will hunger and thirst </div><div class="t m3ee x5b hd y3d3 ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">for a knowledge of His will.

The Prayer for the Expected Results: Hope, Heavenly Riches, and </div><div class="t m3f1 x58 he y3da ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Power (Eph. 1:18, 19). </div><div class="t m3f2 x26 hd y3db ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The unconverted human being probably would reverse the order; wish-</div><div class="t m3f3 x58 hd y3dc ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ing for power first, riches second, and hope third. But, even at that, the </div><div class="t m3f4 x58 hd y3dd ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">person involved would misunderstand this concept because the riches it </div><div class="t m54 x58 hd y3de ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">talks about are not associated with the glitter of gold or the value of mate-</div><div class="t m3f5 x58 hd y3df ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">rial things. The &quot;riches&quot; Paul speaks about involve the inheritance </div><div class="t m22 x58 hd y3e0 ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">awaiting each Christian. They are &quot;the riches of his glorious inheritance </div><div class="t m34e x58 hd y208 ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in the saints&quot; (Eph. 1:18, RSV). Nothing on earth can compare with the </div><div class="t m3f6 x58 hd y3e1 ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">inheritance awaiting us. If there were anything earthly having more glory </div><div class="t m32a x58 hd y3e2 ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">than what our future riches hold, then it might be understandable why we </div><div class="t m18f x58 hd y3e3 ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">would set our affections on that earthly object. </div><div class="t m184 x58 he y3e4 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">What does Paul mean when he refers to &quot;the hope of his calling&quot;? Verse 18. </div><div class="t m154 x26 hd y3e5 ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Some commentators believe that in this . . . passage Paul refers, not to </div><div class="t m3f7 x58 hd y3e6 ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the thing hoped for, but to the principle of hope in the life that is inspired </div><div class="t m3f8 x58 hd y3e7 ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">by the divine calling. To have that hope is to have something precious </div><div class="t m3f9 x58 hd y3e8 ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">beyond measure. Paul&apos;s readers still did not comprehend the full meaning </div><div class="t m264 x58 hd y3e9 ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of their calling, and he was anxious that they should see that the Chris-</div><div class="t m3fa x58 hd y3ea ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tian&apos;s hope is based on the facts of redemption. . . . They had forgiveness </div><div class="t m3fb x58 hd y3eb ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of sins, they were children of God, but still their eyes were holden. He </div><div class="t m3fc x58 hd y3ec ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">wanted them to have the hope that would suggest to them more than they </div><div class="t m3b x58 hd y3ed ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">had-dreamed of.
