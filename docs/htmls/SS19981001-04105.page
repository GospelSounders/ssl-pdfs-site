In 1992 he returned to Mari, taking 50 Bibles with him. </div><div class="t mf9 x60 hc y8c6 ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">When he arrived he discovered that not one home had a Bible! He </div><div class="t m5e7 x60 hc y3bd ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">traveled to Bucharest to buy 105 more Bibles, so each home would </div><div class="t m6d6 x59 hc y8c7 ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">have one. </div><div class="t m2a0 x35 hc y8c8 ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">While in Mari, two men from Veda, a neighboring village, </div><div class="t m274 x59 hc y8c9 ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">came to see Butoy. &quot;Please bring Bibles to our village too,&quot; they </div><div class="t m501 x60 hc y8ca ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">pleaded. Butoy promised to help them, but he had no more money. </div><div class="t mf8 x35 hc y8cb ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">He returned to California, praying that God would answer the </div><div class="t m461 x59 hc y8cc ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">prayers of these spiritually hungry people. He visited two of his </div><div class="t mf8 x59 hc y8cd ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">cousins whose ancestral home was Veda and challenged them to </div><div class="t m37 x59 hc y8ce ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">help provide Bibles for their village. A few months later Butoy and </div><div class="t m469 x59 hc y8cf ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">his cousins returned to Veda with Bibles for every family. </div><div class="t m5e1 x3a hc y8d0 ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">While visiting the homes, they met the Orthodox priest. He </div><div class="t m565 x59 hc y8d1 ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">thanked the men for providing the Bibles. &quot;I cannot attend your </div><div class="t m2dd x59 hc y8d2 ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">meetings,&quot; he said. &quot;But I encourage my people to attend. It is all </div><div class="t m163 x59 hc y8d3 ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">right with me if half of the town becomes Adventists!&quot; the priest </div><div class="t m290 x59 hc y8d4 ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">told his surprised visitors. </div><div class="t m164 x3a hc y8d5 ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Butoy wanted to provide Bibles for six additional villages in </div><div class="t m562 x59 hc y8d6 ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Romania. He asked The Quiet Hour and several churches to help </div><div class="t m348 x59 hc y8d7 ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">him provide 2,500 Bibles. </div><div class="t m32e x3a hc y8d8 ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Then some of the people who had received Bibles asked for </div><div class="t m1ea x59 hc y8d9 ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">help to understand the Word of God better. But Butoy had no </div><div class="t m4e8 x59 hc y8da ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">money to support lay Bible teachers in the villages. Again he asked </div><div class="t me4 x59 hc y8db ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">God to provide for this outreach. </div><div class="t m45e x3a hc y8dc ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Butoy saw his three apricot trees in full bloom. He knelt under </div><div class="t m6d7 x18 hc y8dd ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">one of the trees and dedicated it to the Lord. &quot;I will sell the apricots </div><div class="t m560 x18 hc y8de ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">from this tree to finance lay workers in Romania,&quot; he promised </div><div class="t m1fa x18 hc y866 ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">God. The apricot tree he had dedicated to God produced twice as </div><div class="t m45d x18 hc y8df ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">much fruit as the other two trees.
