H. Zachary </div><div class="t me0 x31 hb y1db ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">During late 1996 and early 1997 nearly sixty Protestant pastors </div><div class="t m1ef x4a hb y1dc ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in eastern India were baptized into the Adventist Church. But </div><div class="t m1f0 x4a hb y44 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">many wondered if they would be faithful to the new Bible truths </div><div class="t m1f1 x4a hb y1dd ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">they had accepted. Recently I heard some of these pastors share </div><div class="t m1f2 x4a hb y1de ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">how God is working in their lives. Let me introduce a few of them. </div><div class="t m1f3 x21 hb y1df ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Pastor P. Ponda is a third-generation pastor. He was leading </div><div class="t m10c x4a hb y1e0 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">30 independent congregations when he met some Adventist pas-</div><div class="t m1f4 x4a hb y1e1 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tors. As the pastors discussed Bible truths, Pastor Ponda began to </div><div class="t m1f5 xb hb y1e2 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">understand the Bible basis for Adventist teachings. He requested </div><div class="t m9d xb hb y1e3 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">baptism. &quot;I want the Adventist Church to shepherd my nearly </div><div class="t m1f6 xb hb y1e4 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">four thousand people,&quot; he said. To date, nearly half of his mem-</div><div class="t m1f7 xb hb y1e5 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">bers have been baptized. </div><div class="t m1f8 x21 hb y1e6 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">When Assish Missal completed his seminary training, he felt a </div><div class="t m14a xb hb y1e7 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">burden to reach the tribal people living in the mountains near his </div><div class="t m1f9 xb hb y1e8 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">home. Then he attended a revival meeting conducted by Adventist </div><div class="t m1fa xb hb y1e9 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">evangelist Bhasker Rao. As he understood and accepted the Bible </div><div class="t m13b xb hb y1ea ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">basis for Adventist teachings, he requested rebaptism. When </div><div class="t m1fb xb hb y1eb ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">word of his conversion reached his home town, he was expelled </div><div class="t m1fc xb hb y1ec ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">from the village and church officials canceled plans for a village </div><div class="t m1fd xb hb y1ed ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">marriage for his sister. Undaunted, Missal has formed three </div><div class="t m1fe xb hb y1ee ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Adventist congregations in his community. </div><div class="t m1c3 x21 hb y1ef ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Absalom Maik was a priest before he accepted the Sabbath </div><div class="t m1ff xb hb y1f0 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">message and was baptized. He became a lay preacher. An angry </div><div class="t m200 xb hb y1f1 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">crowd surrounded his family&apos;s house and threatened to take his </div><div class="t m12a xb hb y1f2 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">life, but Maik&apos;s brother persuaded the mob to leave. However, </div><div class="t m201 xb hb y1f3 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Maik was excommunicated from the village and is not permitted </div><div class="t m71 xb hb y1f4 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">even to draw water from the village well. His converts have lost </div><div class="t m202 xb hb y1f5 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the privilege of being buried in the village graveyard. But Maik </div><div class="t m203 xb hb y1f6 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">continues to witness. Within a year Brother Maik had prepared </div><div class="t m204 x4e hb y1f7 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">120 persons for baptism. </div><div class="t m205 x22 hb y1f8 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Pastor Vijaha Lima attended </div><div class="t m206 x62 hb y1f8 ff6 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The Quiet Hour </div><div class="t m207 x69 hb y1f8 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">revival and was </div><div class="t m208 x4e hb y1f9 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">baptized. He went from home to home in his village, sharing the </div><div class="t m11d x4e hb y1fa ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Bible-based teachings he had learned. Eighty persons accepted </div><div class="t m209 x4e hb y1fb ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the truth and requested baptism. The new believers were told to </div><div class="t m86 x4e hb y1fc ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">leave the village. When one of the believers died, the village </div><div class="t m62 x4e hb y1fd ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">refused to allow the Adventists to bury him in the village cem-</div><div class="t m204 x4e hb y1fe ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">etery.
