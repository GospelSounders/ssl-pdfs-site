Exod. 34:6, 7. </div><div class="t m38d xb7 h1c y353 ff7 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">God&apos;s justice demands that the transgressor pay the penalty of </div><div class="t m57f x34 h1c y418 ff7 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">transgression. Death is that penalty. So if justice alone were to prevail, </div><div class="t m5eb x34 h1c y144 ff7 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">all of us would die, for all of us have sinned.

His mercy makes it possible for the condemned sinner to </div><div class="t m45b x34 h1c y145 ff7 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">live. God, in Jesus, paid the penalty for all who repent of their sins and </div><div class="t m4d9 x34 h1c y651 ff7 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">accept Jesus as their Substitute. God&apos;s mercy is great. But His justice </div><div class="t m2d7 x34 h1c y146 ff7 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">is real. If we refuse to accept the provisions made for our salvation, </div><div class="t m372 x34 h1c y356 ff7 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">then we will have to face full justice. </div><div class="t m271 x2d h2b y745 ff6 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">What truth points out the mercy of God? Rom. 5:8. </div><div class="t m5ed x2d h1c y25f ff7 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Let us suppose that the richest and most generous person on earth </div><div class="t m5ee x34 h1c y358 ff7 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">set up a trust fund with the simple provision that any person who </div><div class="t m50f x34 h1c y1cf ff7 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">wrote and asked could have $10,000.
