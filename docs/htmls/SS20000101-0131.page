After graduation he worked as a lay pastor, caring </div><div class="t m3d1 x5a h2c y441 ff6 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">for 12 congregations in the mountains. Riding a bicycle, he could meet </div><div class="t m31f x5a h2c y442 ff6 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">with three congregations each Sabbath. During the week he met with </div><div class="t m25e x5a h2c y443 ff6 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">lay leaders of the congregations.
