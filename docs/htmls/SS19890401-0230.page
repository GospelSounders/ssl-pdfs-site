The problem with the members </div><div class="t m308 x41 h6 y3c4 ff4 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in Sardis was that they had lost the presence of Jesus in their hearts. </div><div class="t m36 x59 h14 y473 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">When is imperfection sin? </div><div class="t m1a1 x7e h6 y474 ff4 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Not all imperfection is counted by God to </div><div class="t m2ac x41 h6 y277 ff4 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">be sin.

The imperfect works of the people were not regarded as </div><div class="t mc1 x41 h6 y36a ff4 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sin until they had received the light from Jesus. Paul taught that &quot;whatever </div><div class="t m1cc x41 h6 y36b ff4 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">does not proceed from faith is sin&quot; (Rom. 14:23, RSV).

The house was a </div><div class="t m33d x41 h6 y485 ff4 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">genuine work of heart. Another man who was a building contractor </div><div class="t m33e x41 h6 y486 ff4 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">deliberately put inferior materials into the foundations of a house.
