Read Luke 11:5-8. </div><div class="t m4ef x14 h26 y6a3 ff3 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Several customs are apparent in these verses: (1) During hot weather, </div><div class="t m3f3 x14 h26 y6a4 ff3 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">people often traveled at night. This could explain the midnight hour. </div><div class="t m4f0 x14 h26 y1a4 ff3 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">(2) Hospitality was a sacred duty. But because just enough bread was </div><div class="t m4f1 x14 h26 y1a5 ff3 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">baked in the morning for one day&apos;s use, the friend could not fulfill this </div><div class="t m3a x14 h26 y1a6 ff3 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">duty. Thus he was faced with quite a predicament. (3) Doors were </div><div class="t m139 x14 h26 y6a5 ff3 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">usually left open during the day. But closing them in the evening </div><div class="t m3f5 x14 h26 y1a8 ff3 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">signaled the householder&apos;s desire not to be disturbed. Thus, it was </div><div class="t m4f2 x14 h26 y1a9 ff3 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">considered quite rude to knock on a closed door, unless the need was </div><div class="t m4f3 x14 h26 y1aa ff3 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">crucial. (4) A Palestinian house was usually divided into two parts by </div><div class="t m4f4 x14 h26 y1ab ff3 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">a low platform that comprised about one-third of the floor space. On </div><div class="t m4f5 x14 h26 y6a6 ff3 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the platform sat a charcoal stove around which the entire family slept </div><div class="t m4e8 x14 h26 y6a7 ff3 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">on mats. If one person arose, it was likely that others would be </div><div class="t m4f6 x14 h26 y1ae ff3 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">disturbed.

Luke 11:5-13. </div><div class="t m19b x19 h26 y6ab ff3 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Christ is not saying that God is one from whom we must wring a </div><div class="t m259 x14 h26 y4b1 ff3 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">blessing. Instead, He is </div><div class="t m4f7 x63 h26 yb3 ff7 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">contrasting </div><div class="t m24a x6d h26 yb3 ff3 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the householder with our heavenly </div><div class="t mde x14 h26 y6ac ff3 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Father.
