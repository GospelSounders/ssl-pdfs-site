Read Luke 11:5-8. </div><div class="t m4ef x15 h2b y6a4 ff3 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Several customs are apparent in these verses: (1) During hot weather, </div><div class="t m3f3 x15 h2b y6a5 ff3 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">people often traveled at night. This could explain the midnight hour. </div><div class="t m4f0 x15 h2b y1a5 ff3 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">(2) Hospitality was a sacred duty. But because just enough bread was </div><div class="t m4f1 x15 h2b y1a6 ff3 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">baked in the morning for one day&apos;s use, the friend could not fulfill this </div><div class="t m3a x15 h2b y1a7 ff3 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">duty. Thus he was faced with quite a predicament. (3) Doors were </div><div class="t m139 x15 h2b y6a6 ff3 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">usually left open during the day. But closing them in the evening </div><div class="t m3f5 x15 h2b y1a9 ff3 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">signaled the householder&apos;s desire not to be disturbed. Thus, it was </div><div class="t m4f2 x15 h2b y1aa ff3 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">considered quite rude to knock on a closed door, unless the need was </div><div class="t m4f3 x15 h2b y1ab ff3 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">crucial. (4) A Palestinian house was usually divided into two parts by </div><div class="t m4f4 x15 h2b y1ac ff3 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">a low platform that comprised about one-third of the floor space. On </div><div class="t m4f5 x15 h2b y6a7 ff3 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the platform sat a charcoal stove around which the entire family slept </div><div class="t m4e8 x15 h2b y6a8 ff3 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">on mats. If one person arose, it was likely that others would be </div><div class="t m4f6 x15 h2b y1af ff3 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">disturbed.
