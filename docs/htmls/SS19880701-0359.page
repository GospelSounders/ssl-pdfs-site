THE COSMIC ISSUE. </div><div class="t mca x60 h1e y79d ff5 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The issue in the cosmic conflict is explained in Scripture as follows. Sin, </div><div class="t m27c x4e h1e y79e ff5 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">or rebellion, is &quot;the transgression of the law,&quot; or as the Greek of 1 John 3:4 </div><div class="t m246 x1a h1e y79f ff5 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">puts it, &quot;lawlessness.&quot; It is rooted in rejection of God, His government, and </div><div class="t m24c x1a h1e y7a0 ff5 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">His laws that are designed to protect and bless us. Rather than taking the </div><div class="t mad x4e h1e y7a1 ff5 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">blame for lawlessness, Satan tries to blame God for giving His law. He </div><div class="t m23d x1a h1e y7a2 ff5 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">challenges the laws of God as being arbitrary, not in the best interests of </div><div class="t m3db x1a h1e y7a3 ff5 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">created beings, and impossible to keep. This issue is at the center of the </div><div class="t m1e7 x1a h1e y7a4 ff5 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">cosmic controversy. God&apos;s law is as eternal as He is and represents His </div><div class="t m154 x1a h1e y7a5 ff5 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">character. Those who oppose God&apos;s law really oppose God. (See Matt. </div><div class="t m3ac x1a h1e y7a6 ff5 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">5:17-19; 1 John 2:3-6.) </div><div class="t m534 x47 h1e y7a7 ff5 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Insight into this issue is found throughout the Bible. Take the Gospels, for </div><div class="t m167 x1a h1e y7a8 ff5 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">example. In them we read how Christ and Satan came face to face. Satan </div><div class="t m2ac x1a h1e y7a9 ff5 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">invited Christ, after His forty days&apos; fast, to change stones into bread in order </div><div class="t m361 x1a h1e y7aa ff5 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to satisfy His hunger. Christ replied: &quot;Man does not live on bread alone, but </div><div class="t m3b3 x1a h1e y7ab ff5 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">on every word that comes from the mouth of God&quot; (Matt. 4:4, NIV). As He </div><div class="t m61 x1a h1e y7ac ff5 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">did with Eve in Eden, Satan was urging Christ to take His own initiative—to </div><div class="t m31c x1a h1e y7ad ff5 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">make His own decision, and not to depend on God&apos;s word and will. Christ </div><div class="t mc1 x1a h1e y7ae ff5 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">upheld God&apos;s word in every act of His life. </div><div class="t m3bf x1a h1d y7af ff6 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">IN-DEPTH BIBLE STUDY: Read Revelation 12 in more than one Bible </div><div class="t m530 x1a h1d y7b0 ff6 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">version, then match the symbols that follow with their most appropriate </div><div class="t m388 x1a h1d y7b1 ff6 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">fulfillment: </div><div class="t m8b x4 h1e y7b2 ff5 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0"></div><div class="t mc7 x2d h1e y7b2 ff5 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The woman </div><div class="t m8b x5b h1e y7b3 ff5 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0"></div><div class="t m203 x6 h1e y7b4 ff5 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">a.
