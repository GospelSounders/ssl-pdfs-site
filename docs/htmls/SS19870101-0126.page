The Dream Revealed (Dan. 2:24-45). </div><div class="t me4 x5b h1e y34f ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">We can pray, but we cannot decide for God when and how our prayers should </div><div class="t m253 x1b h1e y397 ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">be answered. True prayer is not trying to force our will on God. It is letting Him </div><div class="t mee x1b h1e y398 ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">know what we perceive as our needs. As children ask their parents for things that </div><div class="t m2e4 x1b h1e y399 ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">they think they need, so we as Christians can approach the throne of grace and </div><div class="t m2e5 x39 h1e y39a ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">present our requests. But we must leave it to God to decide when and what to </div><div class="t m2e6 x1b h1e y39b ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">give. In the case of Daniel and his companions the answer came immediately. In </div><div class="t m2c1 x1b h1e y39c ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">some cases answers come before we ask. (See Isa. 65:24.) In all cases, they </div><div class="t m195 x1b h1e y39d ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">come according to God&apos;s will and what He knows is best for us. </div><div class="t m259 x31 h1f y39e ff1 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">How is human nature demonstrated in Arioch&apos;s claim to have &quot;found&quot; </div><div class="t m1ea x1b h1f y39f ff1 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Daniel? Dan. 2:25. </div><div class="t m2e7 x31 h1e y3a0 ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Arioch showed a very human trait, that of claiming all the credit possible to </div><div class="t m2e8 x1b h1e y3a1 ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">oneself. The fact is that Arioch had not &quot;found&quot; Daniel; Daniel had come to him </div><div class="t m112 x1b h1e y83 ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">first. </div><div class="t m13c x31 h1f y3a2 ff1 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">How did Daniel respond to the king&apos;s inquiry as to whether he knew the </div><div class="t m1b0 x1b h1f y3a3 ff1 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">dream and its interpretation? Dan. 2:26, 27. </div><div class="t m2e9 x31 h1e y179 ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">In contrast to Arioch&apos;s self-serving claim, Daniel made it clear that he could </div><div class="t m25b x1b h1e y3a4 ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">not give the answer on the basis of his own knowledge. In fact, no human being </div><div class="t me3 x1b h1e y3a5 ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">could in his or her own power answer the king&apos;s request. </div><div class="t m2ea x31 h1e y3a6 ff7 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;But there is a God in heaven&quot; </div><div class="t m224 x3a h1e y3a7 ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">(verse 28). Here is the clue; God is the true </div><div class="t m1dd x1b h1e y3a8 ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">source of knowledge. He is different from the gods whom the Babylonians wor-</div><div class="t m233 x1b h1e y3a9 ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">shiped. He is not the God of the Jews only.

Although God in heaven alone knows everything, </div><div class="t m2ed x1b h1e y3ad ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">He communicates with people on earth.

The Babylonians wor-</div><div class="t m13b x20 h1e y387 ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">shiped false gods. The priests who claimed to get answers from their gods were </div><div class="t m2b4 x1b h1e y3b1 ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">not in touch with reality.
