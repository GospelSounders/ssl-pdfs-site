Today we&apos;ll look at a few </div><div class="t m416 x79 hc y47d ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">more, remembering this question: Does the context teach that </div><div class="t mc6 x68 hc y752 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the verse is talking about &quot;the Holy Place,&quot; &quot;the Most Holy Place,&quot; or, </div><div class="t m134 x68 hc y6a0 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">simply, the sanctuary as a whole? </div><div class="t m2f1 x43 hc y43 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">In Hebrews 9:1-7, the author describes the earthly sanctuary and </div><div class="t m49d x68 hc y753 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">its services, both the daily and the yearly, which were only a type, a </div><div class="t m443 x68 hc y5fc ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">shadow, of the heavenly sanctuary and its services. Then, in verse 8, </div><div class="t m551 x68 hc y480 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">he says that the way into &quot;the holiest&quot; didn&apos;t happen while the earthly </div><div class="t m2d4 x68 hc y44c ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sanctuary was still standing.
