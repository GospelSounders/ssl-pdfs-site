When the ship </div><div class="t m174 x4b h10 ya2c ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">stopped in the Canary Islands, the captain announced that the </div><div class="t m158 x6a h10 ya2d ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">passengers could leave the ship and tour the island. But they must </div><div class="t m4ea x6a h10 y81a ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">return at a given time. </div><div class="t m21a x4c h10 ya2e ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The captain said, &quot;When you hear a long blast from the ship&apos;s </div><div class="t m4b7 x6a h10 y88f ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">horn, you have only one hour to return to the ship. One half hour </div><div class="t m201 x6a h10 ya2f ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">later you will hear two blasts. If you are not already on the ship, </div><div class="t m1f8 x6a h10 y890 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">you better start running. The ship will leave promptly, and there is </div><div class="t m40b x6a h10 y8fd ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">no way to know who has not returned.&quot; </div><div class="t m3ef x4c h10 y891 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The passengers streamed down the gangplank. At the appointed </div><div class="t m74d x6a h10 ya30 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">hour, a single long blast echoed across the island. Willison made </div><div class="t m3ea x6a h10 y893 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">his way toward the dock. Thirty minutes later he heard two horn </div><div class="t m79 x6a h10 ya31 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">blasts. He hurried toward the gangplank with the other passengers. </div><div class="t m46e x16 h10 y894 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">He joined the other passengers crowded along the ship&apos;s rail. The </div><div class="t m721 x6a h10 ya32 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ship&apos;s deck trembled as the huge engines roared to life. The crew </div><div class="t m71d x6a h10 y895 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">hauled in the lines that had held the ship in place. Only the gang-</div><div class="t m412 x6a h10 ya33 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">plank remained to be taken up. </div><div class="t m72 x4c h10 y896 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Suddenly they saw in the distance a horse-drawn carriage racing </div><div class="t m799 x6a h10 ya34 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">toward the dock. A man jumped from the carriage and started </div><div class="t m348 x16 h10 ya35 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">running. He reached the gangplank and placed one foot firmly on it </div><div class="t m622 x6a h10 ya36 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and the other on the shore, hoping to prevent the ship from sailing. </div><div class="t m3bc x4c h10 ya37 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The man looked frantic as the ship began to swing slowly away </div><div class="t m99 x16 h10 y899 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">from shore, and the space between the gangplank and land wid-</div><div class="t m107 x16 h10 y829 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ened. But he kept his feet planted. Some folks on shore pulled him </div><div class="t m17d x16 h10 y7d8 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">off the gangplank just in time to prevent an unplanned swim. </div><div class="t m464 x17 h10 y82b ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">They called to the family to get into a small boat anchored </div><div class="t m15d x16 h10 y89a ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">nearby. The tiny boat sped across the water to catch up with the </div><div class="t m4d2 x16 h10 ya38 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ship. It maneuvered around the side to where a door opened just </div><div class="t m256 x16 h10 y89b ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">above sea level, and the family managed to board the ship. </div><div class="t m752 x17 h10 ya39 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Willison finished his story by saying, &quot;That man was the first </div><div class="t m79a x16 h10 y89c ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Seventh-day Adventist I ever met. Later we studied the Bible </div><div class="t m423 x16 h10 ya3a ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">together, and I joined the Adventist Church.
