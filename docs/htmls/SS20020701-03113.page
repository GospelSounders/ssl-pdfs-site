When the ship </div><div class="t m174 x4c h12 ya2d ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">stopped in the Canary Islands, the captain announced that the </div><div class="t m158 x6b h12 ya2e ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">passengers could leave the ship and tour the island. But they must </div><div class="t m4ea x6b h12 y81b ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">return at a given time. </div><div class="t m21a x4d h12 ya2f ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The captain said, &quot;When you hear a long blast from the ship&apos;s </div><div class="t m4b7 x6b h12 y890 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">horn, you have only one hour to return to the ship. One half hour </div><div class="t m201 x6b h12 ya30 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">later you will hear two blasts. If you are not already on the ship, </div><div class="t m1f8 x6b h12 y891 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">you better start running. The ship will leave promptly, and there is </div><div class="t m40b x6b h12 y8fe ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">no way to know who has not returned.&quot; </div><div class="t m3ef x4d h12 y892 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The passengers streamed down the gangplank. At the appointed </div><div class="t m74d x6b h12 ya31 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">hour, a single long blast echoed across the island. Willison made </div><div class="t m3ea x6b h12 y894 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">his way toward the dock. Thirty minutes later he heard two horn </div><div class="t m79 x6b h12 ya32 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">blasts. He hurried toward the gangplank with the other passengers. </div><div class="t m46e x17 h12 y895 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">He joined the other passengers crowded along the ship&apos;s rail. The </div><div class="t m721 x6b h12 ya33 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ship&apos;s deck trembled as the huge engines roared to life. The crew </div><div class="t m71d x6b h12 y896 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">hauled in the lines that had held the ship in place. Only the gang-</div><div class="t m412 x6b h12 ya34 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">plank remained to be taken up. </div><div class="t m72 x4d h12 y897 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Suddenly they saw in the distance a horse-drawn carriage racing </div><div class="t m799 x6b h12 ya35 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">toward the dock. A man jumped from the carriage and started </div><div class="t m348 x17 h12 ya36 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">running. He reached the gangplank and placed one foot firmly on it </div><div class="t m622 x6b h12 ya37 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and the other on the shore, hoping to prevent the ship from sailing. </div><div class="t m3bc x4d h12 ya38 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The man looked frantic as the ship began to swing slowly away </div><div class="t m99 x17 h12 y89a ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">from shore, and the space between the gangplank and land wid-</div><div class="t m107 x17 h12 y82a ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ened. But he kept his feet planted. Some folks on shore pulled him </div><div class="t m17d x17 h12 y7d9 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">off the gangplank just in time to prevent an unplanned swim. </div><div class="t m464 x18 h12 y82c ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">They called to the family to get into a small boat anchored </div><div class="t m15d x17 h12 y89b ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">nearby. The tiny boat sped across the water to catch up with the </div><div class="t m4d2 x17 h12 ya39 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ship. It maneuvered around the side to where a door opened just </div><div class="t m256 x17 h12 y89c ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">above sea level, and the family managed to board the ship. </div><div class="t m752 x18 h12 ya3a ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Willison finished his story by saying, &quot;That man was the first </div><div class="t m79a x17 h12 y89d ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Seventh-day Adventist I ever met. Later we studied the Bible </div><div class="t m423 x17 h12 ya3b ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">together, and I joined the Adventist Church.
