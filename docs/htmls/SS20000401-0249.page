Sin is rebellion, </div><div class="t m4db x19 ha y581 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and it goes contrary to the character of God. It is the desire to establish </div><div class="t m219 x19 ha y582 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">other gods ahead of the loving, creating, and life-giving God of the </div><div class="t m43d x19 ha y5ae ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">universe. It is rooted in the desire to live our lives independently of </div><div class="t m4dc x19 ha y107 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">God. God&apos;s judgment is that &quot;the soul who sins shall die&quot; (Ezek. 18:4, </div><div class="t m264 x19 ha y549 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">NKJV). God does not desire to bring that judgment upon us sinners. </div><div class="t m4dd x19 ha y54a ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Rather, Jesus chose to take that death sentence upon Himself so that </div><div class="t m36 x19 ha y54b ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">He may give us life eternal at His return. </div><div class="t m94 x1d ha y54d ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">What caused Jesus to cry </div><div class="t mb2 xd h11 y54d ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">out in anguish to His Father?

It was the sense </div><div class="t m253 x4f ha y5b2 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of sin, bringing the Father&apos;s wrath upon Him as man&apos;s substitute, that </div><div class="t m3ee x4f ha y5b3 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">made the cup He drank so bitter, and broke the heart of the Son of </div><div class="t m1cf x4f ha y5b4 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">God.&quot;—The </div><div class="t m49b x0 ha y5b4 ff6 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Desire of Ages, </div><div class="t m2bc xb2 ha y5b4 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">p. 753. </div><div class="t m26b x66 ha y3bd ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">For the first time, the universe fully understood God&apos;s judgment on </div><div class="t m4de x4f ha y5b5 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sin. The Cross tells us how intensely sin matters to God. No wonder </div><div class="t m4df x4f ha y5b6 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">He will not deal lightly with sin. God&apos;s judgment on it must be </div><div class="t m414 x4f ha y5b7 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">understood so that it will never arise the second time. The Cross </div><div class="t m33e x4f ha y5b8 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">makes it possible for God to be understood as a God of love when He </div><div class="t m2bc x4f ha y5b9 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">destroys evil and evildoers at the end. </div><div class="t m4e0 x66 ha y5ba ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Yet, God does all in His power to draw them to Himself before the end </div><div class="t m77 x7b ha y5bb ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">comes, when it is too late.
