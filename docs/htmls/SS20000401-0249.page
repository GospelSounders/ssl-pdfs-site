Sin is rebellion, </div><div class="t m4db x1a hc y582 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and it goes contrary to the character of God. It is the desire to establish </div><div class="t m219 x1a hc y583 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">other gods ahead of the loving, creating, and life-giving God of the </div><div class="t m43d x1a hc y5af ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">universe. It is rooted in the desire to live our lives independently of </div><div class="t m4dc x1a hc y108 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">God. God&apos;s judgment is that &quot;the soul who sins shall die&quot; (Ezek. 18:4, </div><div class="t m264 x1a hc y54a ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">NKJV). God does not desire to bring that judgment upon us sinners. </div><div class="t m4dd x1a hc y54b ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Rather, Jesus chose to take that death sentence upon Himself so that </div><div class="t m36 x1a hc y54c ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">He may give us life eternal at His return. </div><div class="t m94 x1e hc y54e ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">What caused Jesus to cry </div><div class="t mb2 xe h13 y54e ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">out in anguish to His Father?

God&apos;s judgment on it must be </div><div class="t m414 x50 hc y5b8 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">understood so that it will never arise the second time. The Cross </div><div class="t m33e x50 hc y5b9 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">makes it possible for God to be understood as a God of love when He </div><div class="t m2bc x50 hc y5ba ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">destroys evil and evildoers at the end. </div><div class="t m4e0 x67 hc y5bb ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Yet, God does all in His power to draw them to Himself before the end </div><div class="t m77 x7c hc y5bc ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">comes, when it is too late.
