Hobbes said that there was only one: The </div><div class="t m9c x3e hb y7c ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">people must place themselves under a single power that would reduce </div><div class="t m9d x3e hb y7d ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">all their wills to a single will and that would exercise complete authority </div><div class="t m9e x3e hb y7e ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">over them.

In other words, in exchange for all their rights, </div><div class="t ma1 x3e hb y82 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the people got peace and security instead. This transfer of power, </div><div class="t ma2 x3e hb y83 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">from the people to the sovereign, is what Hobbes called the covenant. </div><div class="t ma3 x47 hb y84 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The covenant idea, however, did not originate with Thomas Hobbes. </div><div class="t ma4 x3e hb y85 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">On the contrary. Thousands of years earlier, God made a covenant </div><div class="t ma5 x3e hb y86 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">with Israel, a covenant whose roots, in fact, went back even farther in </div><div class="t ma6 x3e hb y87 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">time.

Also, though Hobbes&apos;s </div><div class="t ma9 x3e hb y8a ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">covenant was motivated solely by fear, God&apos;s covenant is motivated </div><div class="t maa x3e hb y8b ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">by love, His love for the fallen race, a love that led Him to the Cross. </div><div class="t mab x23 hb y8c ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Because of the Cross, we love the Sovereign back, and just as in </div><div class="t m11 x3e hb y8d ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the Hobbesian covenant, where the subjects had to surrender to the </div><div class="t m94 x3e hb y8e ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sovereign, we surrender, too—our sinful ways, our fears, our twisted </div><div class="t m9 x3e hb y8f ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">notions of right and wrong. We do this not to gain something in return </div><div class="t mac x3e hb y90 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">but because we have already been given the best the Sovereign can </div><div class="t mad x3e hb y91 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">give—Jesus Christ and the redemption found only in Him. </div><div class="t mae x23 hb y92 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">This quarter we look closely at what God&apos;s covenant is, what it </div><div class="t maf x3e hb y93 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">offers, even what it demands.
