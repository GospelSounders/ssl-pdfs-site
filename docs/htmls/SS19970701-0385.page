As you read Matthew 18:23-35, try </div><div class="t med x4e h16 y9d3 ff3 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to determine which verses fall into each act.

But his debt was enormous. Most likely it </div><div class="t m69a x4e h17 y9d9 ff4 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was more than the total budget for the province in which he lived. In </div><div class="t m4cd x4e h17 y9da ff4 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">other terms, it equaled 60 million working days! Obviously, the king </div><div class="t m691 x4e h17 y9db ff4 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">knew there was no way the servant could repay him. Likewise, there is </div><div class="t m69b x4e h17 y9dc ff4 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">nothing we can do to pay the debt of sin we owe. But when we </div><div class="t m4b5 x4e h17 y9dd ff4 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sincerely repent, God frees us from that debt. </div><div class="t m317 x1f h16 y9de ff3 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">What does the servant&apos;s behavior in Matthew 18:28-30 tell us about </div><div class="t m249 xc h16 y7f ff3 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the nature of his repentance?

Contrast that to the debt owed by the first </div><div class="t m69d xc h17 y85 ff4 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">servant, and you can better understand how selfish the first servant </div><div class="t m496 xc h17 y86 ff4 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was. He did not need the money to pay back his debt, for the king had </div><div class="t m69e xc h17 y892 ff4 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">pardoned it. Obviously he cared only for himself.
