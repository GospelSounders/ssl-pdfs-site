Although </div><div class="t m0 x6b h37 y46d ff12 fs3 fc3 sc0 ls2 ws40">only in his 20s, he had risen to the position of commander for his political </div><div class="t m0 x6b h37 y46e ff12 fs3 fc3 sc0 ls2 ws13f">party in his village and the surrounding area. He had been taught to torture </div><div class="t m0 x6b h37 y46f ff12 fs3 fc3 sc0 ls2 ws106">or kill anyone who did not follow the teachings of his political party or </div><div class="t m0 x6b h37 y470 ff12 fs3 fc3 sc0 ls2 ws6">give in to his demands. His word was law!</div><div class="t m0 x40 h37 y471 ff12 fs3 fc3 sc0 ls2 ws78">He left his home and lived with his troops in the mountain jungles. </div><div class="t m0 x6b h37 y472 ff12 fs3 fc3 sc0 ls2 ws96">They raided the nearby villages and terrorized the people. When the rebels </div><div class="t m0 x6b h37 y473 ff12 fs3 fc3 sc0 ls2 ws7c">needed food or money, they would simply enter a village and take what </div><div class="t m0 x6b h37 y474 ff12 fs3 fc3 sc0 ls2 ws6">they wanted. </div><div class="t m0 x40 h37 y475 ff12 fs3 fc3 sc0 ls2 ws15d">One day Prakash and his troops entered a Seventh-day Adventist church, </div><div class="t m0 x6b h37 y476 ff12 fs3 fc3 sc0 ls2 ws7a">planning to steal the offering, terrorize the members, and burn down the </div><div class="t m0 x6b h37 y477 ff12 fs3 fc3 sc0 ls2 ws61">church. But God had other plans. When Prakash demanded that the pastor </div><div class="t m0 x6b h37 y478 ff12 fs3 fc3 sc0 ls2 ws31">give him the offering, the pastor answered bravely, “Take God’s money, </div><div class="t m0 x6b h37 y479 ff12 fs3 fc3 sc0 ls2 ws6">but if you give your life to Jesus, He will change you completely.”</div><div class="t m0 x40 h37 y47a ff12 fs3 fc3 sc0 ls2 ws140">Prakash thought little of the pastor’s words, but some of his troops </div><div class="t m0 x6b h37 y47b ff12 fs3 fc3 sc0 ls2 ws7a">deserted his command and joined the church. When Prakash talked with </div><div class="t m0 x6b h37 y47c ff12 fs3 fc3 sc0 ls2 ws59">these former rebels, he noticed remarkable changes in their characters. </div><div class="t m0 x6b h37 y47d ff11 fs3 fc3 sc0 ls2 ws6">Could Jesus change me too?<span class="ff12"> he wondered.</span></div><div class="t m0 x40 h37 y47e ff12 fs3 fc3 sc0 ls2 ws12b">Then Prakash discovered a program on the radio called <span class="ff11">Ashako Bani.</span><span class="ws5"> </span></div><div class="t m0 x6b h37 y47f ff12 fs3 fc3 sc0 ls2 wsf7">The speaker talked about Jesus. As Prakash listened, he sensed that his life </div><div class="t m0 x6b h37 y480 ff12 fs3 fc3 sc0 ls2 wscc">was changing, just as the pastor said it would. Prakash became aware that </div><div class="t m0 x6b h37 y481 ff12 fs3 fc3 sc0 ls2 ws6">life was precious; he could no longer torture or kill. </div><div class="t m0 x40 h37 y482 ff12 fs3 fc3 sc0 ls2 wsda">Prakash knew that he must leave the rebels, but he had taken an oath. </div><div class="t m0 x6b h37 y483 ff12 fs3 fc3 sc0 ls2 ws5a">“Keep your promise or be killed,” he was told. But Prakash gave his life </div><div class="t m0 x6b h37 y484 ff12 fs3 fc3 sc0 ls2 ws6">to Christ; he was not afraid.</div><div class="t m0 x40 h37 y485 ff12 fs3 fc3 sc0 ls2 wse3">One day Prakash called the studio of Adventist World Radio, which </div><div class="t m0 x6b h37 y486 ff12 fs3 fc3 sc0 ls2 ws9a">produces the program that had brought him to Jesus. “I believe in Jesus </div><div class="t m0 x6b h37 y487 ff12 fs3 fc3 sc0 ls2 wsad">and know that you teach from the Bible,” he said. “I listen to your pro<span class="ws5">-</span></div><div class="t m0 x6b h37 y488 ff12 fs3 fc3 sc0 ls2 ws96">grams, and I tell my friends to listen, as well.
