Often a common narrative or ordinary circumstance is </div><div class="t m6af x26 he y368 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">used to illustrate a truth. One of Jesus&apos; favorite teaching devices was </div><div class="t md6 x26 he y1a0 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the use of parables. (See Matt. 13:34.) </div><div class="t m2f1 x25 h2a y120 ff3 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">What major truth did Jesus illustrate in the parable of the hidden </div><div class="t m3a1 x26 h2a y3f7 ff3 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">treasure? Matt. 13:44. </div><div class="t md3 x25 he y123 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">This parable is based on a rather common occurrence in the Palestine </div><div class="t m385 x26 he y1a6 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of Christ&apos;s day. It was a time when bank vaults did not exist. Thefts, </div><div class="t m485 x26 he y125 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">robberies, and invasions were frequent. Those who had valuables </div><div class="t m15f x26 he y1a7 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">worth trying to preserve often followed the custom of burying them in </div><div class="t m6b0 x26 he y40 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">their fields. If, however, the individual or individuals who knew where </div><div class="t m63b x26 he y127 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the family treasure was hidden were slain or exiled, the place where the </div><div class="t m58b x26 he y1a9 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">treasure had been concealed might be forgotten. </div><div class="t m34f x25 he y2a9 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">In this parable a man was working his neighbor&apos;s field on shares. </div><div class="t m170 x26 he y43 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">One day he was plowing the field when, suddenly, the plow struck </div><div class="t m6b1 x26 he y12c ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">something metallic. He stopped the oxen and found a small treasure </div><div class="t m118 x26 he ydf ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">chest. As he broke it open, he recognized that it contained a fortune far </div><div class="t m2e0 x26 he y393 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">exceeding anything he ever hoped to own. But according to the laws of </div><div class="t m184 x26 he ye1 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that country, it wasn&apos;t his unless he owned the field. Covering it up, he </div><div class="t m2c4 x26 he y12d ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ran over to the owner&apos;s house and urged him to sell the field. </div><div class="t m43c x43 he y1ac ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;I&apos;m sorry, friend. It&apos;s not for sale. This property has been in my </div><div class="t m487 x26 he y12e ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">family for generations, and I don&apos;t want to sell it.&quot; But the anxious </div><div class="t m233 x26 he y396 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">purchaser wouldn&apos;t take No for an answer. Finally the owner, in order to </div><div class="t m210 x26 he y74 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">get rid of him, placed a ridiculously high price on the field. &quot;All right, I&apos;ll </div><div class="t m6b2 x26 he y12f ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">buy it!&quot; the discoverer of the treasure answered, rushing off to sell </div><div class="t m2a2 x26 he y75 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">everything he owned so he could complete the transaction. </div><div class="t m263 x25 he y76 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Jesus did not tell the story to teach us how to take advantage of our </div><div class="t m34f x26 he ya4 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">neighbors. The point is that when we find hidden treasure worth far </div><div class="t m464 x26 he y1ae ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">more than anything we ever expected to be ours, we joyfully give all we </div><div class="t m6b3 x26 he y7a ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">have for it. </div><div class="t m14c x43 he y1af ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;This parable illustrates the value of the heavenly treasure, and the </div><div class="t m632 x26 he y7c ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">effort that should be made to secure it.

So the finder of heavenly </div><div class="t m1f6 x26 he y438 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">treasure will count no labor too great and no sacrifice too dear, in order </div><div class="t m38a x26 he y4d4 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to gain the treasures of truth. </div><div class="t m263 x43 he y2b1 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;In the parable the field containing the treasure represents the Holy </div><div class="t m23f x26 he y291 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Scriptures.
