Sri enjoyed </div><div class="t m605 x55 h15 y71e ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">studying at the Adventist elementary school, and he especially </div><div class="t m18f x55 h15 y71f ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">enjoyed the Bible classes. He continued his studies in a Christian </div><div class="t m137 x55 h15 y720 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">secondary school. After graduation he found work with a bank and </div><div class="t mae x1e h15 y721 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">married a Christian woman.

Sri prayed for the Holy Spirit to </div><div class="t m179 x1e h15 y730 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">bring conviction to the members of his class. Today this group has </div><div class="t m2da x1e h15 y731 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">grown to a full-fledged church of 100 members. </div><div class="t m60b x1f h15 y732 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Sri found a suburb of Jakarta where no church existed.
