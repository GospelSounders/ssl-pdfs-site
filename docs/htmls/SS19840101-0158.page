So they cast lots, and the lot </div><div class="t m3b5 x77 h1a y733 ff6 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">fell upon Jonah&quot; (Jonah 1:7). </div><div class="t m2d x86 h21 y734 ff5 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Be sure your sin will find you out&quot; (Num. 32:23), Moses had cau-</div><div class="t m29b x77 h21 y665 ff5 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tioned Israel, urging them to obey. If Jonah had purposely hidden away in </div><div class="t m4da x77 h21 y735 ff5 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the hold, he was now brought to full view. Prodded with questions as to </div><div class="t m26b x77 h21 y667 ff5 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">origin, occupation, and purpose of journey, he told all. Before the con-</div><div class="t m216 x77 h21 y668 ff5 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">fused mariners he told of his belief in the Creator-God who also made the </div><div class="t m192 x77 h21 y1b ff5 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sea.

Even in his disobedience they still perceived him to be God&apos;s prophet </div><div class="t m336 x77 h21 y32 ff5 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and servant. His willingness to make amends heightened their respect for </div><div class="t m469 x77 h21 y66b ff5 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">him and his God. Note their spirit as they rowed hard, yet in vain, to bring </div><div class="t m405 x77 h21 y73a ff5 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">them to shore rather than take Jonah up on his offer (verse 13).
