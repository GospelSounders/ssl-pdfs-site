Both of my parents are </div><div class="t m5c3 x13 h1d y3f1 ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">teachers; my father teaches music, my mother teaches reading. Music </div><div class="t m493 x13 h1d y720 ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was a part of our family, but I didn&apos;t start singing publicly until I was </div><div class="t m16a x13 h1d y115 ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">a senior in high school. Music became more and more of a joy to me, </div><div class="t m38b x13 h1d y116 ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and I eventually decided to study opera. </div><div class="t mfd x1b h1d y164 ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">While singing at a music festival, I met Julie Karpenko, a member </div><div class="t m318 x13 h1d y117 ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of the chorus. As we talked, I noticed she was deeply spiritual. We </div><div class="t m5c4 x13 h1d y118 ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">spent many hours sharing our mutual interest of music and becoming </div><div class="t m5c5 x13 h1d y119 ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">friends. I learned that she was a Seventh-day Adventist. I had heard </div><div class="t m5c6 x13 h1d y11a ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of Adventists, but did not know much of what they believe. </div><div class="t m345 x24 h1d y11b ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I was convinced that I was following God&apos;s truths, but how could </div><div class="t m5c7 x13 h1d y11c ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">we both be right and believe so differently? As I studied my Bible </div><div class="t ma7 x13 h1d y721 ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and listened to some super sermons, I kept hearing some things that </div><div class="t m3fa x13 h1d y722 ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">did not square with my beliefs. I searched my Bible to verify my </div><div class="t m4fc x13 h1d y79 ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">beliefs and was shocked to discover that the Bible upheld Adventist </div><div class="t m1ea x13 h1d y7a ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">teachings, especially regarding the Sabbath and prophecy. </div><div class="t m5c8 x24 h1d y723 ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Then Julie told me about satellite evangelistic meetings in my </div><div class="t m5c9 x13 h1d y724 ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">area. I found a church that was presenting the programs and attended </div><div class="t m5ca x13 h1d y11e ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">nearly every meeting. I found answers to several big questions. I saw </div><div class="t ma9 x13 h1d y11f ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that there is no reasonable explanation for Sunday worship, but the </div><div class="t m32f x13 h1d y120 ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Bible contains ample support for the Sabbath. I realized that the </div><div class="t m55d x22 h1d y121 ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Adventist church has a more truthful understanding of the Bible as a </div><div class="t m363 x13 h1d y122 ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">whole. And as a Christian, I felt it was my privilege and duty to join </div><div class="t m345 x22 h1d y123 ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the Seventh-day Adventist Church. </div><div class="t m294 x24 h1d y82 ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Since then Julie Karpenko and I have been married. We have </div><div class="t m13c x22 h1d y125 ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">completed our studies and enjoy singing together for God&apos;s glory. </div><div class="t m5c3 x22 h1d y725 ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">We look forward to seeing what God has in store for us in the field of </div><div class="t m5cb x22 h1d y4f ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">music, for which we have trained. </div><div class="t m2c9 x16 h1d y726 ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Two years ago I had never heard of Seventh-day Adventists. I&apos;ve </div><div class="t m6b x90 h1d y727 ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">seen how God has led in my life, how He has </div><div class="t m18c x90 h1d y728 ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">opened doors that I dared not dream of. He has </div><div class="t m5cc x90 h1d y729 ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">set me in new places at every turn, and these </div><div class="t m4e2 xbd h1d y72a ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">places have always been better than I could </div><div class="t m401 x90 h1d y72b ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">have imagined. Therefore, I have stopped try-</div><div class="t m13a xbd h1d y703 ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ing to plan for myself or even guess where God </div><div class="t m172 xbd h1d y72c ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">will take me. All I know is that the talents He </div><div class="t m5cd xbd h1d y12c ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">has given to me I gladly give back to Him, to be </div><div class="t mf9 xbd h1d y72d ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">used for His honor where ever He sees fit. </div><div class="t m5ce x16 h28 y12f ff4 fs1b fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Charles and Julie Reid live in Princeton, New Jersey.
