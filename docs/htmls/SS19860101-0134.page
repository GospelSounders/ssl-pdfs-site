We have great confi-</div><div class="t m3f9 xa2 hb y50f ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">dence in the doctor and all his associates; we have faith that the medicine </div><div class="t m500 xa2 hb y510 ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">likewise will provide healing. But it is the divinely-directed operation of </div><div class="t m501 xa2 hb y511 ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">nature that in the end brings healing. Doctors admit that they have no </div><div class="t m502 xa2 hb y512 ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">power to cure disease, nor does the medicine they prescribe cure, al-</div><div class="t m503 xa2 hb y3ca ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">though it may assist the healing process. Doctors are instruments in </div><div class="t m504 xa2 hb y3cb ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">God&apos;s hand, and it is God&apos;s power that brings healing. Antibiotics can kill </div><div class="t m505 x6 hb y513 ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">disease germs, but that does not make the patient well. God has to heal </div><div class="t m3f4 xa2 hb y3cd ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the inflamed area and repair the damage. Because the same Greek word </div><div class="t m18d xa2 hb y3ce ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">used in the New Testament for &quot;saving&quot; sometimes is used for &quot;healing,&quot; </div><div class="t m506 xa2 hb y3cf ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">it would be consistent to read the verse this way: &quot;By grace are ye saved </div><div class="t m27a x6 hb y3d0 ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">[healed] through faith; and that not of yourselves.&quot; </div><div class="t m138 xa5 hb y3d1 ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Salvation, then, is a free gift from God received by means of faith. This </div><div class="t m507 x6 hb y3d2 ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">faith does not originate in us, but it can reside in us and work for us. Paul </div><div class="t m28e x6 hb y3d3 ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">says that it is &quot;the operation of God&quot; (Col. 2:12).
