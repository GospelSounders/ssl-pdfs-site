It is said that the only time a sea </div><div class="t m268 x5f h11 y97a ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">gypsy sets foot on land is when he is buried. </div><div class="t m29d x4 h11 y97b ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Before long I noticed that something was wrong. We were off </div><div class="t m591 x3d h11 y97c ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">course. I asked our pilot about it, and he replied that something </div><div class="t m16d x5f h11 ya8 ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">must be wrong with the rudder; for he could not control the boat. </div><div class="t m3d x3d h11 y97d ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The boat had been designed with an especially large rudder, so it </div><div class="t m2f9 x3d h11 y97e ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">would be more responsive, but instead it seemed to go its own way </div><div class="t m18e x3d h11 y4d7 ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in spite of all the efforts put forth by the pilot. </div><div class="t m358 x4 h11 y97f ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">We came into view of an Adventist settlement of homes that </div><div class="t m8c x3d h11 y980 ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">stands on stilts in the shallow waters off a coral island.

While we worked on the </div><div class="t m10 x3d h11 y982 ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">boat, we learned that one of the pioneer Adventists in the area, an </div><div class="t m22f x3d h11 y983 ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">old man, was very sick. The symptoms sounded as though he had </div><div class="t m227 x3d h11 y984 ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">malaria. </div><div class="t m29c x40 h11 y985 ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I climbed the ladder to his home and prayed with him. Then we </div><div class="t m1da x3d h11 y986 ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">rubbed him with some rubbing alcohol, the only medicine we had </div><div class="t m405 x3d h11 y987 ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">with us. As we turned to leave, the man, a sea gypsy himself, </div><div class="t m150 x3d h11 y988 ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">struggled to sit up then gave us some advice. &quot;If the rudder defies </div><div class="t m4d8 x3d h11 y355 ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">you, cancel your trip.&quot; </div><div class="t m3d x40 h11 y356 ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">We decided that was good advice and started back toward our </div><div class="t m4a8 x3d h11 y357 ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">base.
