This </div><div class="t m3f4 x41 h15 y3e9 ff4 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">makes it necessary for every generation of believers, in every country </div><div class="t mfe x95 h15 yb0c ff4 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and culture, to discover for themselves how to apply the biblical princi-</div><div class="t m378 x41 h15 yb0d ff4 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ples to their particular situation. </div><div class="t m469 x46 h15 y3ec ff4 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">It has become evident, further, that these biblical principles are based </div><div class="t m6e3 x41 h15 y39d ff4 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">on two premises. The first is that the whole world lies in the power of </div><div class="t m92 x41 h15 y33b ff4 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sin and that everything in this world is affected by its evil influence. </div><div class="t m2b6 x41 h15 yb0e ff4 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Therefore, Christians should shun this world, that is, its corruption, </div><div class="t m3ad x41 h15 yb0f ff4 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">wickedness, and association with evil. The other basic premise is that </div><div class="t m6e9 x41 h15 y3ee ff4 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">God loves this world. Out of love He created it and endowed it with </div><div class="t m5c3 x41 h15 y3ef ff4 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">riches, beauty, energies, and wonderful things for people to enjoy. Out </div><div class="t m16d x41 h15 yb10 ff4 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of love God is actively at work in this world (John 5:17) to save it and to </div><div class="t m11c x49 h15 yb11 ff4 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">restore it so that it can fulfill the purpose for which it was made. </div><div class="t m4eb x4b h15 yb12 ff4 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Perhaps no other biblical image describes this twofold attitude toward </div><div class="t m827 x49 h15 yb13 ff4 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the world better than that of light. It views the world as darkness and </div><div class="t m209 x49 h15 yb14 ff4 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the church as light.

On the </div><div class="t m286 x49 h15 y348 ff4 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">other hand, the image of light also emphasizes its role of shining to scat-</div><div class="t m658 x49 h15 y84c ff4 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ter darkness and the need of light in a dark place (Matt. 5:14-16).
