She </div><div class="t m0 x50 h4 y2dc ff79 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws1">prays for people until God answers.</div><div class="t m0 x6 h4 y2dd ff79 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 wscc">One day at school Mila saw her teachers outside during their break </div><div class="t m0 x50 h4 y2de ff79 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws52">smoking cigarettes. Mila knows that smoking is dangerous, so right there </div><div class="t m0 x50 h4 y2df ff79 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 wsea">she prayed for them. “Dear Jesus,” she said, “please help my teachers </div><div class="t m0 x50 h4 y2e0 ff79 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws97">know that smoking is bad for them. Help them to stop smoking before it </div><div class="t m0 x50 h4 y2e1 ff79 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws1">makes them sick. Amen.”</div><div class="t m0 x6 h4 y2e2 ff79 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls1 ws41">That evening when Father arrived home, he saw Mila sitting on the couch </div><div class="t m0 x50 h4 y2e3 ff79 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls1 ws37">with her head bowed. He wondered if something was wrong. He touched </div><div class="t m0 x50 h4 y2e4 ff79 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls1 ws78">her and asked if she was OK. Mila looked up and said, “I’m fine. I’m just </div><div class="t m0 x50 h4 y2e5 ff79 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls1 ws1">praying for my teachers. They smoke, and I don’t want them to get sick.” </div><div class="t m0 x6 h4 y2e6 ff79 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws1">Daddy knew about Mila’s prayer ministry. He sat down beside her and </div><div class="t m0 x50 h4 y2e7 ff79 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws48">asked, “Would you pray for a woman at work? She smokes too.” Mila </div><div class="t m0 x50 h4 y2e8 ff79 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws1a">smiled and bowed her head. She prayed for Daddy’s friend at work and </div><div class="t m0 x50 h4 y2e9 ff79 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 wsa2">for her teachers. Mila kept praying for her teachers and her father’s friend </div><div class="t m0 x50 h4 y2ea ff79 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws1">every day. </div><div class="t m0 x6 h4 y2eb ff79 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 wsc5">Several weeks later, Daddy came home from work and told Mila that </div><div class="t m0 x50 h4 y2ec ff79 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 wsa9">his friend at work had stopped smoking. The woman told him that one </div><div class="t m0 x50 h4 y2ed ff79 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws83">day she had suddenly lost her desire to smoke and hadn’t smoked again. </div><div class="t m0 x50 h4 y2ee ff79 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 wsba">Daddy knew that the woman had tried to stop smoking many times before, </div><div class="t m0 x50 h4 y2ef ff79 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws1">but she had failed.</div><div class="t m0 x6 h4 y2f0 ff79 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 wsda">“What day did you stop smoking?” he asked. The woman thought for </div><div class="t m0 x50 h4 y2f1 ff79 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws6c">a minute and then told him the date. “That was the day after my daugh<span class="ws0">-</span></div><div class="t m0 x50 h4 y2f2 ff79 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 wse5">ter started praying for you,” he said. Daddy told the woman that Mila </div><div class="t m0 x50 h4 y2f3 ff79 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws106">had been praying that she would stop smoking. She was surprised that a </div><div class="t m0 x50 h4 y2f4 ff79 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws1">child’s prayer could help her to stop smoking when nothing else could. </div><div class="t m0 x6 h4 y2f5 ff79 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws6a">“My teachers still smoke,” Mila said. “And I’m still praying for them. </div><div class="t m0 x50 h4 y2f6 ff79 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 wsf8">Sometimes I tell them that smoking is bad for them and that I’m con<span class="ws0">-</span></div><div class="t m0 x50 h4 y2f7 ff79 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws19">cerned about them. I’ve told them that I’m praying for them. My teacher </div><div class="t m0 x50 h4 y2f8 ff79 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 wsf8">says that she wants to stop smoking,” Mila added. “I’m sure God will </div><div class="t m0 x50 h4 y2f9 ff79 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws1">answer my prayers.” </div><div class="t m0 x6 h4 y2fa ff79 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws139">God answers our prayers, but He never forces someone to do something </div><div class="t m0 x50 h4 y2fb ff79 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws19">against their wishes. When we pray for others, God works in their hearts </div><div class="t m0 x50 h4 y2fc ff79 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws74">and in ours to answer those prayers. When we pray that people will meet </div><div class="t m0 x50 h4 y2fd ff79 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws86">God and accept Jesus’ love, we must be willing to help make that happen </div><div class="t m0 x50 h4 y2fe ff79 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws1">if God calls us.</div><div class="t m0 x6 h4 y2ff ff79 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws15">Our mission offerings help to provide tools to lead others to Christ, no </div><div class="t m0 x50 h4 y300 ff79 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 wsc3">matter where they are.
