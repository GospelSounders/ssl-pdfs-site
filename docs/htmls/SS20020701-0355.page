Zachary </div><div class="t m189 x2 h33 y64b ff1 fs1d fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">When Felix was a teenager, Protestant pastors occasionally came </div><div class="t m428 x6e h33 y64c ff1 fs1d fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to speak at his school. Several times the students chased the pastors </div><div class="t m144 x6e h33 y64d ff1 fs1d fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">out of the village, and sometimes Felix joined them. But he could not </div><div class="t m15e x6e h33 y64e ff1 fs1d fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">deny that these pastors were different from the religious leaders he </div><div class="t m439 x6e h33 y64f ff1 fs1d fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">knew. </div><div class="t m580 x2 h33 y3fa ff1 fs1d fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">After high school, Felix started a little business, but it went </div><div class="t m280 x6e h33 y3fb ff1 fs1d fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">bankrupt. Felix felt a great emptiness in his life. With time on his </div><div class="t m20b x6e h33 y650 ff1 fs1d fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">hands, he thought a lot about spiritual matters. He remembered the </div><div class="t m365 x6e h33 y651 ff1 fs1d fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">pastors that he had helped drive out of the village. What made them </div><div class="t m40b x6e h33 y652 ff1 fs1d fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">different? He remembered the importance these pastors placed on the </div><div class="t m2b6 x6e h33 y653 ff1 fs1d fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Bible. </div><div class="t m581 x2 h33 y654 ff1 fs1d fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Felix bought a Bible and began to read it, searching for spiritual </div><div class="t m1ef xe h33 y655 ff1 fs1d fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">meaning to life. One day he passed a public meeting held by a Protes-</div><div class="t m582 x6e h33 y656 ff1 fs1d fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tant group. He stopped to listen and decided to attend the meetings. He </div><div class="t m389 x6e h33 y403 ff1 fs1d fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">arranged for studies and planned to join this church. But before he </div><div class="t m4ff x6e h33 y4e4 ff1 fs1d fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">could join, an elderly Adventist neighbor invited him to evangelistic </div><div class="t m184 xe h33 y657 ff1 fs1d fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">meetings in town.

Felix noticed that the </div><div class="t m16c xe h33 y65b ff1 fs1d fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">pastor quoted many Bible texts. Felix began following the pastor&apos;s </div><div class="t m88 xe h33 y65c ff1 fs1d fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">study in his own Bible. Night after night he listened from his porch. </div><div class="t m394 x2 h33 y65d ff1 fs1d fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">When the message on the Sabbath was presented, Felix felt strong </div><div class="t m545 xe h33 y65e ff1 fs1d fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">conviction. He left home and walked to the meeting. He arrived just as </div><div class="t m583 xe h33 y4e9 ff1 fs1d fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the pastor made an altar call. Felix never took his seat, but walked </div><div class="t m15a xe h33 y65f ff1 fs1d fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">straight to the front in response to the pastor&apos;s invitation. </div><div class="t m57f x2 h33 y660 ff1 fs1d fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">When Felix returned home, he told his brother with whom he was </div><div class="t mb3 xe h33 y661 ff1 fs1d fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">living about what he had learned from the Bible.
