Several times the students chased the pastors </div><div class="t m144 x6d h30 y64c ff1 fs1d fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">out of the village, and sometimes Felix joined them. But he could not </div><div class="t m15e x6d h30 y64d ff1 fs1d fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">deny that these pastors were different from the religious leaders he </div><div class="t m439 x6d h30 y64e ff1 fs1d fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">knew. </div><div class="t m580 x1 h30 y3f9 ff1 fs1d fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">After high school, Felix started a little business, but it went </div><div class="t m280 x6d h30 y3fa ff1 fs1d fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">bankrupt. Felix felt a great emptiness in his life. With time on his </div><div class="t m20b x6d h30 y64f ff1 fs1d fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">hands, he thought a lot about spiritual matters. He remembered the </div><div class="t m365 x6d h30 y650 ff1 fs1d fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">pastors that he had helped drive out of the village. What made them </div><div class="t m40b x6d h30 y651 ff1 fs1d fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">different? He remembered the importance these pastors placed on the </div><div class="t m2b6 x6d h30 y652 ff1 fs1d fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Bible. </div><div class="t m581 x1 h30 y653 ff1 fs1d fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Felix bought a Bible and began to read it, searching for spiritual </div><div class="t m1ef xd h30 y654 ff1 fs1d fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">meaning to life. One day he passed a public meeting held by a Protes-</div><div class="t m582 x6d h30 y655 ff1 fs1d fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tant group. He stopped to listen and decided to attend the meetings. He </div><div class="t m389 x6d h30 y402 ff1 fs1d fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">arranged for studies and planned to join this church. But before he </div><div class="t m4ff x6d h30 y4e3 ff1 fs1d fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">could join, an elderly Adventist neighbor invited him to evangelistic </div><div class="t m184 xd h30 y656 ff1 fs1d fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">meetings in town.

Felix noticed that the </div><div class="t m16c xd h30 y65a ff1 fs1d fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">pastor quoted many Bible texts. Felix began following the pastor&apos;s </div><div class="t m88 xd h30 y65b ff1 fs1d fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">study in his own Bible. Night after night he listened from his porch. </div><div class="t m394 x1 h30 y65c ff1 fs1d fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">When the message on the Sabbath was presented, Felix felt strong </div><div class="t m545 xd h30 y65d ff1 fs1d fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">conviction. He left home and walked to the meeting. He arrived just as </div><div class="t m583 xd h30 y4e8 ff1 fs1d fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the pastor made an altar call.
