All around him was </div><div class="t m83 x67 h20 y496 ff4 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sand. For some time he could hear the barking of dogs, the hum of activity </div><div class="t m140 x67 h20 y497 ff4 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in the village he had left. He was aware of human life. But soon it became </div><div class="t m195 x67 h20 y498 ff4 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">very dark, the sounds were lost, and he found himself looking up at a vast </div><div class="t m388 x67 h20 y499 ff4 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sky with millions of twinkling stars. He suddenly realized how tiny he was, </div><div class="t m23e x67 h20 y49a ff4 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">how vulnerable. Later he testified that he had felt the presence of God as </div><div class="t m153 x67 h20 y49b ff4 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">he had never felt it before. It is when we recognize our smallness, that we </div><div class="t m28a x67 h20 y49c ff4 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">can sense God&apos;s greatness. </div><div class="t m389 x67 h21 y49d ff1 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">8.

Elsewhere the psalmist says that God spoke, and &quot;it was </div><div class="t m2a2 x51 h20 y4a2 ff4 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">done&quot; (Ps. 33:9). Here God uses only the tips of His fingers. This is sym-</div><div class="t mcc x51 h20 y4a3 ff4 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">bolic language, of course, but it emphasizes the effortlessness of God&apos;s ac-</div><div class="t m38b x51 h20 y4a4 ff4 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tivity in creating what to us is gigantic.
