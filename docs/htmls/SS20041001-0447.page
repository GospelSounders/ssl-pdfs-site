Michelle rushed to the hospital and found Sofia lying unconscious. </div><div class="t m548 x20 h8 y339 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Bruises and wounds covered her body. </div><div class="t m549 x0 h8 y5e5 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Michelle wanted to run from the room. What had she done to her friend </div><div class="t m94 x20 h8 y5e6 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">by sharing Christ? How could her husband do this to her? Michelle took </div><div class="t m359 x20 h8 y5e7 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Sofia&apos;s hand and began to pray. As she prayed, she felt Sofia&apos;s hand tighten </div><div class="t m442 x20 h8 y5e8 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in hers. </div><div class="t m445 x0 h8 y5e9 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Sofia came out of the coma briefly when her brother visited. She begged </div><div class="t m4a8 x20 h8 y5ea ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">him to give his life to God; then she slipped back into the coma and died. </div><div class="t m22b x0 h8 y5eb ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Michelle was numb with grief and guilt. She agonized over what she </div><div class="t m3be x20 h8 y5ec ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">could have done differently to prevent this senseless murder. During the </div><div class="t mda x20 h8 y106 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">week of mourning, Michelle visited Sofia&apos;s home and sat with the women </div><div class="t m486 x20 h8 y340 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">every day. She did it for Hans and Anna, to let them know she cared. But </div><div class="t m54a x20 h8 y5ed ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">her presence had an impact on others, as well. Even Sofia&apos;s husband </div><div class="t m275 x20 h8 y5ee ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">seemed to soften. </div><div class="t m32b x0 h8 y5ef ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">One day Sofia&apos;s husband came to ask Michelle&apos;s forgiveness for what he </div><div class="t m12 x9b h8 y5f0 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">had done to Sofia. Michelle nodded, but in her heart a battle waged. How </div><div class="t me4 x9b h8 y5f1 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">could she really forgive a man who had murdered his wife, the mother of </div><div class="t ma9 x9b h8 y5f2 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">his children, her friend? </div><div class="t m40c x60 h8 y25e ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Two years later he again visited Michelle. He wanted to remarry and </div><div class="t m54b x9b h8 y25f ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">wanted her advice. Michelle listened in stunned silence to this man&apos;s </div><div class="t m54c x9b h8 y345 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">description of the woman he now loved. Michelle encouraged him to </div><div class="t m432 x9b h8 y5f3 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">marry the woman. </div><div class="t m4f x60 h8 y5f4 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Hans and Anna seemed to adapt well to their new mother. Then, with-</div><div class="t m54d x9b h8 y5f5 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">out warning, Anna came to Michelle and asked to be baptized. Images of </div><div class="t m54e x9b h8 y5f6 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">a bruised and beaten Sofia flooded Michelle&apos;s mind. </div><div class="t m69 x60 h8 y5f7 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;No!&quot; she whispered fiercely. &quot;Anna, don&apos;t you remember what hap-</div><div class="t m54f x9b h8 y5f8 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">pened to your mother?&quot; </div><div class="t m550 x60 h8 y5f9 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Yes,&quot; Anna said, &quot;but I want to be baptized.&quot; </div><div class="t m14 x60 h8 y5fa ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;But Anna,&quot; Michelle protested, &quot;you must ask your father.&quot; </div><div class="t mb6 x60 h8 y1a9 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;My father knows,&quot; Anna replied, &quot;and he is happy for me.

She prayed for the girl, for her father, and for those whose lives </div><div class="t mde x9c h8 y5fd ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">will be touched by Anna&apos;s decision to follow Jesus. </div><div class="t m553 x9c ha y403 ff2 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Homer Trecartin is Secretary-Treasurer of the Middle East Union in Nicosia, Cyprus.
