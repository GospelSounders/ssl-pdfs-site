Michelle rushed to the hospital and found Sofia lying unconscious. </div><div class="t m548 x21 ha y33a ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Bruises and wounds covered her body. </div><div class="t m549 x1 ha y5e6 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Michelle wanted to run from the room. What had she done to her friend </div><div class="t m94 x21 ha y5e7 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">by sharing Christ? How could her husband do this to her? Michelle took </div><div class="t m359 x21 ha y5e8 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Sofia&apos;s hand and began to pray. As she prayed, she felt Sofia&apos;s hand tighten </div><div class="t m442 x21 ha y5e9 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in hers. </div><div class="t m445 x1 ha y5ea ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Sofia came out of the coma briefly when her brother visited. She begged </div><div class="t m4a8 x21 ha y5eb ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">him to give his life to God; then she slipped back into the coma and died. </div><div class="t m22b x1 ha y5ec ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Michelle was numb with grief and guilt. She agonized over what she </div><div class="t m3be x21 ha y5ed ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">could have done differently to prevent this senseless murder. During the </div><div class="t mda x21 ha y107 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">week of mourning, Michelle visited Sofia&apos;s home and sat with the women </div><div class="t m486 x21 ha y341 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">every day. She did it for Hans and Anna, to let them know she cared. But </div><div class="t m54a x21 ha y5ee ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">her presence had an impact on others, as well. Even Sofia&apos;s husband </div><div class="t m275 x21 ha y5ef ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">seemed to soften. </div><div class="t m32b x1 ha y5f0 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">One day Sofia&apos;s husband came to ask Michelle&apos;s forgiveness for what he </div><div class="t m12 x9c ha y5f1 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">had done to Sofia. Michelle nodded, but in her heart a battle waged. How </div><div class="t me4 x9c ha y5f2 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">could she really forgive a man who had murdered his wife, the mother of </div><div class="t ma9 x9c ha y5f3 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">his children, her friend? </div><div class="t m40c x61 ha y25f ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Two years later he again visited Michelle. He wanted to remarry and </div><div class="t m54b x9c ha y260 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">wanted her advice. Michelle listened in stunned silence to this man&apos;s </div><div class="t m54c x9c ha y346 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">description of the woman he now loved. Michelle encouraged him to </div><div class="t m432 x9c ha y5f4 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">marry the woman. </div><div class="t m4f x61 ha y5f5 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Hans and Anna seemed to adapt well to their new mother. Then, with-</div><div class="t m54d x9c ha y5f6 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">out warning, Anna came to Michelle and asked to be baptized. Images of </div><div class="t m54e x9c ha y5f7 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">a bruised and beaten Sofia flooded Michelle&apos;s mind. </div><div class="t m69 x61 ha y5f8 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;No!&quot; she whispered fiercely. &quot;Anna, don&apos;t you remember what hap-</div><div class="t m54f x9c ha y5f9 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">pened to your mother?&quot; </div><div class="t m550 x61 ha y5fa ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Yes,&quot; Anna said, &quot;but I want to be baptized.&quot; </div><div class="t m14 x61 ha y5fb ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;But Anna,&quot; Michelle protested, &quot;you must ask your father.&quot; </div><div class="t mb6 x61 ha y1aa ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;My father knows,&quot; Anna replied, &quot;and he is happy for me.
