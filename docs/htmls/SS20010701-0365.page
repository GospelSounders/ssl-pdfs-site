H. Zachary </div><div class="t m5f5 x66 h11 y774 ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Atheism was the only religion in Froll&apos;s family as he grew up in the </div><div class="t m26f x2d h11 y775 ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">former Soviet Union. When the boy was 5 years old, he became </div><div class="t m5f6 x2d h11 y776 ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">paralyzed. Two surgeries on his spine failed to release him from the </div><div class="t m5f7 x2d h11 y777 ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">paralysis that has left him in a wheelchair. </div><div class="t m5f8 x66 h11 y778 ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">In spite of his lifelong education in atheism, Froll found his think-</div><div class="t m552 x6e h11 y779 ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ing challenged. </div><div class="t m5f9 x73 h11 y5c2 ff7 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">There has to be some sort of intelligent power in the </div><div class="t m5fa x2d h11 y77a ff7 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">universe, </div><div class="t m5fb x47 h11 y70f ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">he reasoned. This conviction grew. &quot;I saw so many evi-</div><div class="t m5fc x2d h11 y710 ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">dences that some Power outside myself was guiding in my life,&quot; he </div><div class="t m54f x2d h11 y77b ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">said. &quot;But I was not brave enough to dismiss the influence of atheism </div><div class="t m18c x2d h11 y77c ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and call this power God.&quot; As he examined the sophistication and </div><div class="t m44d x6e h11 y77d ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">beauty in nature, the argument for a Creator became stronger. </div><div class="t m18f x66 h11 y4b2 ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Froll joined a large and very old Christian denomination and soon </div><div class="t m454 x6e h11 y77e ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was a zealous believer. He longed to meet the Pope, but he had never </div><div class="t m5fd x6e h11 y77f ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ever seen a Bible. </div><div class="t m5fe x66 h11 y780 ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">He became convicted that he was a great sinner and must change his </div><div class="t m5ff x6e h11 y4b6 ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">life. But in spite of his efforts, sin had a strong hold on him. He decided </div><div class="t m600 x6e h11 y781 ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the only way to overcome sin and enter heaven was to become a monk. </div><div class="t m601 x66 h11 y4b8 ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Then a friend gave Froll a New Testament. As he read the Sermon </div><div class="t m51e x6e h11 y4b9 ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">on the Mount, he was overwhelmed by an even greater sense of his </div><div class="t m602 x6e h11 y4ba ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sinfulness. He became convinced that he would spend eternity in hell. </div><div class="t m603 x75 h11 y782 ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Froll met some Adventists. These new friends showed him that </div><div class="t m604 x6e h11 y783 ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Jesus, the sinless One, was the only One who could save him. Froll </div><div class="t m215 x6e h11 y784 ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">began studying the Bible in earnest and realized that what his church </div><div class="t m605 x6e h11 y785 ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">taught differed from what the Bible teaches. There followed a terrible </div><div class="t m606 x6e h11 y786 ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">struggle in his mind, for he did not want to leave his church. </div><div class="t m1bd x75 h11 y787 ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Froll was at a spiritual crossroads. He began praying earnestly. </div><div class="t m607 x6e h11 y788 ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Lord, I have so many questions. If You can answer my questions, </div><div class="t m21d x6e h11 y5e ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">then I will follow the Bible as Luther did.&quot; He promised God that he </div><div class="t m608 x6e h11 y789 ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">would visit the Adventist church with his friends. If he found answers </div><div class="t m5f6 x6e h11 y2e5 ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to his list of questions, then he would know that this was the church </div><div class="t m609 x6e h11 y78a ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">God wanted him to be a part of. He entered the church and settled in </div><div class="t m240 x6e h11 y78b ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">with his list of questions. He was amazed as the pastor answered each </div><div class="t m60a x52 h11 y78c ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of his questions from the Bible. </div><div class="t m60b x75 h11 y78d ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">True to his promise, Froll began attending the Adventist church and </div><div class="t m60c x52 h11 y78e ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">preparing for baptism.
