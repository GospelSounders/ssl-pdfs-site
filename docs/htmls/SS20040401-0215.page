He said that God is more power-</div><div class="t m20f x8f hf y1d7 ff3 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ful than your spirit.&quot; </div><div class="t m210 x85 hf y1d8 ff3 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Ravel sat thinking for a long time after his visitor had left. He had inher-</div><div class="t m211 x8f hf y1d9 ff3 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ited a familiar spirit from his father, who was a witch doctor. Ravel could </div><div class="t m206 x8f hf y1da ff3 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">summon people to come to him without speaking a word. And if someone </div><div class="t m212 x8f hf y1db ff3 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was coming to him whom he did not want to see, he could hold out his </div><div class="t m213 x8f hf y1dc ff3 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">stick and force a person to turn away, even if the person was still a mile or </div><div class="t m214 x8f hf y1dd ff3 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">more away. Ravel never used his powers to hurt anyone; he thought his </div><div class="t m175 x8f hf y1de ff3 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">powers were from God. </div><div class="t m51 x36 hf y1df ff3 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">But when the young man told him that the Adventist preacher said his </div><div class="t m215 x8f hf y1e0 ff3 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">powers were from the devil, Ravel decided to attend the preacher&apos;s meet-</div><div class="t m17f x8f hf y1e1 ff3 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ings and learn for himself where his powers came from. </div><div class="t m1d7 x36 hf y1e2 ff3 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Ravel attended every meeting and talked to the pastor about the previ-</div><div class="t m216 x8f hf y1e3 ff3 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ous night&apos;s sermon. Soon Ravel was convinced that his power was not </div><div class="t m1d7 x8f hf y1e4 ff3 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">from God, but from the devil. He invited the pastor to come to his house </div><div class="t m217 x8f hf y1cc ff3 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and burn his fetishes. The powers Ravel had used were strong, but he knew </div><div class="t m218 x8f hf y1e5 ff3 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that God was stronger. He prayed that God would overpower the demons </div><div class="t m1e1 x8f hf y1e6 ff3 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and send them away, then invited the Holy Spirit to enter his home and </div><div class="t m33 x8f hf y1e7 ff3 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">bless him. </div><div class="t m219 x36 hf y1e8 ff3 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Word spread quickly throughout the area that Ravel had given up his </div><div class="t mdd x1a hf y1e9 ff3 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">fetishes and become an Adventist. He had served the spirits for more than </div><div class="t ma9 x1a hf y1ea ff3 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">50 years, but from that day on, he determined to serve only God. &quot;I want </div><div class="t m202 x1a hf y1eb ff3 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to make up for the time I lived in darkness,&quot; Ravel said simply. The testi-</div><div class="t m21a x1a hf yfc ff3 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">mony of this illiterate, former witch doctor has been a powerful influence </div><div class="t m21b x1a hf yfd ff3 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in the village where he lives.

Ravel prays that God will </div><div class="t m21e x6d hf y1ef ff3 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">use the time he has left to lead others out of </div><div class="t m5a x6d hf y1f0 ff3 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">darkness and into God&apos;s bright and powerful </div><div class="t m21f x6d hf y1f1 ff3 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">light. </div><div class="t m220 x90 h9 y1f2 ff1 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">RAVEL ONATOANDRO </div><div class="t m221 x81 h38 y1f2 ff1 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">(left) </div><div class="t m222 x91 h38 y1f2 ff4 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">is </div><div class="t m223 x92 h38 y1f2 ff1 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">a </div><div class="t m194 x93 h2 y1f2 ff2 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">church elder in </div><div class="t m224 x90 h2 y1f3 ff2 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Madagascar. </div><div class="t m225 x1a h16 y1f4 ff6 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Produced by the General Conference Sabbath School and Personal Ministries Dept. </div><div class="t m226 x1a h16 y1f5 ff6 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Email:gomission@gc.adventist.org </div><div class="t ma x94 h16 y1f5 ff6 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">î˜‰</div><div class="t m227 x1b h39 y1f6 ff6 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">/ </div><div class="t m228 x7d hf y1f7 ff3 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">3 </div></div><div class="pi" data-data='{"ctm":[1.000000,0.000000,0.000000,1.000000,0.000000,0.000000]}'></div></div>
