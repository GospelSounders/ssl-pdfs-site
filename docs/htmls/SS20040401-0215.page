He said that God is more power-</div><div class="t m20f x90 h11 y1d8 ff3 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ful than your spirit.&quot; </div><div class="t m210 x86 h11 y1d9 ff3 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Ravel sat thinking for a long time after his visitor had left. He had inher-</div><div class="t m211 x90 h11 y1da ff3 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ited a familiar spirit from his father, who was a witch doctor. Ravel could </div><div class="t m206 x90 h11 y1db ff3 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">summon people to come to him without speaking a word. And if someone </div><div class="t m212 x90 h11 y1dc ff3 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was coming to him whom he did not want to see, he could hold out his </div><div class="t m213 x90 h11 y1dd ff3 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">stick and force a person to turn away, even if the person was still a mile or </div><div class="t m214 x90 h11 y1de ff3 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">more away. Ravel never used his powers to hurt anyone; he thought his </div><div class="t m175 x90 h11 y1df ff3 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">powers were from God. </div><div class="t m51 x37 h11 y1e0 ff3 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">But when the young man told him that the Adventist preacher said his </div><div class="t m215 x90 h11 y1e1 ff3 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">powers were from the devil, Ravel decided to attend the preacher&apos;s meet-</div><div class="t m17f x90 h11 y1e2 ff3 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ings and learn for himself where his powers came from. </div><div class="t m1d7 x37 h11 y1e3 ff3 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Ravel attended every meeting and talked to the pastor about the previ-</div><div class="t m216 x90 h11 y1e4 ff3 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ous night&apos;s sermon. Soon Ravel was convinced that his power was not </div><div class="t m1d7 x90 h11 y1e5 ff3 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">from God, but from the devil. He invited the pastor to come to his house </div><div class="t m217 x90 h11 y1cd ff3 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and burn his fetishes. The powers Ravel had used were strong, but he knew </div><div class="t m218 x90 h11 y1e6 ff3 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that God was stronger. He prayed that God would overpower the demons </div><div class="t m1e1 x90 h11 y1e7 ff3 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and send them away, then invited the Holy Spirit to enter his home and </div><div class="t m33 x90 h11 y1e8 ff3 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">bless him. </div><div class="t m219 x37 h11 y1e9 ff3 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Word spread quickly throughout the area that Ravel had given up his </div><div class="t mdd x1b h11 y1ea ff3 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">fetishes and become an Adventist. He had served the spirits for more than </div><div class="t ma9 x1b h11 y1eb ff3 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">50 years, but from that day on, he determined to serve only God. &quot;I want </div><div class="t m202 x1b h11 y1ec ff3 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to make up for the time I lived in darkness,&quot; Ravel said simply. The testi-</div><div class="t m21a x1b h11 yfd ff3 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">mony of this illiterate, former witch doctor has been a powerful influence </div><div class="t m21b x1b h11 yfe ff3 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in the village where he lives.
