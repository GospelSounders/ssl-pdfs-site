Within a short time, many of </div><div class="t m1e7 x8 h16 y1e3 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">her neighbors had joined her worship group. </div><div class="t m1e8 x10 h16 y1e4 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The Chinese officials and religious authorities began watching </div><div class="t m138 x8 h16 y1e5 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Lin&apos;s activities. As attendance at her weekly meetings climbed to </div><div class="t m1e9 x8 h16 y1e6 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">nearly 100 people, the authorities ordered her to disband the group. </div><div class="t m1ea x8 h16 y1e7 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">She refused, so the police began intimidating those who attended the </div><div class="t m1eb x8 h16 y1e8 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">meetings. &quot;If you keep going to these meetings, we&apos;ll throw you in </div><div class="t m1ec x8 h16 y1e9 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">jail!&quot; they warned. The threats worked, and the attendance at the </div><div class="t m1ed x8 h16 y1ea ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">house-church meetings dropped to about 40. But additional intimida-</div><div class="t m1ee x8 h16 y1eb ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tion had little influence on the remaining believers. </div><div class="t m1ef x2a h16 y1ec ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The authorities decided to jail Lin. But publicly arresting her was </div><div class="t m1f0 x43 h16 y52 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">not so easy. So they persuaded her to come to the police station to fill </div><div class="t m151 x8 h16 y1ed ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">out some paperwork. Once she was at the police station, she was </div><div class="t m1f1 x8 h16 y1ee ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">arrested and jailed without filing charges or going through the proper </div><div class="t m1e5 x43 h16 y1ef ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">channels. </div><div class="t m1f2 x2a h16 y1f0 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The authorities made it difficult for her husband to visit her, and </div><div class="t m1f3 x43 h16 y1f1 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">she was not allowed to have a Bible or any other religious material. </div><div class="t m1f4 x43 h16 y1f2 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">But her husband wrote Bible texts on a blanket and sent it to her. The </div><div class="t m1f5 x43 h16 y1f3 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">officer who delivered the blanket to her had no idea what it contained. </div><div class="t m1f6 x2a h16 y1f4 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">While in jail, Lin made friends with other prisoners. As the months </div><div class="t m1f7 x43 h16 y1f5 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">passed and their relationships deepened, she began sharing her faith. </div><div class="t m1f8 x43 h16 y1f6 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Soon a large number of the prisoners accepted Jesus as their personal </div><div class="t m1f9 x43 h16 y1f7 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Savior and changed their disruptive behavior. </div><div class="t m1fa x2a h16 y1f8 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The authorities had planned to keep Lin in prison for a year, but six </div><div class="t m1fb x43 h16 y1f9 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">months after her arrest she was released. She asked the officer in </div><div class="t m1fc x43 h16 y1fa ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">charge why she was being released halfway through her sentence, and </div><div class="t m1fd x43 h16 y1fb ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">he admitted that if she had stayed in the jail any longer, all the </div><div class="t m16 x43 h16 y1fc ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">prisoners would be converted to Christianity. </div><div class="t m159 x4b h16 y1fd ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Soon after her release the group of believers was meeting in her </div><div class="t m1a4 x71 h16 y1fe ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">home again, and on any given Sabbath at least 50 people attend.
