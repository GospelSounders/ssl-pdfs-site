No public transportation serves the power plant, since </div><div class="t m203 x7c hc y1ef ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">workers ride the company bus to work. She would have to walk several </div><div class="t m204 x85 hc y1f0 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">miles from the highway to the plant, carrying her heavy load.

But since no vehicles passed by her on the road, </div><div class="t m207 x85 hc y1f3 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">she struggled on, stopping often to rest. </div><div class="t m208 x4e hc y1f4 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;I can&apos;t manage this,&quot; she admitted as she set her carton of </div><div class="t m209 x85 hc y1f5 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">books down beside the road. &quot;Lord, please send someone to help </div><div class="t m20a x85 hc y1f6 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">me carry these books.&quot; </div><div class="t m20b x4e hc y1f7 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">A few minutes later a white taxicab appeared and stopped </div><div class="t m20c x85 hc y1f8 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">several feet from her. &quot;Where are you going?&quot; the driver asked. </div><div class="t m20d x4e hc y1f9 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;To the power plant,&quot; she replied as she loaded her carton of books </div><div class="t m20e x85 hc y1fa ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">into the trunk and slid into the cab. In a few minutes the cab stopped at the </div><div class="t m20f x85 hc y1fb ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">gate of the power plant.
