More than likely this </div><div class="t m1e1 x6a h10 y1bd ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was not how David envisioned his son to succeed him, even though </div><div class="t m1e2 x6a h10 y1be ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">great rejoicing erupted in the city (vss. 39, 40). David was able to bring </div><div class="t m1e3 x6a h10 y1bf ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">some personal good out of it, though: &quot; &apos; &quot;Blessed be the Lord God of </div><div class="t m1e4 x6a h10 ycf ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Israel, who has given one to sit on my throne this day, while my eyes see </div><div class="t m1e5 x6a h10 y1c0 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">it!&quot; &apos; &quot; (1 Kings 1:48, NKJV). David was able to see the promise being </div><div class="t m1e6 x6a h10 y1c1 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">fulfilled that God had made long ago to him. No doubt, he viewed this </div><div class="t m1e7 x6a h10 y1c2 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">as another way in which the Lord was being gracious to him. </div><div class="t m1e8 x17 h10 y1c3 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Meanwhile, Adonijah had tried to usurp that throne, not just from </div><div class="t m1bf x6a h10 y1c4 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Solomon but from David, who was still alive and still king when the son </div><div class="t m1e9 x6a h10 y1c5 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">proclaimed &quot;I will be king!&quot; (vs. 5). Thus, this was a coup against the </div><div class="t m1ea x16 h10 y1c6 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">reigning monarch, not just a bid for power between rival contenders. </div><div class="t m1a5 x16 h10 y1c7 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">His was a full-blown revolution in which he had a lot of support, even </div><div class="t m67 x16 h10 y1c8 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">from within the king&apos;s own family (see 1 Kings 1:9). </div><div class="t m1eb x17 h10 y102 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">After his revolt failed, Adonijah obviously felt that he had reason to </div><div class="t m1ec x16 h10 y103 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">fear, now that Solomon was king, which is why he found sanctuary and </div><div class="t mcc x16 h10 y104 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">asylum by taking hold &quot;on the horns of the altar&quot; (vss. 50, 51). Though, </div><div class="t m1ed x16 h10 y1c9 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">perhaps, Solomon could have felt justified in immediately putting to </div><div class="t m1ee x16 h10 y1ca ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">death the one who, more than likely, would have had no qualms about </div><div class="t m1c1 x16 h10 y1cb ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">eliminating him, Solomon, instead, gave him a chance to redeem himself: </div><div class="t m1ef x16 h10 y1cc ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;And Solomon said, If he will shew himself a worthy man, there shall </div><div class="t m1f0 x16 h10 y1cd ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">not an hair of him fall to the earth: but if wickedness shall be found in </div><div class="t m1f1 x16 h10 y1ce ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">him, he shall die. So king Solomon sent, and they brought him down </div><div class="t m1f2 x16 h10 y5b ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">from the altar.
