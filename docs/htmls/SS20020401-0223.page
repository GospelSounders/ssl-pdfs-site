H. Zachary </div><div class="t m334 x31 h15 y369 ff2 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Christopher was in and out of trouble on the New Mexico Navajo </div><div class="t m298 x69 h15 y36a ff2 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">reservation where he grew up. Eventually he ended up on probation. </div><div class="t m335 x1e h15 y36b ff2 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">He decided to enroll in Holbrook Indian School, an Adventist institu-</div><div class="t m336 x69 h15 y36c ff2 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tion that serves Native Americans, in order to straighten himself out. </div><div class="t m337 x67 h15 y36d ff2 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">But Christopher again fell in with the wrong crowd. One of the boys </div><div class="t m338 x69 h15 y36e ff2 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">got the keys to the school vehicles, and one night several boys crept out </div><div class="t m339 x69 h15 y36f ff2 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">a window after the school watchman left and took a joyride in one of </div><div class="t m14b x69 h15 y370 ff2 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the school&apos;s cars. They carefully returned the car to its parking place </div><div class="t m2b6 x1e h15 y371 ff2 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and slipped back into the dormitory before anyone saw them. </div><div class="t m16a x67 h15 y372 ff2 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Emboldened by their success, the boys tried it again the next </div><div class="t m33a x1e h15 y373 ff2 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">night. They drove to a town 30 minutes away from school and again </div><div class="t m33b x1e h15 y374 ff2 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">managed to return the vehicle without being seen. </div><div class="t m272 x67 h15 y375 ff2 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">On the third night they decided to visit Phoenix, more than three </div><div class="t m33a x1e h15 y376 ff2 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">hours away. Although they started out just after midnight, they soon </div><div class="t m33c x1e h15 y377 ff2 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">realized that they had to hurry if they were to be back before </div><div class="t m265 x1e h15 y378 ff2 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">daybreak. They turned around and started for the school. As the 14-</div><div class="t m58 x1e h15 y379 ff2 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">year-old driver sped down the highway to avoid being caught with </div><div class="t m33d x1e h15 y37a ff2 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the car, they were, instead, stopped by a highway patrol officer. </div><div class="t m33e x67 h15 y37b ff2 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The officer called the boys&apos; parents to pick them up at the local jail, </div><div class="t m8c x1e h15 y37c ff2 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and the school dean picked up the vehicle. Since the boys planned to </div><div class="t m1b x1e h15 y37d ff2 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">return the vehicle, the school did not press charges. But three of them </div><div class="t m33f x1e h15 y37e ff2 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">were placed on six months&apos; probation. However, Christopher was </div><div class="t m340 x1e h15 y37f ff2 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">almost 18, and his part in the joyride broke his probation. He was </div><div class="t m341 x1e h15 y380 ff2 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sentenced to spend spring break in a state correctional facility. </div><div class="t m342 x67 h15 y5c ff2 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Christopher missed the school trip, which he had been looking </div><div class="t m343 x1e h15 y381 ff2 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">forward to. But the experience in the correctional facility gave him </div><div class="t m17c x1e h15 y382 ff2 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">time to examine his life and see that he was headed in the wrong </div><div class="t m344 x1e h15 y383 ff2 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">direction. When he was released from the correctional facility, he </div><div class="t m285 x1e h15 y384 ff2 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">returned to the school a different person. He asked for Bible studies </div><div class="t mc9 x1e h15 y385 ff2 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and gave his heart to Jesus. Staff and students rejoiced when, as the </div><div class="t m2cc x1e h15 y386 ff2 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">school year ended, Christopher was baptized. </div><div class="t m262 x1f h15 y387 ff2 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Christopher plans to graduate from Holbrook and go on to college </div><div class="t m345 x1e h15 y64 ff2 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">as the Lord opens the way. &quot;That careless joyride has opened a whole </div><div class="t m346 x1e h15 y388 ff2 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">new life for me,&quot; he says. &quot;I thank Christian teachers for their love </div><div class="t m347 x1e h15 y389 ff2 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and guidance.
