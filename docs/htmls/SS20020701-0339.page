Often </div><div class="t m377 x47 h33 y3f8 ff1 fs1d fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">he felt like one of the demoniacs of Jesus&apos; time. With uncut hair and </div><div class="t m12f x47 h33 y3f9 ff1 fs1d fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">unwashed body, he wandered the streets begging for money to buy </div><div class="t m349 x47 h33 y4e3 ff1 fs1d fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">alcohol. </div><div class="t m46f x45 h33 y3fb ff1 fs1d fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">One day he wandered into an Adventist church.

Gaspar followed Jose </div><div class="t m473 x55 h33 y402 ff1 fs1d fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">home. Jose gave him food and a bath, then started talking to Gaspar </div><div class="t m9c x47 h33 y403 ff1 fs1d fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">about God. When Jose finished, Gaspar said, &quot;What you say is true. </div><div class="t m474 x55 h33 y4e4 ff1 fs1d fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I am going to quit drinking and come to church regularly.

A Bible worker began studying </div><div class="t m422 x55 h33 y40c ff1 fs1d fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">with him.
