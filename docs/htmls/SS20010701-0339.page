H.

But Colin made no decision for Christ at that time. </div><div class="t m30d x66 h11 y44c ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">During the intervening years God saved his life several times. </div><div class="t m44d x6e h11 y4e3 ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Colin recalls how he lost control of his jeep while driving on a lonely </div><div class="t m44e x6e h11 y4e4 ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">road through a steep canyon. The jeep spun around and headed for the </div><div class="t m20e x6e h11 y4e5 ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">cliff and certain death. Then Colin felt someone or something pull </div><div class="t m44f x6e h11 y4e6 ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">him back. </div><div class="t m232 x66 h11 y4e7 ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">On another occasion a gas cylinder exploded in Colin&apos;s auto repair </div><div class="t m450 x6e h11 y4e8 ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">shop, spewing bits of metal through the air. But miraculously none of </div><div class="t m451 x6e h11 y4e9 ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the flying bits struck him or his workers. </div><div class="t m452 x66 h11 yb0 ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">When Colin heard that a foreign evangelist was holding meetings </div><div class="t m264 x6e h11 y4ea ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">near his home, he decided to attend. While attending the meetings </div><div class="t m453 x6e h11 y4eb ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Colin felt the Holy Spirit touch his life, and he and his wife answered </div><div class="t m454 x6e h11 y4ec ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the call and were baptized. </div><div class="t m455 x66 h11 y4ed ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;I owe my life to Jesus,&quot; Colin says. &quot;While I was still a Hindu, He </div><div class="t m1cf x6e h11 y4ee ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">saved me.&quot; In response to God&apos;s providence, Colin has given his </div><div class="t m7b x6e h11 y4ef ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">energies to evangelism. During the week he works in his auto repair </div><div class="t m21f x6e h11 y4f0 ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">shop, but his weekends belong solely to God. </div><div class="t m456 x75 h11 yb8 ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">On Friday afternoon Colin may travel by jeep as far as he can by </div><div class="t m457 x6e h11 yb9 ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">road, then hike an hour just to visit a few isolated Adventists in a remote </div><div class="t m458 x6e h11 y4f1 ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">village. While there he looks for people in need of help or hope. </div><div class="t m29f x75 h11 y4f2 ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">He visits people, makes friends, and gains permission from the </div><div class="t m3a4 x6e h11 y4f3 ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">village chief to hold Bible meetings. But his greatest evangelistic </div><div class="t m459 x6e h11 y4f4 ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">weapon is prayer. </div><div class="t m45a x75 h11 y4f5 ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Through his efforts as a self-supporting missionary, he has won </div><div class="t m45b x52 h11 y4f6 ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">150 people to Christ. But he is quick to give the glory to God. </div><div class="t m1f8 x75 h11 y4f7 ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">While visiting in one village he met Kong Ti Mai, an elderly </div><div class="t m45c x52 h11 y4f8 ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">woman who had not walked for ten years. &quot;Do you believe in Jesus?&quot; </div><div class="t m45d x52 h11 yc2 ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Colin asked her. </div><div class="t m454 x75 h11 yc3 ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Yes, I do,&quot; the elderly woman answered. &quot;Can you pray for me?&quot; </div><div class="t m45e x75 h11 yc4 ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Colin prayed for the woman, and the Lord Jesus answered his </div><div class="t m45f x52 h11 y4f9 ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">prayer. Kong Ti Mai can walk and is able to care for herself; she even </div><div class="t m1d0 x52 h11 y4fa ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">works in the rice fields with her neighbors.
