For centuries many have accepted the doctrine of transub-</div><div class="t m49 x11 h7 y2e7 ff4 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">stantiation. This doctrine teaches that, when the priest pronounces the words </div><div class="t m2ac x11 h7 y2e8 ff4 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of consecration, the substance of the bread and the wine become the phys-</div><div class="t m154 x11 h7 y2e9 ff4 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ical substance of Christ&apos;s body and blood.

By contrast, the Scriptures teach that there was only one </div><div class="t mf4 x11 h7 y9f ff4 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sacrifice for sin. (See Hebrews 7:27; 9:24-28; 10:12.) </div><div class="t m11e x39 h7 y2eb ff4 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Others believe the doctrine of consubstantiation, which teaches that, even </div><div class="t m2ae x11 h7 y2ec ff4 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">though the substance of the bread and wine remains unchanged, the sub-</div><div class="t m106 x11 h7 y2ed ff4 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">stance of Christ&apos;s physical body and blood are added to it.
