THE TEST (Dan. 3:1-18). </div><div class="t m31a x56 h1c y41d ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The forces of good and the forces of evil stand in conflict in this world.

Attempt to Thwart God&apos;s Revealed Purpose (Dan. 3:1-12). </div><div class="t md7 x56 h1c y420 ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">It seems ridiculous for human beings to think that they can oppose the power </div><div class="t md6 x5d h1c y421 ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of God. Yet this happens often. We see it in the case of Nebuchadnezzar. We see </div><div class="t m2ed x5b h1c y422 ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">how opposition arises out of selfish interest. </div><div class="t m13c x56 h1d y27b ff1 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">What was the significance of the image that Nebuchadnezzar erected on </div><div class="t m68 x5b h1d y423 ff1 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the plain of Dura near Babylon? Dan. 3:1-3. </div><div class="t m13f x56 h1c y80 ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">It is almost impossible not to see a link between the image that was set up in </div><div class="t m31c x5d h1c y424 ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Dura and the image the king had seen in his dream. But there was one significant </div><div class="t m31d x5d h1c y425 ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">difference; whereas the image in the dream had been composed of various met-</div><div class="t mdb x5d h1c y426 ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">als, the image set up in the plain was made of one metal—gold.

It had also been pointed out that another kingdom would </div><div class="t m31e x5d h1c y428 ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">succeed Babylon, a kingdom inferior, but nevertheless a different kingdom. </div><div class="t m299 x5d h1c y429 ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Nebuchadnezzar accepted the interpretation of the dream as a supernatural rev-</div><div class="t m31f x5d h1c y42a ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">elation. He recognized the God of Daniel as the great Revealer of secrets. But </div><div class="t m265 x5d h1c y37f ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the concept that another kingdom would succeed his did not please him. </div><div class="t m320 x53 h1c y42b ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">There was nothing secret or hidden about the happenings surrounding the </div><div class="t m2c0 x5d h1c y42c ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">dream and its interpretation. For one thing, all the scholars in Babylon owed </div><div class="t m129 x5d h1c y42d ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">their lives to Daniel and certainly would have been told about his revelation of </div><div class="t m2f7 x5d h1c y42e ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the dream and its meaning to the king. The promotion of Daniel to high office in </div><div class="t m321 x5d h1c y42f ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the land provided abundant evidence that the king had received an answer to his </div><div class="t m275 x5d h1c y430 ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">request. </div><div class="t m16a x5d h1d y431 ff1 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ILLUMINATION: </div><div class="t m241 x24 h1c y432 ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;For a time afterward [after the dream], Nebuchadnezzar </div><div class="t m28c x5d h1c y383 ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was influenced by the fear of God; but his heart was not yet cleansed from </div><div class="t m104 x5d h1c y433 ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">worldly ambition and a desire for self-exaltation. The prosperity attending his </div><div class="t m31c x5d h1c y434 ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">reign filled him with pride. In time he ceased to honor God, and resumed his idol </div><div class="t me3 x5d h1c y384 ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">worship with increased zeal and bigotry. . . . The wise men of his realm, taking </div><div class="t mef x2f h1c y435 ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">advantage of this and of his return to idolatry, proposed that he make an image </div><div class="t m322 x2f h1c y436 ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">similar to the one seen in his dream, and set it up where all might behold the head </div><div class="t m176 x2f h1c y437 ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of gold, which had been interpreted as representing his kingdom. </div><div class="t m31a x53 h1c y438 ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Pleased with the flattering suggestion, he determined to carry it out, and to </div><div class="t m323 x2f h1c y439 ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">go even farther.
