Yet this happens often. We see it in the case of Nebuchadnezzar. We see </div><div class="t m2ed x5a h1e y423 ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">how opposition arises out of selfish interest. </div><div class="t m13c x55 h1f y27c ff1 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">What was the significance of the image that Nebuchadnezzar erected on </div><div class="t m68 x5a h1f y424 ff1 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the plain of Dura near Babylon? Dan. 3:1-3. </div><div class="t m13f x55 h1e y81 ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">It is almost impossible not to see a link between the image that was set up in </div><div class="t m31c x5c h1e y425 ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Dura and the image the king had seen in his dream. But there was one significant </div><div class="t m31d x5c h1e y426 ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">difference; whereas the image in the dream had been composed of various met-</div><div class="t mdb x5c h1e y427 ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">als, the image set up in the plain was made of one metal—gold.

The prosperity attending his </div><div class="t m31c x5c h1e y435 ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">reign filled him with pride.
