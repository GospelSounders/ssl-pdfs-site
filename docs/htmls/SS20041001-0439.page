Michelle silently pleaded. You can&apos;t want to be baptized! The color </div><div class="t ma7 x36 ha y515 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">drained from Michelle&apos;s cheeks, and tears formed in her eyes. What could </div><div class="t m378 x36 ha y516 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">she say to this young girl? </div><div class="t m1ae x82 ha y517 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Sixteen-year-old Anna had matured so much in the three years since her </div><div class="t m4b8 x36 ha y518 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">mother had been—Michelle couldn&apos;t bring herself to form the word—</div><div class="t m29 x36 ha y519 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">since her mother had died. Anna had her mother&apos;s fine features and that </div><div class="t m1f3 x36 ha y51a ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">same peaceful, determined look that her mother, Sofia, had shown when </div><div class="t m36d x36 ha y51b ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">she told Michelle she wanted to give her life to Jesus. </div><div class="t m4b9 x82 ha y51c ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Anna and her brother, Hans, had been attending Michelle&apos;s &quot;English&quot; </div><div class="t m4ba x36 ha y51d ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">classes for children. It was more like a Vacation Bible School, and forty or </div><div class="t m180 x36 ha y51e ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">fifty children had come each week. They came from all backgrounds, and </div><div class="t m40d x21 ha y51f ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">they enjoyed the singing and stories she shared with them. </div><div class="t m14c x82 ha y520 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">When Anna and Hans didn&apos;t show up for two weeks, Michelle began to </div><div class="t m4bb x21 ha y521 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">worry. Her translator seemed hesitant to share with her why the children </div><div class="t m4bc x21 ha y522 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">weren&apos;t coming. Finally Michelle got impatient and said she would go to </div><div class="t m18f x21 ha y93 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the home and talk with the parents herself. </div><div class="t mf0 x82 ha y523 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">A lovely woman met Michelle and her translator at the door. The woman </div><div class="t m4bd x21 ha y95 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">introduced herself as Sofia and invited them in. Michelle noticed a Bible </div><div class="t m4e x21 ha y524 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in the book shelf, and her hopes soared that Sofia was a Christian. But </div><div class="t m375 x21 ha y97 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">when Sofia excused herself and left the room, Michelle could hear angry </div><div class="t m241 x21 ha y98 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">voices in a heated argument. </div><div class="t m4be x1 ha y99 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Sofia seemed pale when she returned to the room with tea. Michelle </div><div class="t m44c x21 ha y9a ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">realized her visit was awkward and not well planned. She had not asked </div><div class="t m4bf x21 ha y525 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">her husband to go with her, and it had further alienated Sofia&apos;s Muslim </div><div class="t m366 x21 ha y526 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">husband. </div><div class="t m4c0 x1 ha y527 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Michelle told Sofia that she enjoyed having Hans and Anna at the </div><div class="t m301 x21 ha y528 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;classes&quot; and hoped they could return.

Sofia began attending the classes with her children. Then one </div><div class="t m4c2 x21 ha y52c ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">day Sofia confided, &quot;Michelle, I love Jesus. I want to give my heart to </div><div class="t m339 x21 ha y52d ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Him. I want to carry my Bible openly, not wrapped up in garbage paper.

But Michelle&apos;s happiness </div><div class="t md7 x21 ha y530 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was short lived. </div><div class="t m3a xba ha y531 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">(continued next week) </div><div class="t m4aa x9c hc y532 ff2 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Homer Trecartin is Secretary-Treasurer of the Middle East Union in Nicosia, Cyprus.
