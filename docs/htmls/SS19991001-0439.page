Jerry Fernandez was </div><div class="t m409 x4f hd y28c ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">assigned to a large church near the campus. Although the church </div><div class="t m40a x1c hd y479 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">had four hundred members, it was not growing. </div><div class="t m26a x56 hd y453 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">As Thirteenth Sabbath approached, Jerry prepared for the Com-</div><div class="t m6b x1c hd y454 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">munion service. He learned that two of the local elders were in-</div><div class="t m40b x1c hd y455 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">volved in a dispute over a strip of land that lay between their farms. </div><div class="t m2f7 x1c hd y456 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The disagreement had become heated, and one man called the other </div><div class="t m25f x1c hd y457 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">a liar and a thief. The second man stopped attending church. How </div><div class="t m40c x1c hd y4c ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">could he worship with the man who had attacked him? </div><div class="t m40d x4e hd y47a ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Jerry felt that he had to visit the men. But he was barely twenty </div><div class="t m3ba x1c hd y458 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">years old, and the two men were in their sixties. Jeny knew that he </div><div class="t m390 x1c hd y459 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">needed the help of the Holy Spirit in order to reconcile these brothers. </div><div class="t m40e x56 hd y47b ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Jerry visited the first elder and counseled him to surrender the </div><div class="t m34e x1c hd y47c ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">disputed land to his neighbor and to wash his brother&apos;s feet on </div><div class="t m40f x1c hd y71 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Sabbath. Finally the elder agreed. &quot;Jesus will be waiting for you at </div><div class="t m32c x1c hd y47d ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">church,&quot; Jerry promised. </div><div class="t m410 x8d hd y45b ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Then Jerry visited the second man and made a similar appeal. </div><div class="t m126 x1c hd y47e ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">But the man resisted, &quot;He called me a liar and a thief! He should </div><div class="t m411 x1c hd y45d ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">make this right first.&quot; Jerry gently pleaded with the man to forgive </div><div class="t m412 x1c hd y47f ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">his brother and come to the Communion service. &quot;Jesus wants you </div><div class="t m2d3 x1c hd y45f ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to come,&quot; Jerry said. But the man would not promise. </div><div class="t m6a x8d hd yf1 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">On Sabbath morning Jerry hiked the three miles to his church. </div><div class="t m169 x1c hd y480 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">He found the first elder waiting for him. But as time for church </div><div class="t m2a4 x1c hd y214 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">neared, Jerry became concerned. The second elder had not come. </div><div class="t m122 x8d hd y460 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Jerry borrowed a bicycle and rode to the home of the second </div><div class="t m413 x1c hd y461 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">elder. &quot;Brother,&quot; he pleaded, &quot;we are waiting for you. Today is the </div><div class="t m201 x1c hd y462 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">day to make things right.&quot; The older man repeated his reasons for </div><div class="t m33 x1c hd y463 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">not coming, but Jerry kindly persisted. &quot;The Lord Jesus will be </div><div class="t m186 x1c hd y68 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">disappointed if you do not come.&quot; </div><div class="t m368 x8d hd y481 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Finally the elder agreed. The man got on the bicycle, and Jerry </div><div class="t m3ff x71 hd y482 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">pedaled back to the church. When they arrived, Jerry took the two </div><div class="t m1fe x71 hd y464 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">men into the banana patch behind the church. While the two men </div><div class="t m27a x71 hd y465 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">faced each other, Jerry took their hands and prayed for them. </div><div class="t m414 x25 hd y466 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The reconciliation sparked a revival in the church, and soon the </div><div class="t m415 x71 hd y467 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">church was crowded with worshipers. The congregation built a </div><div class="t m278 x71 hd y483 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">larger church around the old building. The membership continues </div><div class="t m30c x71 hd y484 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to grow, in part because of a peacemaking young pastor. </div><div class="t m416 x25 h30 y485 ff4 fs20 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">J.
