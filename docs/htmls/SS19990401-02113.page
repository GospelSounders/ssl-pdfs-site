One man, Mircea Gainescu, agreed to invite some </div><div class="t m348 x5e hb y6e9 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">friends, but during the week he became busy with work and other </div><div class="t m4ad x16 hb y469 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">activities and forgot his promise. </div><div class="t m3ad x49 hb y46a ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">His pastor asked a second time, but the pressures of family and </div><div class="t m3b4 x5e hb y146 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">work crowded the promise from his mind, and the week slipped by </div><div class="t m2ca x5e hb y118 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">before he remembered to invite someone. </div><div class="t m12d x49 hb y82a ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">On Friday night Brother Gainescu had a dream.

As </div><div class="t m4cc x5e hb y6cc ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">he looked, a stranger approached the gate. Gainescu noted that he </div><div class="t m5b6 x5e hb y82c ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was short and thin with curly hair. The stranger stopped and asked </div><div class="t m546 x5e hb y82d ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Gainescu if he could go to church with him. </div><div class="t m2f5 x49 hb y82e ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Gainescu woke up and remembered his promise to invite people </div><div class="t m78c x5e hb y6cd ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to the meetings.

Following Bible studies he was </div><div class="t m2b1 xd hb y12c ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">baptized. </div><div class="t m33 x29 hb y12f ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">After his baptism he invited his neighbors to come to his home </div><div class="t m3c2 xd hb y267 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to study the Bible.
