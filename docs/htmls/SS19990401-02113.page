One man, Mircea Gainescu, agreed to invite some </div><div class="t m348 x5d h9 y6e8 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">friends, but during the week he became busy with work and other </div><div class="t m4ad x15 h9 y468 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">activities and forgot his promise. </div><div class="t m3ad x48 h9 y469 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">His pastor asked a second time, but the pressures of family and </div><div class="t m3b4 x5d h9 y145 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">work crowded the promise from his mind, and the week slipped by </div><div class="t m2ca x5d h9 y117 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">before he remembered to invite someone. </div><div class="t m12d x48 h9 y829 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">On Friday night Brother Gainescu had a dream.

As </div><div class="t m4cc x5d h9 y6cb ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">he looked, a stranger approached the gate. Gainescu noted that he </div><div class="t m5b6 x5d h9 y82b ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was short and thin with curly hair. The stranger stopped and asked </div><div class="t m546 x5d h9 y82c ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Gainescu if he could go to church with him. </div><div class="t m2f5 x48 h9 y82d ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Gainescu woke up and remembered his promise to invite people </div><div class="t m78c x5d h9 y6cc ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to the meetings.
