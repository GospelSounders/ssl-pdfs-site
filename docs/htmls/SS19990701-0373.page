They had terrorized the region so </div><div class="t m2a2 x26 h1d y780 ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">much that the community nearly became a ghost town. </div><div class="t m315 x21 h1d y781 ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Finally the police caught Abel and sent him to prison. He was </div><div class="t m5dc x26 h1d y782 ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">assigned to work six days a week with Sundays off. But Abel noticed </div><div class="t m70 x26 h1d y783 ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that some prisoners did not work on Saturdays or Sundays. He </div><div class="t m51d x26 h1d y784 ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">learned that they were Sabbath keepers. Abel was jealous and </div><div class="t m5ec x26 h1d y785 ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">decided to claim to be a Sabbath keeper so that he too could get </div><div class="t m391 x26 h1d y786 ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Saturdays off. It worked, and he wanted to use his free day to sleep, </div><div class="t m609 x73 h1d y787 ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">but he feared that the guards might notice and send him back to work. </div><div class="t m561 x73 h1d y788 ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">So he decided to attend the Sabbath worship services instead. </div><div class="t m60a x21 h1d y789 ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Then Abel escaped from prison. With two of his former gang </div><div class="t m395 x73 h1d y78a ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">members, he fled into the jungle. The trio built a bush house for </div><div class="t m113 x73 h1d y78b ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">themselves and dug a tunnel under their home as an escape route </div><div class="t m4e7 x73 h1d y78c ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">should police find them. </div><div class="t m38d x23 h1d y78d ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">While they worked, Abel did some serious thinking. One day he </div><div class="t m102 x73 h1d y78e ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">told his friends, &quot;We are not living right. We have hurt people; we </div><div class="t mff x73 h1d y78f ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">are always running from the law. We need to change our ways.&quot; </div><div class="t m321 x21 h1d y790 ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;What do you have in mind?&quot; one of his friends asked. </div><div class="t m13e x23 h1d y1d7 ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;We should attend church.
