School officials </div><div class="t m44d x91 h29 y8b9 ff3 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">purchased land to build a new campus, but found squatters had </div><div class="t m41c x91 h29 y8ba ff3 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">settled on the land. The school offered the squatters a piece of </div><div class="t m7b0 x91 h29 y8bb ff3 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">property and money to build new homes. A village grew up on </div><div class="t m7fc x91 h29 y8bc ff3 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the new land. </div><div class="t m7fd x8 h29 y8bd ff3 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The villagers were farmers, and seasonal work did not pay </div><div class="t m4fd x91 h29 y8be ff3 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">well. When they saw new buildings on their former farmland, </div><div class="t m758 x74 h29 y8bf ff3 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">they decided the new owners were rich, and they began stealing </div><div class="t m6f4 x74 h29 y8c0 ff3 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">from the school. Theft got so bad that the school hired guards </div><div class="t m7fe x74 h29 y8c1 ff3 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to patrol the campus. Tensions between the school and the </div><div class="t m7ff x74 h29 y8c2 ff3 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">villagers grew. How could the school hold up the banner of </div><div class="t m4e6 x74 h29 y8c3 ff3 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">God&apos;s love and protect it&apos;s valuables at the same time? </div><div class="t m800 x8 h29 y8c4 ff3 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Then ADRA sent some trainees into the village. They </div><div class="t m801 x74 h29 y8c5 ff3 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">talked about problems, cleaned the village, built latrines, and </div><div class="t m36b x74 h29 y8c6 ff3 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">provided immunizations for the children. But the village&apos;s </div><div class="t m6f8 x74 h29 y8c7 ff3 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">biggest problem was hunger. Students asked the school if the </div><div class="t m78e x74 h29 y8c8 ff3 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">villagers could plow an unused corner of the campus to grow </div><div class="t m802 x74 h29 y8c9 ff3 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">vegetables. The administration, seeing the chance to improve </div><div class="t m36 x74 h29 y40 ff3 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">relations with the villagers, agreed. </div><div class="t m497 x34 h29 y8ca ff3 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Later, ADRA wanted to teach trainees gardening and water </div><div class="t m803 x74 h29 y8cb ff3 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">development. The project leader suggested drilling a well in </div><div class="t m804 x74 h29 y8cc ff3 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the villagers&apos; garden to help increase their growing season. </div><div class="t m20 x74 h29 y8cd ff3 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Villagers watched as the team started drilling. By late Thurs-</div><div class="t m337 x74 h29 y8ce ff3 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">day they hit water. However, they couldn&apos;t finish drilling until </div><div class="t m805 x74 h29 y8cf ff3 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Sunday. Did they dare leave the portable well-driller un-</div><div class="t m7d1 x74 h29 y8d0 ff3 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">guarded in the villagers&apos; garden—the same villagers who had </div><div class="t m406 x74 h29 y8d1 ff3 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">stolen supplies from the school? </div><div class="t m75e x34 h29 yd7 ff3 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The project leader begged the school to leave the well driller </div><div class="t m75c x26 h29 y8d2 ff3 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in the garden. &quot;Think of the negative message you will send if </div><div class="t m5b0 x26 h29 y8d3 ff3 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">you guard it,&quot; he said.
