He is a member of </div><div class="t m83 x9 hd y884 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the Dungan race, an ethnic group that dates back to the seventh </div><div class="t m642 x2 hd y885 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">century, when Arabs intermarried with Chinese. The children of these </div><div class="t m194 x9 hd y886 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">marriages took their father&apos;s religion, Islam, and their mother&apos;s lan-</div><div class="t m33b x9 hd y887 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">guage, a dialect of Chinese.

Members of his family </div><div class="t m24c x9 hd y88a ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">are priests, and he, too, studied in the Muslim seminary. He has </div><div class="t m2a0 x9 hd y128 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">studied the Qu&apos;ran for years and knows it well. But in spite of this, he </div><div class="t m3fc x9 hd y4c ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">knew no peace. His spiritual hunger and inquiring mind drove him to </div><div class="t m214 x9 hd y88b ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">search for answers. He decided to compare his religion with Christian-</div><div class="t m5f9 x9 hd y88c ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ity and learn about this God-Man, Jesus. </div><div class="t m643 x20 hd y88d ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">He met a Protestant pastor, and for two years he attended worship </div><div class="t m644 x9 hd y88e ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">services in both the Christian church and the mosque. During this time </div><div class="t m645 x9 hd y88f ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">he says he felt like a spy. He compared the Bible with the Qu&apos;ran. He </div><div class="t m41c x9 hd y890 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">found a peace and comfort from studying the Bible that he had not </div><div class="t m5b7 x9 hd y891 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">found in following the traditions of Islam. </div><div class="t m21c x20 hd y892 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">During this time an Adventist evangelist announced meetings in </div><div class="t m646 x9 hd y893 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">town. Roman read the brochure and decided to attend. Cautiously he </div><div class="t m12e x9 hd y894 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">studied the Adventist doctrines. To his joy, he found that Adventist </div><div class="t m647 x9 hd y895 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">health teachings were very similar to his Muslim beliefs and practices. </div><div class="t m1ff x9 hd y896 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">And he found similarities in teachings about end-time events as well. </div><div class="t m648 x20 hd y897 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Roman surrendered his life to Christ and was baptized. In doing so, </div><div class="t m5bf x9 hd y898 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">he became the first ethnic Dungan to become a Seventh-day Adventist. </div><div class="t m5b8 x20 hd y899 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">He did not make this decision lightly, for he knew that such a </div><div class="t m372 x9 hd y89a ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">decision would mean total separation from his family, who would </div><div class="t m1ff x36 hd y89b ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">consider him a traitor to his faith. </div><div class="t m265 xc hd y89c ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Roman changed more than his faith; </div><div class="t m2d2 x3f hd y89d ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">he changed careers.
