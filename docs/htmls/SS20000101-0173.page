He is a member of </div><div class="t m83 x8 hb y883 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the Dungan race, an ethnic group that dates back to the seventh </div><div class="t m642 x1 hb y884 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">century, when Arabs intermarried with Chinese.

Members of his family </div><div class="t m24c x8 hb y889 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">are priests, and he, too, studied in the Muslim seminary. He has </div><div class="t m2a0 x8 hb y127 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">studied the Qu&apos;ran for years and knows it well. But in spite of this, he </div><div class="t m3fc x8 hb y4b ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">knew no peace. His spiritual hunger and inquiring mind drove him to </div><div class="t m214 x8 hb y88a ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">search for answers. He decided to compare his religion with Christian-</div><div class="t m5f9 x8 hb y88b ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ity and learn about this God-Man, Jesus. </div><div class="t m643 x1f hb y88c ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">He met a Protestant pastor, and for two years he attended worship </div><div class="t m644 x8 hb y88d ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">services in both the Christian church and the mosque. During this time </div><div class="t m645 x8 hb y88e ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">he says he felt like a spy. He compared the Bible with the Qu&apos;ran.

To his joy, he found that Adventist </div><div class="t m647 x8 hb y894 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">health teachings were very similar to his Muslim beliefs and practices. </div><div class="t m1ff x8 hb y895 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">And he found similarities in teachings about end-time events as well. </div><div class="t m648 x1f hb y896 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Roman surrendered his life to Christ and was baptized.
