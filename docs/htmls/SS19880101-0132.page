It symbolizes the death of the Passover Lamb on the cross, but it </div><div class="t m3f2 x75 h17 y49b ff2 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">also points forward to the coming of the Lamb of God the second time to </div><div class="t m3f3 x75 h17 y49c ff2 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">give final freedom to His people. At the cross the Lamb overcame Satan and </div><div class="t m3f4 x75 h17 y49d ff2 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">victory was assured. (See Heb. 2:14, 15.) But the freedom won there will </div><div class="t m77 x75 h17 y1ee ff2 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">not be realized in its fullness until He comes in glory. </div><div class="t m332 x3a h17 y49e ff2 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Taking the unleavened bread and the unfermented wine, Jesus said, </div><div class="t m331 x75 h17 y49f ff2 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;This is my body which is broken for you, . . . my blood which is shed for </div><div class="t mf0 x75 h17 y4a0 ff2 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">you&quot; (1 Cor. 11:19, 20). In this way, the Lord took the familiar symbols of </div><div class="t m3f5 x75 h17 y1f2 ff2 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the Passover and filled them with fresh meaning.
