It symbolizes the death of the Passover Lamb on the cross, but it </div><div class="t m3f2 x74 h15 y49a ff2 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">also points forward to the coming of the Lamb of God the second time to </div><div class="t m3f3 x74 h15 y49b ff2 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">give final freedom to His people. At the cross the Lamb overcame Satan and </div><div class="t m3f4 x74 h15 y49c ff2 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">victory was assured. (See Heb. 2:14, 15.) But the freedom won there will </div><div class="t m77 x74 h15 y1ed ff2 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">not be realized in its fullness until He comes in glory. </div><div class="t m332 x39 h15 y49d ff2 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Taking the unleavened bread and the unfermented wine, Jesus said, </div><div class="t m331 x74 h15 y49e ff2 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;This is my body which is broken for you, . . . my blood which is shed for </div><div class="t mf0 x74 h15 y49f ff2 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">you&quot; (1 Cor. 11:19, 20). In this way, the Lord took the familiar symbols of </div><div class="t m3f5 x74 h15 y1f1 ff2 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the Passover and filled them with fresh meaning. He transformed the Pass-</div><div class="t m3f6 x74 h15 y4a0 ff2 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">over into a new service celebrating the saving work of the Passover Lamb. </div><div class="t m198 x74 h15 y2de ff2 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The disciples did not fully understand His words that evening, but they came </div><div class="t md9 x74 h15 y4a1 ff2 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to realize their significance later. </div><div class="t m3f7 x39 h1b y4a2 ff1 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">What did Jesus mean when He said in John 6:54, &quot;Whoso eateth my </div><div class="t m1cc x74 h1b y4a3 ff1 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">flesh, and drinketh my blood, hath eternal life&quot;? </div><div class="t m3f8 x39 h15 y4a4 ff2 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">This symbolism can be applied to participating in the Lord&apos;s Supper. </div><div class="t ma6 x74 h15 y4a5 ff2 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">When we do, we reaffirm our decision to accept Jesus&apos; death as our own.
