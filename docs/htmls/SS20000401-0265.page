I explained that some-</div><div class="t med x21 hc y54b ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">times we need to get personal, even go into the audience to encour-</div><div class="t m5b4 x21 hc y54c ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">age one with whom we have been working to make that decision </div><div class="t m1d0 x21 hc y54d ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">for baptism. </div><div class="t m469 x22 hc y54e ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">As I spoke I walked into the group of lay workers and ap-</div><div class="t m45f x79 hc y54f ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">proached one young woman. I looked into her eyes and said, &quot;You </div><div class="t m3a1 x79 hc y550 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">know, this may be the time that God has chosen for you to decide </div><div class="t m213 x79 hc y110 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">for Christ. Don&apos;t take a chance on waiting. Come, God loves you; </div><div class="t m2f0 x21 hc y551 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">all of us love you. We want you in God&apos;s kingdom. Come.&quot; </div><div class="t m1d0 x22 hc y553 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">With those words, I took her arm and invited her to walk to the </div><div class="t m5b5 x79 hc y554 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">front of the room with me. She walked with me to the front. After I </div><div class="t m5ab x79 hc y712 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">closed my demonstration call with prayer, I thanked her, and she </div><div class="t m5b6 x79 hc y556 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">returned to her seat. Throughout the demonstration the young </div><div class="t m1b3 x79 hc y557 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">woman had said nothing. </div><div class="t m190 x1e hc y558 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I continued with class. During our noon break several people </div><div class="t m74 x79 hc y4c0 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">came to talk to me. This girl stood a few feet away but left before I </div><div class="t m16b x79 hc y27a ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">could speak with her. Later one of the other students came to me </div><div class="t m1d8 x79 hc y559 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and told me that the girl with whom I had made the appeal had </div><div class="t m5e x79 hc y55a ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">confided in him that she wanted to be baptized on Sabbath. </div><div class="t m4d6 x1e hc y55b ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I learned that this young girl had grown up in an Adventist </div><div class="t m5b7 x79 hc y713 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">home but had never made her decision to be baptized. But during </div><div class="t m5a1 x79 hc y55d ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">my call, the call that I thought was only a demonstration, she felt </div><div class="t m5b8 x79 hc y55e ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">God speaking directly to her. </div><div class="t m4a3 x1e hc y55f ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Later that day I spoke with her.

No one except God. God directed you to approach me </div><div class="t m34e x1a hc y560 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">rather than someone else.&quot; </div><div class="t m3b0 x1e hc y561 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">We made arrangements to close the training class with a bap-</div><div class="t m427 x1a hc y562 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tism on Sabbath afternoon.
