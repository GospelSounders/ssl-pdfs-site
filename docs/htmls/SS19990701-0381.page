After escaping from prison, he and two former gang members </div><div class="t m9d x26 h1d y7d3 ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">fled into the jungle. As Abel thought about his past, he decided that </div><div class="t m650 x26 h1d y7d4 ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">they needed to change their lives. It was not safe to visit the church in </div><div class="t m91 x26 h1d y7d5 ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the valley, so the men built their own church. </div><div class="t m331 x27 h1d y7d6 ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;What do we do now that we have a church?&quot; one man asked. </div><div class="t m62f x27 h1d y7d7 ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;We will hold services on Saturday, as the Adventists in prison </div><div class="t m158 x26 h1d y7d8 ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">did,&quot; Abel answered.

After worship he invited the youth to come every week. They </div><div class="t m509 x26 h1d y7e0 ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">happily agreed. </div><div class="t m5fb x21 h1d y7e1 ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The following Sabbath, when the students had not arrived by </div><div class="t m2c x26 h1d y7e2 ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">11:00, Abel was worried. He asked a man walking along the path, </div><div class="t m624 x26 h1d y7e3 ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Did you see the Adventist young people who are supposed to come </div><div class="t m45b x26 h1d y6b3 ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">today?&quot; </div><div class="t m36d x21 h1d y7e4 ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The man answered, &quot;They aren&apos;t coming. The school principal </div><div class="t m101 x26 h1d y7e5 ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">won&apos;t let them leave the campus.&quot; </div><div class="t m592 x21 h1d y7e6 ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Angry, Abel picked up his rifle and headed for the school. He </div><div class="t m583 x73 h1d y7e7 ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">fired shots into the air, frightening the villagers who ran for cover. </div><div class="t m554 x73 h1d y4d ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">When Abel arrived at the school, the gate was padlocked. He shot </div><div class="t m1c6 x73 h1d y6b7 ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">open the lock and walked in, demanding to see the principal. When </div><div class="t m4be x73 h1d y6e1 ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">he found the man, Abel aimed his rifle at the man&apos;s head. </div><div class="t m652 x21 h1d y7e8 ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;What do you want?&quot; the principal stammered. </div><div class="t m22a x21 h1d y7e9 ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Let the Adventist young people come to my church!&quot; Abel </div><div class="t m555 x73 h1d y7ea ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ordered. The principal agreed, and the youth again worshiped with </div><div class="t mcf x73 h1d y7eb ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the three men in the jungle chapel. The Holy Spirit softened their </div><div class="t m515 x73 h1d y7ec ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">hearts, and the three men surrendered their lives to God. </div><div class="t m1c9 x23 h1d y7ed ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Soon the little bush chapel was too small to hold all the people </div><div class="t m122 x73 h1d y6e6 ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">who wanted to worship there. Abel and his friends have built a larger </div><div class="t m332 x73 h1d y7ee ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">church. One of the former convicts serves as head elder, and Abel </div><div class="t m3f x73 h1d y7ef ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">leads the Pathfinders.
