One day as she prayed for guidance, a </div><div class="t m2de xb h15 y34f ff2 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">knock at the door interrupted her prayer. Opening the door, she </div><div class="t m2df xb h15 y350 ff2 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">found several people standing there—Adventists who had come </div><div class="t m2e0 xb h15 y351 ff2 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to invite her to church. Mrs. Chung attended their church, but </div><div class="t m2e1 xb h15 y352 ff2 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">hesitated to join the Adventist Church. </div><div class="t m4b x40 h15 y353 ff2 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">However, she felt no peace; her life seemed empty and mean-</div><div class="t m2e2 xb h15 y354 ff2 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ingless. One night, feeling she had reached a new low point, she </div><div class="t m2e3 xb h15 y355 ff2 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">confessed her sins and promised to follow the Lord wherever He </div><div class="t m2e4 xb h15 y356 ff2 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">led. At dawn she went to the Adventist church to pray. There she </div><div class="t m2e5 xb h15 y357 ff2 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">found assurance that God had accepted her. She began attending </div><div class="t m2e6 xb h15 y358 ff2 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the Adventist church regularly, and was baptized in May 1993. </div><div class="t m14b x85 h15 y359 ff2 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Her one goal became to share Jesus with others. She started </div><div class="t m47 xb h15 y35a ff2 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">giving Bible studies to a neighbor couple. What a joy she felt </div><div class="t m2e7 xb h15 y35b ff2 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">when these friends were baptized! </div><div class="t m2e8 x85 h15 y35c ff2 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">But her greatest burdens were for her husband and her mother. </div><div class="t m2e9 xb h15 y35d ff2 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Her husband never attended church and had some unhealthful </div><div class="t m4b xb h15 y35e ff2 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">habits.
