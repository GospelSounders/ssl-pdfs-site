One day as she prayed for guidance, a </div><div class="t m2de xa h11 y34e ff2 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">knock at the door interrupted her prayer. Opening the door, she </div><div class="t m2df xa h11 y34f ff2 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">found several people standing there—Adventists who had come </div><div class="t m2e0 xa h11 y350 ff2 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to invite her to church. Mrs. Chung attended their church, but </div><div class="t m2e1 xa h11 y351 ff2 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">hesitated to join the Adventist Church. </div><div class="t m4b x3f h11 y352 ff2 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">However, she felt no peace; her life seemed empty and mean-</div><div class="t m2e2 xa h11 y353 ff2 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ingless. One night, feeling she had reached a new low point, she </div><div class="t m2e3 xa h11 y354 ff2 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">confessed her sins and promised to follow the Lord wherever He </div><div class="t m2e4 xa h11 y355 ff2 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">led. At dawn she went to the Adventist church to pray. There she </div><div class="t m2e5 xa h11 y356 ff2 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">found assurance that God had accepted her. She began attending </div><div class="t m2e6 xa h11 y357 ff2 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the Adventist church regularly, and was baptized in May 1993. </div><div class="t m14b x84 h11 y358 ff2 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Her one goal became to share Jesus with others. She started </div><div class="t m47 xa h11 y359 ff2 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">giving Bible studies to a neighbor couple. What a joy she felt </div><div class="t m2e7 xa h11 y35a ff2 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">when these friends were baptized! </div><div class="t m2e8 x84 h11 y35b ff2 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">But her greatest burdens were for her husband and her mother. </div><div class="t m2e9 xa h11 y35c ff2 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Her husband never attended church and had some unhealthful </div><div class="t m4b xa h11 y35d ff2 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">habits.
