Nearly every family has at least one idol niche </div><div class="t m188 x3e h11 yb89 ff2 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in its home. It is hard to find a Christian church in Chia-yi, and </div><div class="t m249 x3e h11 y954 ff2 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">missionaries who have gone there have often left, disappointed. </div><div class="t m6a2 xf h11 y955 ff2 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">In 1993 a Global Mission team entered Chia-yi. We bought a </div><div class="t m6a3 x3e h11 yb8a ff2 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">four-story building to use as a church. Two big temples stand in </div><div class="t m327 x3e h11 y957 ff2 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">front and back of our new church. A few Adventists moved to </div><div class="t m642 x3e h11 y63a ff2 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Chia-yi to strengthen the work there. And God blessed us. As a </div><div class="t mc0 x3e h11 y63b ff2 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">means to get acquainted with people, we held a health screening. </div><div class="t m5fd x3e h11 y959 ff2 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Many people came, and some signed up for the Bible courses. </div><div class="t m4c5 xf h11 y63d ff2 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Amy Chang was one who signed up. Amy, an elementary </div><div class="t m41a x3e h11 yb8b ff2 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">school teacher, studied the Bible course carefully. Soon she agreed </div><div class="t m6a4 x3e h11 y63e ff2 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to study the lessons with me. She fell in love with God and </div><div class="t m5d0 x3e h11 y63f ff2 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">accepted Jesus as her Saviour. She accepted the Bible truths we </div><div class="t m75 x3e h11 yb8c ff2 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">presented and joined our small group worshiping on Sabbath. </div><div class="t med xf h11 yb8d ff2 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">After studying several months, Amy decided to be baptized. </div><div class="t m202 x3e h11 y95c ff2 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">But she worried about the ancestors&apos; niche in her living room. </div><div class="t m313 x3e h11 y641 ff2 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Before she came to our church, she and her husband had wor-</div><div class="t m303 x3e h11 y642 ff2 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">shiped at the niche every day. Now her husband worshiped at the </div><div class="t m355 x3e h11 y95e ff2 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ancestors&apos; niche alone. Amy&apos;s husband loved her very much, but </div><div class="t m157 x3e h11 y644 ff2 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">he made it clear that her Christian friends were not welcome to </div><div class="t m29 x3e h11 y645 ff2 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">visit in their home. He refused to attend our programs, and would </div><div class="t m53 x3e h11 y646 ff2 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">not attend Amy&apos;s baptism. But we all joined Amy in praying for </div><div class="t m4a7 x3e h11 y95f ff2 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">her husband. </div><div class="t m51f x91 h11 y648 ff2 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Following her baptism, Amy went home from the church, and </div><div class="t m685 x3e h11 yb8e ff2 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">found that some sacred papers, which were kept in the wooden </div><div class="t m2d2 x2e h11 y649 ff2 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ancestors&apos; niche, had fallen to the ground.
