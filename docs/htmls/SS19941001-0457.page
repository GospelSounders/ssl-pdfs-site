Everything </div><div class="t m640 x22 h2c y671 ff3 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">looked so worn-out. My thoughts turned toward home. </div><div class="t m4fd x69 h2c y672 ff3 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">In my dorm room overlooking the green fields of Newbold </div><div class="t mc2 x22 h2c y673 ff3 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">College, my telephone rang. &quot;We need someone to go to </div><div class="t m641 x22 h2c y674 ff3 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Albania to pastor the new members.&quot; The minister&apos;s voice </div><div class="t m642 x22 h2c y675 ff3 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sounded urgent. &quot;Can you go for four months?&quot; </div><div class="t m643 x69 h2c yc4 ff3 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">How could I go?

They had suffered so much and had so little! </div><div class="t m647 x69 h2c y678 ff3 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Soon after I arrived I went to the town of Elbasan.

We sat around a small wooden table, </div><div class="t m296 x22 h2c y67c ff3 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Testaments open and eyes alert. I begain talking about Jesus. </div><div class="t m26a x69 h2c y67d ff3 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Who is Jesus?&quot; I asked. I received only quizzical looks. </div><div class="t m64d x22 h2c yd2 ff3 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">They didn&apos;t know! &quot;God,&quot; I prayed, &quot;speak through me.&quot; He </div><div class="t m64e xa6 h2c yd3 ff3 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">did. </div><div class="t m5dc x55 h2c y67e ff3 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">In that city filled with discouragement, seeds of hope began </div><div class="t m4e7 xa6 h2c y67f ff3 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to sprout.
