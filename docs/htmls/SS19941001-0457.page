Plaster hung off crumbling </div><div class="t m63f x22 h29 y66f ff3 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">buildings. People trudged slowly along the streets. Everything </div><div class="t m640 x22 h29 y670 ff3 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">looked so worn-out. My thoughts turned toward home. </div><div class="t m4fd x69 h29 y671 ff3 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">In my dorm room overlooking the green fields of Newbold </div><div class="t mc2 x22 h29 y672 ff3 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">College, my telephone rang. &quot;We need someone to go to </div><div class="t m641 x22 h29 y673 ff3 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Albania to pastor the new members.&quot; The minister&apos;s voice </div><div class="t m642 x22 h29 y674 ff3 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sounded urgent. &quot;Can you go for four months?&quot; </div><div class="t m643 x69 h29 yc3 ff3 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">How could I go? I was in the middle of my studies. But I </div><div class="t m58a x22 h29 y89 ff3 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">promised to pray about it. </div><div class="t m644 x69 h29 y675 ff3 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The college administrator assured me, &quot;We&apos;ll work it out.&quot; I </div><div class="t m645 x22 h29 y8f ff3 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">could leave my job.

They had suffered so much and had so little! </div><div class="t m647 x69 h29 y677 ff3 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Soon after I arrived I went to the town of Elbasan. As we </div><div class="t m648 x22 h29 yc8 ff3 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">neared the city we saw a huge industrial complex that nearly </div><div class="t m649 x22 h29 y678 ff3 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">filled the valley.

We sat around a small wooden table, </div><div class="t m296 x22 h29 y67b ff3 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Testaments open and eyes alert. I begain talking about Jesus. </div><div class="t m26a x69 h29 y67c ff3 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Who is Jesus?&quot; I asked. I received only quizzical looks. </div><div class="t m64d x22 h29 yd1 ff3 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">They didn&apos;t know! &quot;God,&quot; I prayed, &quot;speak through me.&quot; He </div><div class="t m64e xa6 h29 yd2 ff3 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">did. </div><div class="t m5dc x55 h29 y67d ff3 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">In that city filled with discouragement, seeds of hope began </div><div class="t m4e7 xa6 h29 y67e ff3 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to sprout.
