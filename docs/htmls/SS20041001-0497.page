When all the passengers were safely out of the bus, </div><div class="t m8f x9d ha ya4b ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Abanidas looked at the weeping, bleeding passengers.

He was the only one without a single scratch, cut, bruise, </div><div class="t m9a x9d ha ya4d ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">or broken bone. Abanidas whispered a prayer of thanks to the Lord, who </div><div class="t m172 x9d ha y46a ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">had saved him, the God he had just come to know and love a few months </div><div class="t m404 x9d ha y7e7 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">earlier. </div><div class="t m241 x15 ha ya4e ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Abanidas was a newspaper editor living in a village about one hundred </div><div class="t m423 x9d ha ya4f ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">kilometers (60 miles) north of Calcutta, India. For 32 years he had been a </div><div class="t m14 x9d ha ya50 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">teacher; then he settled down to the quieter life of an editor. However, the </div><div class="t m283 x9d ha ya51 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">change of job did not bring him the peace and satisfaction that he had </div><div class="t m272 x9d ha ya52 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">expected. </div><div class="t m5cc x15 ha ya53 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;I had many severe difficulties in my life,&quot; says Abanidas. &quot;I had fam-</div><div class="t m547 x19 ha ya54 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ily problems, village problems, political problems, and work problems. I </div><div class="t mda x19 ha ya55 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">could find no solution to my problems and was in deep distress of mind. I </div><div class="t mc7 x19 ha ya56 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">had hoped to find peace, but it eluded me. I felt adrift in an ocean of </div><div class="t m279 x19 ha y8a7 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">despair with no hope for the future.&quot; </div><div class="t m7b4 x3a ha ya57 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">It was at this time that Abanidas discovered a small group of people </div><div class="t mf x19 ha ya58 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">worshiping in a nearby house each Saturday morning.

He began to attend and to listen to the teachings of the </div><div class="t m20c x19 ha ya5b ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Bible. </div><div class="t mb6 x15 ha ya5c ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Finally, in God&apos;s Word I found the peace and solution to all of my prob-</div><div class="t m7b5 x19 ha ya5d ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">lems,&quot; Abanidas testifies. &quot;I found salvation and forgiveness in Jesus </div><div class="t m7b6 x19 ha ya5e ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Christ. I decided to keep the Sabbath, be baptized, and to prepare for </div><div class="t m59f x19 ha ya5f ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Christ&apos;s coming.&quot; He was baptized with some 2,000 other new believers in </div><div class="t m234 x19 ha ya60 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">a mass baptism in Calcutta in 1999. </div><div class="t m70c x3a ha ya61 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Shortly after his baptism, Abanidas felt called to serve God full time.
