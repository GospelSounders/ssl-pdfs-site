When all the passengers were safely out of the bus, </div><div class="t m8f x9c h8 ya4a ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Abanidas looked at the weeping, bleeding passengers.

He was the only one without a single scratch, cut, bruise, </div><div class="t m9a x9c h8 ya4c ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">or broken bone. Abanidas whispered a prayer of thanks to the Lord, who </div><div class="t m172 x9c h8 y469 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">had saved him, the God he had just come to know and love a few months </div><div class="t m404 x9c h8 y7e6 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">earlier. </div><div class="t m241 x14 h8 ya4d ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Abanidas was a newspaper editor living in a village about one hundred </div><div class="t m423 x9c h8 ya4e ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">kilometers (60 miles) north of Calcutta, India. For 32 years he had been a </div><div class="t m14 x9c h8 ya4f ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">teacher; then he settled down to the quieter life of an editor. However, the </div><div class="t m283 x9c h8 ya50 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">change of job did not bring him the peace and satisfaction that he had </div><div class="t m272 x9c h8 ya51 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">expected. </div><div class="t m5cc x14 h8 ya52 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;I had many severe difficulties in my life,&quot; says Abanidas. &quot;I had fam-</div><div class="t m547 x18 h8 ya53 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ily problems, village problems, political problems, and work problems. I </div><div class="t mda x18 h8 ya54 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">could find no solution to my problems and was in deep distress of mind. I </div><div class="t mc7 x18 h8 ya55 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">had hoped to find peace, but it eluded me. I felt adrift in an ocean of </div><div class="t m279 x18 h8 y8a6 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">despair with no hope for the future.&quot; </div><div class="t m7b4 x39 h8 ya56 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">It was at this time that Abanidas discovered a small group of people </div><div class="t mf x18 h8 ya57 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">worshiping in a nearby house each Saturday morning.

He began to attend and to listen to the teachings of the </div><div class="t m20c x18 h8 ya5a ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Bible. </div><div class="t mb6 x14 h8 ya5b ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Finally, in God&apos;s Word I found the peace and solution to all of my prob-</div><div class="t m7b5 x18 h8 ya5c ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">lems,&quot; Abanidas testifies. &quot;I found salvation and forgiveness in Jesus </div><div class="t m7b6 x18 h8 ya5d ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Christ.
