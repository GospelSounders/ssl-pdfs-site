During </div><div class="t m363 xb h20 y59f ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Communist times, she had no use for God or religion. She had held a </div><div class="t m4e5 xb h20 y5a0 ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">good position with a handsome income. She thought she was happy. </div><div class="t m290 xb h20 y5a1 ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Then Communism fell; her income ceased, and her life seemed to </div><div class="t m1c5 xb h20 y5a2 ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">crumble. Then her precious grandson became seriously ill, and the </div><div class="t m43a xb h20 y5a3 ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">doctors didn&apos;t think he would survive. Galena spent everything she </div><div class="t m33e xb h20 y5a4 ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">had trying to save his life, but still the boy remained dangerously ill. </div><div class="t m385 x18 h20 y5a5 ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">One night she had a dream. She saw a radiant-looking Person who </div><div class="t m266 xb h20 y372 ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">asked her, &quot;What do you want Me to do for you?&quot; </div><div class="t m19c x21 h20 y5a6 ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">She replied, &quot;Heal my grandson. I will give you four lambs in four </div><div class="t m4e6 xb h20 y5a7 ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">different holy places,&quot; she said, reflecting the Orthodox church&apos;s </div><div class="t m38e x1b h20 y5a8 ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tradition of giving sacrificial lambs as in the Old Testament. </div><div class="t mcb x18 h20 y5a9 ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;I don&apos;t want anything from you except love,&quot; the radiant Person </div><div class="t m2fa x1b h20 y5aa ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">replied. Galena glanced at her grandson sleeping in the corner and </div><div class="t m270 x1b h20 y376 ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">realized that he already had been healed. </div><div class="t m4e7 x21 h20 y5ab ff8 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">How should I worship God? </div><div class="t m4ab x61 h20 y5ab ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">she wondered. Then she saw herself </div><div class="t m66 x1b h20 y5ac ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sitting in a room in a house where someone was talking about the </div><div class="t mef x1b h20 y4b5 ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Bible. She awoke quite shaken by the dream but with no idea what it </div><div class="t m4e8 x1b h20 y5ad ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">meant. She tried to remember details of the dream, but she could not. </div><div class="t m496 x21 h20 y5ae ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">A short time later a friend invited Galena to attend church with her. </div><div class="t m279 x1b h20 y37c ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Galena was surprised to see that the Christians met in a room of an </div><div class="t m4e9 x1b h20 y5af ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ordinary house. She wondered if this was the house she had seen in her </div><div class="t m150 x1b h20 y37e ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">dream. She continued attending the church. </div><div class="t m4ea x21 h20 y5b0 ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">One Sunday the pastor introduced Pastor Namoradze, who would </div><div class="t m70 x1b h20 y380 ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">preach in the pastor&apos;s absence. Galena stared at the visitor in disbelief. </div><div class="t m4eb x1b h20 y5b1 ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">This was the man in her dream! </div><div class="t m6c x21 h20 y382 ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">When Galena learned that Pastor Namoradze was an Adventist </div><div class="t m484 x1b h20 y5b2 ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">minister with his own house church, she asked if she could worship </div><div class="t m3a8 x1b h20 y4ba ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">with his congregation. He warmly welcomed her. When she arrived, </div><div class="t m4ec x1b h20 yea ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">she recognized it as the one she had seen in her dream. Galena knew </div><div class="t m198 x1b h20 y385 ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">she was home! </div><div class="t m180 x1c h20 y5b3 ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Conditions in Georgia are difficult. Unemployment, crime, drugs, </div><div class="t m4d x1b h20 y5b4 ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and poverty are common. The average wage is $3 a month, but a loaf </div><div class="t m4ed x1b h20 y5b5 ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of bread costs 25 cents. Four of the seven young men in Pastor </div><div class="t mc4 x1b h20 y388 ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Namoradze&apos;s church are former drug addicts. &quot;Our life is not easy,&quot; </div><div class="t m359 x36 h20 y389 ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Pastor Namoradze said. &quot;We have no electricity, no gas, no heat, no </div><div class="t m9f x1b h20 y38a ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">water.
