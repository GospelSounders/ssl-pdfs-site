She </div><div class="t m1d7 x3f he y408 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">wanted to talk with Him, to receive His guidance, but her growing </div><div class="t m6b x3f he y409 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">awareness of her own sinfulness troubled her. How could she ever </div><div class="t m295 x3f he y219 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">be good enough to approach this mighty God? </div><div class="t m43e x57 he y40a ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">When the pastor visited her, she asked him to teach her how to </div><div class="t m25a x3f he y3a7 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">pray. Soon she made her first feeble attempts to communicate with </div><div class="t m49b x3f he y40b ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">her Creator. Other Christians shared their faith with her, prayed </div><div class="t m111 x3f he y40c ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">for her, and encouraged her in her steps of faith. </div><div class="t m4f x57 he y40d ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Drathai&apos;s parents had seen the letters that came to their daugh-</div><div class="t m49b x3f he y40e ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ter from the Bible correspondence school. They appreciated the </div><div class="t m49c x3f he y40f ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">positive influence of her Christian friends. But they did not </div><div class="t m49d x3f he y410 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">realize the depth of interest Drathai had in Christianity. </div><div class="t m22e x65 he y411 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Drathai decided to follow Jesus and be baptized. She knew that </div><div class="t m49e x3f he y412 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">her parents would try to stop her, so she was baptized secretly in </div><div class="t m49f x28 he y413 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the nearby river. When her parents learned of her baptism, her </div><div class="t m17e x28 he y55 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">mother cried bitterly. &quot;The spirits will punish us because you no </div><div class="t m4a0 x28 he y414 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">longer worship them!&quot; her mother cried. &quot;Please bow with me to </div><div class="t m422 x28 he y415 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the ancestors!&quot; Drathai quietly refused, explaining that a Christian </div><div class="t m43e x28 he y416 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">can have no other gods save the God of heaven. </div><div class="t m122 x65 he y417 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Friends also scolded her. &quot;You have been brainwashed! These </div><div class="t m4a1 x28 he y418 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Christians will bring the anger of our ancestors down upon us!&quot; </div><div class="t m139 x28 he y419 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Drathai struggled to retain her faith. In her distress she poured out </div><div class="t m4a2 x28 he y41a ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">her heart to Jesus. </div><div class="t m270 x65 he y22 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">God answered her prayers, and Drathai saw a remarkable change </div><div class="t m28 x28 he y41b ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in her parents&apos; attitude. They told her that she was almost an adult </div><div class="t m4a3 x28 he y41c ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and had a right to make important decisions about her life. </div><div class="t m229 x20 he y41d ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">When she finished secondary school, her pastor encouraged her </div><div class="t m46d x28 he y94 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to attend Spicer Memorial College in Pune, India. With her par-</div><div class="t m4a4 x55 he y41e ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ents&apos; permission, Drathai enrolled in the Christian college. </div><div class="t m41a x20 he y41f ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">She writes her parents often, thanking them for allowing her to </div><div class="t m278 x55 he y420 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">follow her faith and complete her education. &quot;I pray that the Holy </div><div class="t m27e x55 he y421 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Spirit will work in their hearts and lead them to know Jesus.
