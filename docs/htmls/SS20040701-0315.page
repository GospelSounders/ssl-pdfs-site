I pulled my scarf tighter around me as I </div><div class="t m1e1 x1 h6 y1cd ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">hurried from vespers to the bus stop. I shivered against the cold and tried </div><div class="t m1e2 x1 h6 y1ce ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to shield myself from the wind and blowing snow. I arrived at the bus stop </div><div class="t m1e3 x1 h6 y1cf ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to find just one other person standing there, a man in his forties. He </div><div class="t m1e4 x1 h6 y1d0 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">hunched down into his jacket and barely looked up to greet me. Then we </div><div class="t m1e5 x1 h6 y1d1 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">stood silently, waiting for the bus. </div><div class="t m1e6 x2c h6 y1d2 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I felt an almost overpowering urge to talk to this man. I asked the man </div><div class="t m1e7 x1 h6 y1d3 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">what time it was, just to make conversation. After a few moments of chit-</div><div class="t m1e8 x1 h6 y1d4 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">chat, this stranger told me that his name was Stefan and that he intended </div><div class="t m1e9 x1 h6 y1d5 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to commit suicide soon. I knew he was serious, for his entire body spoke </div><div class="t m1ea x1 h6 y1d6 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of hopelessness and unrelieved burdens. </div><div class="t m1eb x2c h6 y9b ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I asked him if he would tell me why he was so down on life. He told me </div><div class="t m1ec x0 h6 y1d7 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">he was an engineer and had been working in a factory in town. But recently </div><div class="t m12 x0 h6 y1d8 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">he had lost his job when the factory laid off many workers. Although he had </div><div class="t m104 x0 h6 y1d9 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">two university degrees, he could not find suitable work. To make matters </div><div class="t m1ed x1 h6 y1da ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">worse, his wife, who was a doctor, seemed to enjoy rubbing it in that he was </div><div class="t m1ee x0 h6 y1db ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">not working. Her attitude discouraged him more. He felt the sting of her </div><div class="t m1ef x0 h6 y1dc ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">reproach and knew that she did not appreciate him as a man or as a husband. </div><div class="t m100 x2e h6 y1dd ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">In the dim light of the street lamp, I could see that this man was visibly </div><div class="t m1f0 x0 h6 y1de ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">suffering as he shared his story. It was evident that he felt helpless to climb </div><div class="t m1f1 x0 h6 y1df ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">out of his depression. But how could I help him? Soon the bus would </div><div class="t m1f2 x0 h6 y1e0 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">come, and we would part. I prayed silently that God would give me wis-</div><div class="t mb1 x0 h6 y1e1 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">dom to say the right thing to this man. </div><div class="t m1f3 x2e h6 y1e2 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Within a few minutes the bus came, and we climbed aboard. It was </div><div class="t m160 x0 h6 y1e3 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">almost empty, and we found seats together in the back of the bus, where </div><div class="t m1f4 x0 h6 y1e4 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">we could talk without interruption. Stefan&apos;s eyes begged for a thread of </div><div class="t m1f5 x0 h6 y1e5 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">hope to hang on to. </div><div class="t mfd x2e h6 y1e6 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">My mind sifted through Bible stories to find one about a man who had </div><div class="t m1c6 x0 h6 y1e7 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">undergone great difficulties. The prophet Elijah came to mind, and I began </div><div class="t m1f6 x0 h6 y1e8 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">telling Stefan about Elijah. As I talked, I felt reassured that God had </div><div class="t m1f7 x3c h6 y1e9 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">planted this prophet&apos;s story in my mind. It was as if the words came to me </div><div class="t m1a5 x3c h6 y1ea ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">from nowhere, and I sensed that each word was doing its good work in this </div><div class="t m1f8 x3c h6 y83 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">man&apos;s consciousness. I had no doubt that the Holy Spirit guided our con-</div><div class="t m1f9 x3c h6 y1eb ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">versation. We spoke animatedly, and he had lots of questions. It was as if </div><div class="t m1fa x3c h6 y1ec ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">we were alone on the bus, totally unaware of the other passengers or of the </div><div class="t m1e7 x3c h6 y1ed ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">snow swirling outside. </div><div class="t m1fb x71 h6 y1ee ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">(continued next week) </div><div class="t m1fc x3c h36 y88 ff5 fs5 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">KRASIMIR KAREV </div><div class="t m1fd x23 h7 y88 ff5 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">is a pastor in Pernik, Bulgaria. </div><div class="t m24 x0 hf y1ef ff6 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Produced by the General Conference Sabbath School and Personal Ministries Dept. </div><div class="t m1fe x0 hf y1f0 ff6 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Email:gomission@gc.adventist.org </div><div class="t m2f x8 hf y1f0 ff6 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">î˜‰</div><div class="t m1cf x1f h6 y1f1 ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">13 </div></div><div class="pi" data-data='{"ctm":[1.000000,0.000000,0.000000,1.000000,0.000000,0.000000]}'></div></div>
