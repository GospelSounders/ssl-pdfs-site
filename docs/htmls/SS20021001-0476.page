It comes immediately after Jesus&apos; answer </div><div class="t m699 x80 h20 y5fc ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to the disciples about the signs of the end. Thus, Jesus </div><div class="t m39b x44 h20 y74c ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">is talking about the Second Coming—and our relationship to this </div><div class="t m303 x42 h20 y74d ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">dramatic and conclusive event. He had just finished explaining all </div><div class="t m69a x44 h20 y74b ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">about His return. But like most of us, the disciples needed some help </div><div class="t m69b x44 h20 y7f0 ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">understanding what He meant. </div><div class="t m466 x45 hd y74f ff6 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Read the parable (Matt. 25:1-13). Ignoring the details, focus, </div><div class="t m86 x44 hd y4ae ff6 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">instead, on its basic message. If you could describe its message </div><div class="t m5bb x7a hd y494 ff7 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in </div><div class="t m1f9 x44 hd y7f1 ff7 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">one word, </div><div class="t m69c xa hd y4af ff6 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">what would it be?

In the Bible that image is </div><div class="t m4ac x42 h20 y7f3 ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">often used to represent a faithful people, in contrast to harlot imagery, </div><div class="t m69f x44 h20 y5c3 ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">which symbolizes apostasy and rebellion (see Jer. 3:6; Rev. 17:5). </div><div class="t m6a0 x44 h20 y5c4 ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Thus, this parable is not about atheists or New Agers or pagans; </div><div class="t m44e x44 h20 y5c5 ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">instead, it is about followers of Jesus. </div><div class="t m4c5 x43 h20 y5c6 ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Notice, too, other similarities between the women: They all took </div><div class="t mf2 x44 h20 y5c7 ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">their lamps, they all went out to meet the bridegroom (so they all were </div><div class="t m26e x44 h20 y602 ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">expecting him), they all became drowsy, they all fell asleep, they all </div><div class="t m20f x44 h20 y617 ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">woke up at the announcement of his coming, and they all trimmed their </div><div class="t m413 x44 h20 y500 ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">lamps. From the outside, they all pretty much looked and acted alike. To </div><div class="t m6a1 x42 h20 y754 ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">anyone watching, there would not seem to be much difference between </div><div class="t m1e2 x42 h20 y5c9 ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">them. </div><div class="t m1fb x43 h20 y603 ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">They were all living in anticipation of the Advent hope.

These women, then, represent Christians who not only expect </div><div class="t m18f x42 h20 y7f4 ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Christ&apos;s return but make preparations to meet Him. None of them, not </div><div class="t m6a2 x42 h20 yd5 ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">even the foolish ones, represent those professed Christians who do not </div><div class="t m204 x42 h20 y5cf ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">believe in a literal return of Christ or those who believe His coming is </div><div class="t m118 x42 h20 y7f5 ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">so far off they do not make any preparations for it. </div><div class="t m1d3 x3c hd y5d2 ff6 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Look again at the basic characteristics that all these women </div><div class="t m4d8 x35 hd y4c8 ff6 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">share.
