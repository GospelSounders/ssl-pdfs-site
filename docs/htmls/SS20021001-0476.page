It comes immediately after Jesus&apos; answer </div><div class="t m699 x81 h24 y5fd ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to the disciples about the signs of the end. Thus, Jesus </div><div class="t m39b x45 h24 y74d ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">is talking about the Second Coming—and our relationship to this </div><div class="t m303 x43 h24 y74e ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">dramatic and conclusive event.
