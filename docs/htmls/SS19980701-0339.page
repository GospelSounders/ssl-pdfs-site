He was concerned about what his family&apos;s </div><div class="t mc8 xb hb y441 ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">response would be, so I agreed to pray with him that God would </div><div class="t m3e4 xb hb y2d8 ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">soften their hearts. </div><div class="t m1bf x22 hb y2d9 ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">He contacted them and told them that he had found the Seventh-</div><div class="t m143 xb hb y442 ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">day Adventist church in Sao Luis and had been studying the Bible </div><div class="t m3e5 xb hb y443 ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">with an Adventist. Then he told them of his decision to be baptized </div><div class="t m2a1 xb hb y444 ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">as a Seventh-day Adventist. His mother had heard that some reli-</div><div class="t m1c6 xb hb yec ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">gious sects were kidnapping and brainwashing young people. She </div><div class="t m3e6 xb hb y2dd ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">feared that Sidraque had fallen into the hands of one of these </div><div class="t m20f xb hb y445 ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">groups, and reacted strongly. &quot;If you join this church, forget that I </div><div class="t m222 xb hb y446 ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">am your mother!&quot; </div><div class="t m3e7 x22 hb y447 ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">However, Sidraque&apos;s father, who was quite ill at the time, told his </div><div class="t m58 xb hb y448 ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">son, &quot;If it is your desire, and if it is for your good, you may be </div><div class="t m185 x2b hb y449 ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">baptized.&quot; </div><div class="t m30 x22 hb y44a ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Sidraque wanted me to visit his father.

And if he </div><div class="t m2cc x2b hb y44c ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">should die before I am 18, my mother won&apos;t let me get baptized.&quot; </div><div class="t m3e9 x25 hb y44d ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">But Sidraque&apos;s family lived a long distance from Sao Luis, and I </div><div class="t m3ea x2b hb y44e ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">would not be able to go for several months. Because Sidraque wanted </div><div class="t m21a x2b hb y44f ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">his parents&apos; blessing on his baptism, he decided to wait. However, </div><div class="t m22e x2b hb y2e7 ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">just after Sidraque turned 18, his father died. A few weeks later </div><div class="t m3eb x2b hb y450 ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Sidraque and his three cousins, who had been studying with him, set </div><div class="t m296 x2b hb y2e9 ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the date for their baptism.
