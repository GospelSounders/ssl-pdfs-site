I quit school and stole money to </div><div class="t m0 x70 h5 y224 ff14 fs4 fc3 sc0 ls1f ws103">buy liquor. My family, my health, and my friends all suffered </div><div class="t m0 x70 h5 y225 ff14 fs4 fc3 sc0 ls1f ws6">because of me.</div><div class="t m0 x43 h5 y226 ff14 fs4 fc3 sc0 ls1f ws29">I began spitting up blood.

I was </div><div class="t m0 x70 h5 y228 ff14 fs4 fc3 sc0 ls1f ws7b">23 years old and married. Our lives were miserable because of </div><div class="t m0 x70 h5 y229 ff14 fs4 fc3 sc0 ls1f ws4a">my addiction. I drank up my earnings and left my family to find </div><div class="t m0 x70 h5 y22a ff14 fs4 fc3 sc0 ls1f ws102">food. </div><div class="t m0 x43 h5 y22b ff14 fs4 fc3 sc0 ls2 ws35">One night I staggered home drunk and saw a man waiting at a </div><div class="t m0 x70 h5 y22c ff14 fs4 fc3 sc0 ls2 ws26">bus stop. He turned to me and said he was a man of God. I stopped </div><div class="t m0 x70 h5 y22d ff14 fs4 fc3 sc0 ls2 ws102">to listen, and he told me, “There is a God who can solve your prob<span class="ws3">-</span></div><div class="t m0 x70 h5 y22e ff14 fs4 fc3 sc0 ls2 ws6">lems. I want to come to your house and tell you about Him.” </div><div class="t m0 x43 h5 y22f ff14 fs4 fc3 sc0 ls1f ws11e">“I’m not interested,” I told him. “I’m a drunkard, and I don’t </div><div class="t m0 x70 h5 y230 ff14 fs4 fc3 sc0 ls1f ws80">know God.” But the man walked with me to my home. There he </div><div class="t m0 x70 h5 y231 ff14 fs4 fc3 sc0 ls1f ws8b">told me about God.

I was sober and could understand what he was saying about </div><div class="t m0 x70 h5 y236 ff14 fs4 fc3 sc0 ls2 ws66">God. I was curious about this God who is alive and powerful and </div><div class="t m0 x70 h5 y237 ff14 fs4 fc3 sc0 ls2 wse2">who answers honest prayers. I wanted to know more, so I went with </div><div class="t m0 x70 h5 y238 ff14 fs4 fc3 sc0 ls2 ws6">the pastor to his house some 25 miles (40 km) to study with him. </div><div class="t m0 x43 h5 y239 ff14 fs4 fc3 sc0 ls2 ws99">God took away the desire for alcohol and cleared my mind.
