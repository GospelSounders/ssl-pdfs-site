Then in 1996 I learned that I had rectal cancer. </div><div class="t m39 x2f h11 y1dc ff3 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The doctors operated; then they began radiation treatments. But the treat-</div><div class="t m491 x2f h11 y1dd ff3 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ments did more harm than good, and I was in incredible pain. Doctors </div><div class="t mc4 x2f h11 y219 ff3 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">gave me morphine for the pain, but I became afraid to even eat. I lost </div><div class="t m331 x2f h11 y1df ff3 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">weight, and paralysis was slowly setting in.

Doctors operated to repair </div><div class="t m2cf x2f h11 y1cd ff3 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">my torn stitches, but they stopped midway through surgery, thinking I was </div><div class="t m12a x2f h11 y4d5 ff3 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">dead. </div><div class="t ma9 x86 h11 y21f ff3 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I awoke to see a beautiful city and a bright, shining being.
