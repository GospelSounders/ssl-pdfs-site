Then in 1996 I learned that I had rectal cancer. </div><div class="t m39 x2e hf y1db ff3 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The doctors operated; then they began radiation treatments. But the treat-</div><div class="t m491 x2e hf y1dc ff3 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ments did more harm than good, and I was in incredible pain. Doctors </div><div class="t mc4 x2e hf y218 ff3 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">gave me morphine for the pain, but I became afraid to even eat. I lost </div><div class="t m331 x2e hf y1de ff3 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">weight, and paralysis was slowly setting in. The doctors gave me little </div><div class="t m309 x2e hf y1df ff3 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">hope that I would survive. </div><div class="t m19a x6e hf y21a ff3 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">While I was still in the hospital, a fire in the hospital set off a severe </div><div class="t m33 x2e hf y1e1 ff3 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">asthma attack. I coughed so hard that I tore out my stitches and fell to the </div><div class="t m1de x2e hf y21b ff3 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">floor. When nurses rescued me, I could not breathe. </div><div class="t m389 x85 hf y21c ff3 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">X-rays showed that the fire had damaged my lungs, but worse, I also had </div><div class="t m5a7 x2e hf y1e4 ff3 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">lung cancer from heavy smoking over the years. Doctors operated to repair </div><div class="t m2cf x2e hf y1cc ff3 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">my torn stitches, but they stopped midway through surgery, thinking I was </div><div class="t m12a x2e hf y4d4 ff3 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">dead. </div><div class="t ma9 x85 hf y21e ff3 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I awoke to see a beautiful city and a bright, shining being. I felt peace-</div><div class="t m26e x2e hf y1e7 ff3 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ful and well, and I began to talk to the beautiful being. Doctors heard me </div><div class="t m214 x2e hf y1e8 ff3 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and stared in disbelief, thinking I had died. They quickly completed the </div><div class="t m1a2 x2e hf y1e9 ff3 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">surgery and took me to recovery. </div><div class="t m5b4 x85 hf y1ea ff3 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Just hours after surgery I felt better than I had felt in months—years, </div><div class="t m579 x8f hf y1eb ff3 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">even.

It was as if superhuman strength poured through my </div><div class="t mae x8f hf yfd ff3 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">body. A hospital worker asked my son, a doctor, if I was a believer, and he </div><div class="t m17b x8f hf y47c ff3 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">told the man that my only loves in life were women, tobacco, and alcohol. </div><div class="t mef x8f hf y1ed ff3 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Then the worker told my son I had been quoting Scripture to them, though </div><div class="t m166 x8f hf y67c ff3 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I had never read the Bible.
