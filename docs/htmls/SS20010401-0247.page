One morning he awoke to the sounds of angry </div><div class="t m61 x5f h11 y5a2 ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">shouting and stones bouncing off the metal doors of his furniture </div><div class="t m4ca x5f h11 y5a3 ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">shop that adjoined his home. From his window he could see flames </div><div class="t m155 x5f h11 y21b ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">devour a business across the street. </div><div class="t m4b3 x26 h11 y5a4 ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The police were powerless to stop the rampaging mobs. The </div><div class="t m4cb x5f h11 y408 ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">family gathered to ask for God&apos;s protection. </div><div class="t m34c x26 h11 y21e ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The hail of stones increased. Then the doctor heard someone </div><div class="t m114 x5f h11 y21f ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">trying to break through the heavy iron doors that protected the </div><div class="t m66 x5f h11 y40a ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">building.

He had treated many of </div><div class="t m209 x5f h11 y5a6 ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">their medical needs, often for free if they could not pay. </div><div class="t m1dd x26 h11 y40e ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Now these neighbors stood between the rioters and the doctor&apos;s </div><div class="t m4ce x5f h11 y5a7 ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">family, shouting, &quot;Please leave!
