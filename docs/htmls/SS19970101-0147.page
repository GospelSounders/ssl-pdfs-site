Her friend had invited her and </div><div class="t m3bb x78 h1a y69a ff4 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">told her about the fun she would have singing songs, learning Bible </div><div class="t m303 x78 h1a y69b ff4 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">verses, and making crafts. Although her parents were not religious, </div><div class="t m37b x78 h1a y69c ff4 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">they thought it would be good for her to have something special to </div><div class="t m137 xd h1d y69d ff3 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">do </div><div class="t m134 x78 h1a y69e ff4 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">during vacation, so they gave her permission to attend the program. </div><div class="t m255 xc h1a y3a ff4 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Margarita loved Vacation Bible School, and the teachers loved </div><div class="t m1e x5 h1a y69f ff4 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">her. Eagerly she learned the songs and memorized the Bible verses. </div><div class="t m202 x5 h1a y6a0 ff4 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">And she especially enjoyed making the crafts.
