Already two babies had died, </div><div class="t m174 x2a h19 y27f ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and many more children were sick. These people are not vaccinated </div><div class="t m555 x2a h19 y42b ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">against childhood diseases, because their villages are too isolated, too </div><div class="t m21f x2a h19 y281 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">dangerous and too difficult to hike to. The nearest hospital was a day&apos;s </div><div class="t m556 x2a h19 y282 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">hike down the mountain, and my student-missionary partner and I had </div><div class="t m557 x2a h19 y346 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">no medicines to help the sick ones. </div><div class="t m558 x4a h19 y42e ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">We went from one hut to another, praying and offering what help </div><div class="t m181 x13 h19 y348 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">we could. In one hut we found a baby lying on a mat, gasping for </div><div class="t m1e7 x13 h19 y285 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">breath. The family had gathered to watch, weep, and wait for death. </div><div class="t m559 x4a h19 y431 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">We had no medicines, but we offered to pray. We wet a small towel </div><div class="t m55a x13 h19 y34b ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and bathed the baby, then we asked God to heal the child. The father </div><div class="t m141 x13 h19 y537 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">stared silently at us, his face crowded with worry and puzzlement. </div><div class="t m55b x2a h19 y287 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;How can a wet towel heal our baby?&quot; he asked, agitated. </div><div class="t m237 x4a h19 y188 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">We explained that it could help bring down the baby&apos;s fever. We </div><div class="t m55c x13 h19 y289 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">prepared to leave, sure that God would answer our prayer. We shook </div><div class="t m1f8 x13 h19 y649 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">hands with the family members, but the father refused and stared at us </div><div class="t m55d x13 h19 y28a ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">coldly. </div><div class="t m55e x4a h19 y28b ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;What is wrong, sir?&quot; I asked. But he said nothing. We felt sure that </div><div class="t m55f x13 h19 y539 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">if the child died, the father would blame us. </div><div class="t m1e7 x6c h19 y28e ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">We had barely reached our cottage when somebody ran toward us. </div><div class="t m494 x13 h19 y482 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Sir! Sir! The father is very angry. He knows that the wet towel is not </div><div class="t m560 x13 h19 yd7 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">medicine, and he has threatened to kill you both!&quot; </div><div class="t m14a x6c h19 y64a ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">We entered our cottage and knelt to pray once more. &quot;Lord, our </div><div class="t mca x13 h19 y28f ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Great Physician, there is nothing else we can do to save the baby. </div><div class="t m1ef x13 h19 y290 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Please spare her life as well as ours. Amen.&quot; We claimed promises of </div><div class="t m52c x13 h19 y64b ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">God&apos;s protection, then we prepared for bed. </div><div class="t m4f5 x6c h19 y28 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Through the spaces between the boards of our hut, we saw some-</div><div class="t m3f5 x13 h19 y292 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">thing move. Figures silhouetted in the moonlight walked toward our </div><div class="t m561 x13 h19 y64c ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">hut. It was the family of the sick baby. They walked past our cottage </div><div class="t m562 x13 h19 y48a ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">toward a relative&apos;s hut, but the father kept staring at our cottage. All </div><div class="t m563 x13 h19 y64d ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was quiet again, and we fell asleep. </div><div class="t m52c x6c h19 y4da ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The next morning someone knocked at our door.

This time his face wore a smile, and in his hand he carried some </div><div class="t m565 x13 h19 y567 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sweet potatoes. &quot;Thank you, teacher,&quot; he said. &quot;My baby is well now!&quot; </div><div class="t m4d6 x21 h19 y568 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">We pray that the father and others in this village will learn to love </div><div class="t m566 x70 h19 y64e ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and trust the Great Healer whom we worship. </div><div class="t m567 x21 h31 y491 ff4 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Peter Sinagpulo is a student at Mountain View College in Mindanao, </div><div class="t m15c x70 h31 ye5 ff4 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">southern Philippines. </div><div class="t m55f x83 h32 y64f ff2 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Produced by the Office of Mission </div><div class="t m205 x5c h32 y650 ff2 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Sabbath School-Personal Ministries department of the General Conference </div><div class="t m568 xc h32 y651 ff2 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Email: gomission@gc.adventistorg </div><div class="t m3f x89 h32 y652 ff2 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">î˜‰</div><div class="t m569 x74 h19 y4de ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">63 </div></div><div class="pi" data-data='{"ctm":[1.000000,0.000000,0.000000,1.000000,0.000000,0.000000]}'></div></div>
