Just hours after my final surgery, I was out of bed visiting other </div><div class="t mab x22 h11 y6f4 ff3 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">patients. Soon doctors could find no reason to keep me longer. </div><div class="t m44 x6f h11 y6f5 ff3 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">When Christians had come to visit me in the hospital, I had made fun of </div><div class="t m5fd x22 h11 y6f6 ff3 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">them. But when my Christian niece came to see me, I was thrilled. She </div><div class="t maf x22 h11 y6f7 ff3 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">brought me a Bible, and I begged her to stay to help me understand it. I </div><div class="t m1a1 x22 h11 y1c9 ff3 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">wanted so much to find out what God had to say about what had happened </div><div class="t m462 x22 h11 y6f8 ff3 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to me. </div><div class="t m245 x6f h11 y6f9 ff3 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">My niece stayed for three days to help me begin my journey to God. We </div><div class="t m289 x22 h11 y6fa ff3 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">spent hours talking about God and His Word. I asked her how to become </div><div class="t m24f x2f h11 y6fb ff3 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">a Christian, and she prayed with me while I accepted Jesus as my Savior. </div><div class="t m262 x2f h11 y6fc ff3 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Then I asked forgiveness of all the Christians whom I had ridiculed while </div><div class="t mba x2f h11 y6fd ff3 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in the hospital. </div><div class="t m62 x6f h11 y6fe ff3 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I made a promise to God that I would tell others what He had done for </div><div class="t m4e6 x2f h11 y6ed ff3 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">me wherever I had a chance. So I began walking to churches throughout </div><div class="t m445 x2f h11 y6ff ff3 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">central Cuba giving my testimony to all who would listen. But I still did </div><div class="t m257 x2f h11 y700 ff3 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">not have a church home of my own.

After the service I asked the pastor how I </div><div class="t md8 x2f h11 y707 ff3 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">could make this church my home.
