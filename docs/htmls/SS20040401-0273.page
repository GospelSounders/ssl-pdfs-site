Just hours after my final surgery, I was out of bed visiting other </div><div class="t mab x21 hf y6f3 ff3 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">patients. Soon doctors could find no reason to keep me longer. </div><div class="t m44 x6e hf y6f4 ff3 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">When Christians had come to visit me in the hospital, I had made fun of </div><div class="t m5fd x21 hf y6f5 ff3 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">them. But when my Christian niece came to see me, I was thrilled. She </div><div class="t maf x21 hf y6f6 ff3 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">brought me a Bible, and I begged her to stay to help me understand it. I </div><div class="t m1a1 x21 hf y1c8 ff3 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">wanted so much to find out what God had to say about what had happened </div><div class="t m462 x21 hf y6f7 ff3 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to me. </div><div class="t m245 x6e hf y6f8 ff3 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">My niece stayed for three days to help me begin my journey to God. We </div><div class="t m289 x21 hf y6f9 ff3 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">spent hours talking about God and His Word. I asked her how to become </div><div class="t m24f x2e hf y6fa ff3 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">a Christian, and she prayed with me while I accepted Jesus as my Savior. </div><div class="t m262 x2e hf y6fb ff3 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Then I asked forgiveness of all the Christians whom I had ridiculed while </div><div class="t mba x2e hf y6fc ff3 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in the hospital. </div><div class="t m62 x6e hf y6fd ff3 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I made a promise to God that I would tell others what He had done for </div><div class="t m4e6 x2e hf y6ec ff3 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">me wherever I had a chance. So I began walking to churches throughout </div><div class="t m445 x2e hf y6fe ff3 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">central Cuba giving my testimony to all who would listen. But I still did </div><div class="t m257 x2e hf y6ff ff3 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">not have a church home of my own. Always there seemed to be something </div><div class="t m18b x2e hf y700 ff3 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">about the churches I visited that did not seem quite right. </div><div class="t m58d x85 hf y701 ff3 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Then an Adventist man invited me to come to his church to give my tes-</div><div class="t m27a x2e hf y702 ff3 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">timony.

As I lis-</div><div class="t m3a x2e hf y704 ff3 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tened to the sermon I sensed that I had found the true church, the one that </div><div class="t m175 x2e hf y705 ff3 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">followed all of God&apos;s teachings. After the service I asked the pastor how I </div><div class="t md8 x2e hf y706 ff3 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">could make this church my home.
