One </div><div class="t m6a1 x16 hc y62d ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of Rojas&apos;s close friends and police officers was a faithful Seventh-day </div><div class="t m6e1 x16 hc y4f4 ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Adventist. When the Adventist officer died in an accident, his widow </div><div class="t m21 x16 hc y62e ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">told Rojas, &quot;If my husband were alive today, he would want you to </div><div class="t m6e2 x16 hc y4f6 ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">take his place as the only Adventist police officer in this city.&quot; </div><div class="t m6e3 x17 hc y50d ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;I will do it,&quot; Rojas promised. And he did. </div><div class="t m5ed x17 hc y4f8 ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Rojas&apos;s new beliefs brought changes to his command.

The commander of the police at the time was dealing with </div><div class="t m6e4 x16 hc y4fc ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">serious ethical problems in the police force. He noticed the differences </div><div class="t me4 x4f hc y54c ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in Rojas&apos; unit and asked his secret for raising the standard among </div><div class="t m1f0 x16 hc y4fd ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">those under his command. </div><div class="t m6e5 x17 hc y62f ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Rojas answered, &quot;Love for Jesus is changing my officers.
