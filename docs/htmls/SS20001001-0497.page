One </div><div class="t m6a1 x16 ha y62c ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of Rojas&apos;s close friends and police officers was a faithful Seventh-day </div><div class="t m6e1 x16 ha y4f3 ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Adventist. When the Adventist officer died in an accident, his widow </div><div class="t m21 x16 ha y62d ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">told Rojas, &quot;If my husband were alive today, he would want you to </div><div class="t m6e2 x16 ha y4f5 ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">take his place as the only Adventist police officer in this city.&quot; </div><div class="t m6e3 x17 ha y50c ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;I will do it,&quot; Rojas promised. And he did. </div><div class="t m5ed x17 ha y4f7 ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Rojas&apos;s new beliefs brought changes to his command. His troops </div><div class="t m74 x16 ha y4f8 ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">became known for their honesty, refusal to take bribes, and high </div><div class="t m580 x16 ha y4fa ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">morale. The commander of the police at the time was dealing with </div><div class="t m6e4 x16 ha y4fb ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">serious ethical problems in the police force. He noticed the differences </div><div class="t me4 x4f ha y54b ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in Rojas&apos; unit and asked his secret for raising the standard among </div><div class="t m1f0 x16 ha y4fc ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">those under his command. </div><div class="t m6e5 x17 ha y62e ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Rojas answered, &quot;Love for Jesus is changing my officers.

After several </div><div class="t m1e6 x4f ha y869 ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">staff members prayed, the group sang another lively song. After they </div><div class="t m6e0 x4f ha y36d ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">returned to their duties General Rojas said, &quot;We begin each day with </div><div class="t m4a6 x4f ha y236 ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">God.&quot; </div><div class="t m330 x46 ha y7e1 ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Rojas introduced us to Samuel Cueva, a recent graduate of Andrews </div><div class="t m348 x4f ha y238 ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">University whose job is to share the ethical principles of the Bible </div><div class="t m6e8 x4f ha y7e2 ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">with the police force of Peru.
