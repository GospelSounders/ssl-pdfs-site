He gives his background </div><div class="t m7c x16 h16 y6e ff3 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in just 13 words. He tells us that his father is Pethuel but gives no </div><div class="t m7d x16 h16 y6f ff3 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">clue as to what tribe he comes from. Neither does he list the kings </div><div class="t m7e x16 h16 y70 ff3 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">under whom he prophesied. Because he ministered in Judah and </div><div class="t m7f x16 h16 y71 ff3 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Jerusalem, it seems likely that he was a native of Judah. His name </div><div class="t m80 x16 h16 y72 ff3 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">means &quot;Yahweh is God.&quot; </div><div class="t m81 x2e h16 y73 ff3 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The time in which Joel wrote is debated by scholars. They have </div><div class="t m82 x16 h16 y74 ff3 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">suggested dates ranging from the ninth century B.C. to the mid-fifth </div><div class="t m83 x16 h16 y75 ff3 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">century B.C. John Calvin insightfully remarked that knowledge of </div><div class="t m84 x16 h16 y76 ff3 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the exact time in which Joel wrote &quot;is of no great importance.&quot; Joel&apos;s </div><div class="t m85 x19 h16 y77 ff3 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">message has timeless significance. If he wrote before the exile, the </div><div class="t m86 x16 h16 y78 ff3 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;day of the Lord&quot; could refer to the Babylonian invasions. If he wrote </div><div class="t m87 x16 h16 y79 ff3 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">after the exile, the &quot;day of the Lord&quot; could refer to the Greek or </div><div class="t m88 x19 h16 y7a ff3 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Roman attacks on Palestine. Whatever the historical context of his </div><div class="t m89 x16 h16 y7b ff3 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">book, its end-time significance remains intact. </div><div class="t m8a x2e h16 y7c ff3 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Ellen G.
