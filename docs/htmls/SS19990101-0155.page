But I find ways to spread </div><div class="t m532 x9 h24 y13d ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the news of God&apos;s love to people who have never heard it before. </div><div class="t m2f2 x29 h24 y13e ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Many people in China are eager to know about God. </div><div class="t mba x25 h24 y44e ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">One of my teachers, Mr. Lu, began asking me questions about </div><div class="t m533 x29 h24 y27f ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the Bible. I answered with caution, because I did not know if he </div><div class="t m4d7 x29 h24 y13f ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was a secret spy. But he was sincere, and soon we began studying </div><div class="t m534 x29 h24 y1f6 ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the Bible behind tightly closed doors. Mr. Lu and his wife ac-</div><div class="t m3ab x29 h24 y293 ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">cepted Jesus as their Lord. Now he is eager to tell others about the </div><div class="t mc8 x29 h24 yfd ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">freedom found in Christ. Often he comes to ask for Bibles to give </div><div class="t m4d7 x29 h24 y294 ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to someone he has told about Christ. </div><div class="t m186 x1d h24 y127 ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">But he must be careful. A few years ago Mr. Lu was accused of </div><div class="t mfd x29 h24 y6e ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">criticizing the government. He was questioned by the university, </div><div class="t m372 x29 h24 y128 ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and his salary was reduced. He knows he is being watched. </div><div class="t m438 x1d h24 y295 ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Mr. Lu&apos;s brother and his family, who live in another province, </div><div class="t m535 x29 h24 y1f7 ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">became Christians three years ago, but they cannot fellowship with </div><div class="t m72 x29 h24 y129 ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">other Christians in the area. It is too dangerous. They have never </div><div class="t m536 x29 h24 y297 ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">seen a Bible! The government is very strict there, and the family&apos;s </div><div class="t m41e x29 h24 y1f8 ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">home has been searched twice for religious materials. Parcels </div><div class="t m43b x29 h24 ydd ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">arriving from outside the area are searched, and even passengers </div><div class="t m42d x29 h24 y298 ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">arriving from other areas are spot-searched for religious materials. </div><div class="t m308 x29 h24 y287 ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">In spite of this danger, Mr. Lu plans to carry Bibles and literature </div><div class="t m233 x29 h24 y1e1 ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to his brother&apos;s family when he visits. Because he was born there, </div><div class="t m3d3 x29 h24 y288 ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">he hopes that authorities will not search him. Pray for him! </div><div class="t m3aa x1d h24 y1fb ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I tutor 13 students on a private basis and study the Bible with </div><div class="t m37b x29 h24 ye1 ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">several others. Two students from inner Mongolia recently gave </div><div class="t m537 x7d h24 y28a ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">their hearts to the Lord. It is precious to see these intelligent, </div><div class="t m141 x7d h24 y28b ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">earnest young people choose to follow God so wholeheartedly! </div><div class="t m538 x56 h24 y299 ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Recently I spent my school holiday visiting former students. I </div><div class="t m237 x7d h24 y1e7 ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">stayed in the home of Chin Le. Her family are new Christians, and </div><div class="t m4f0 x7d h24 y1e8 ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">already they have won a number of others to God. These new believ-</div><div class="t m47c x7d h24 y1e9 ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ers came to Chin Le&apos;s home to study the Bible and find answers to </div><div class="t m22f x7d h24 y29b ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">their questions. If it were discovered that a foreigner was teaching </div><div class="t m539 x7d h24 y1eb ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">them, the believers would face great hardships. So I hid in the house </div><div class="t m4e7 x7d h24 y34a ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and did not even peek out the door for a whole week! </div><div class="t m3a7 x56 h24 ya6 ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">These people have so much love for the Lord! Many were mem-</div><div class="t m53a x3e h24 y29f ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">bers of a Sunday church whom Chin Le told about the Sabbath. Since </div><div class="t m53b x3e h24 y34b ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the group was formed four years ago, they have established at least </div><div class="t m37a x3e h24 y1ef ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sixteen other congregations with more than two thousand worship-</div><div class="t m303 x3e h24 y2a1 ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ersâ€”all without a pastor. Pray for our believers in China! </div><div class="t m53c x56 h2a y2d4 ff3 fs1e fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The author, whose name must remain a secret, lives and ministers in </div><div class="t m2fc x3e h2a y3ed ff3 fs1e fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">a large city in China. </div><div class="t m202 x64 h24 y3cc ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Produced by the General Conference Office of Mission Awareness </div><div class="t m202 x5 h24 y44f ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">E-mail: gomission@compuserve.com </div><div class="t m204 x3d h24 y44f ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0"> </div><div class="t m1b2 x4a h24 y34d ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">53 </div></div><div class="pi" data-data='{"ctm":[1.000000,0.000000,0.000000,1.000000,0.000000,0.000000]}'></div></div>
