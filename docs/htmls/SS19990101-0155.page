But I find ways to spread </div><div class="t m532 xa h26 y13e ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the news of God&apos;s love to people who have never heard it before. </div><div class="t m2f2 x2a h26 y13f ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Many people in China are eager to know about God. </div><div class="t mba x26 h26 y44f ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">One of my teachers, Mr. Lu, began asking me questions about </div><div class="t m533 x2a h26 y280 ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the Bible. I answered with caution, because I did not know if he </div><div class="t m4d7 x2a h26 y140 ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was a secret spy. But he was sincere, and soon we began studying </div><div class="t m534 x2a h26 y1f7 ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the Bible behind tightly closed doors. Mr. Lu and his wife ac-</div><div class="t m3ab x2a h26 y294 ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">cepted Jesus as their Lord. Now he is eager to tell others about the </div><div class="t mc8 x2a h26 yfe ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">freedom found in Christ. Often he comes to ask for Bibles to give </div><div class="t m4d7 x2a h26 y295 ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to someone he has told about Christ. </div><div class="t m186 x1e h26 y128 ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">But he must be careful. A few years ago Mr. Lu was accused of </div><div class="t mfd x2a h26 y6f ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">criticizing the government. He was questioned by the university, </div><div class="t m372 x2a h26 y129 ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and his salary was reduced. He knows he is being watched. </div><div class="t m438 x1e h26 y296 ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Mr. Lu&apos;s brother and his family, who live in another province, </div><div class="t m535 x2a h26 y1f8 ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">became Christians three years ago, but they cannot fellowship with </div><div class="t m72 x2a h26 y12a ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">other Christians in the area. It is too dangerous. They have never </div><div class="t m536 x2a h26 y298 ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">seen a Bible! The government is very strict there, and the family&apos;s </div><div class="t m41e x2a h26 y1f9 ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">home has been searched twice for religious materials. Parcels </div><div class="t m43b x2a h26 yde ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">arriving from outside the area are searched, and even passengers </div><div class="t m42d x2a h26 y299 ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">arriving from other areas are spot-searched for religious materials. </div><div class="t m308 x2a h26 y288 ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">In spite of this danger, Mr. Lu plans to carry Bibles and literature </div><div class="t m233 x2a h26 y1e2 ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to his brother&apos;s family when he visits. Because he was born there, </div><div class="t m3d3 x2a h26 y289 ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">he hopes that authorities will not search him. Pray for him! </div><div class="t m3aa x1e h26 y1fc ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I tutor 13 students on a private basis and study the Bible with </div><div class="t m37b x2a h26 ye2 ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">several others. Two students from inner Mongolia recently gave </div><div class="t m537 x7e h26 y28b ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">their hearts to the Lord. It is precious to see these intelligent, </div><div class="t m141 x7e h26 y28c ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">earnest young people choose to follow God so wholeheartedly! </div><div class="t m538 x57 h26 y29a ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Recently I spent my school holiday visiting former students. I </div><div class="t m237 x7e h26 y1e8 ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">stayed in the home of Chin Le. Her family are new Christians, and </div><div class="t m4f0 x7e h26 y1e9 ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">already they have won a number of others to God. These new believ-</div><div class="t m47c x7e h26 y1ea ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ers came to Chin Le&apos;s home to study the Bible and find answers to </div><div class="t m22f x7e h26 y29c ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">their questions. If it were discovered that a foreigner was teaching </div><div class="t m539 x7e h26 y1ec ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">them, the believers would face great hardships. So I hid in the house </div><div class="t m4e7 x7e h26 y34b ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and did not even peek out the door for a whole week! </div><div class="t m3a7 x57 h26 ya7 ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">These people have so much love for the Lord! Many were mem-</div><div class="t m53a x3f h26 y2a0 ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">bers of a Sunday church whom Chin Le told about the Sabbath. Since </div><div class="t m53b x3f h26 y34c ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the group was formed four years ago, they have established at least </div><div class="t m37a x3f h26 y1f0 ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sixteen other congregations with more than two thousand worship-</div><div class="t m303 x3f h26 y2a2 ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ersâ€”all without a pastor.
