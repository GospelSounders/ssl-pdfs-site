Ruth 4:15. </div><div class="t m20b x7d h19 y433 ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Notice the praise given Ruth. Sons were highly honored in ancient soci-</div><div class="t m484 x2c h19 y69b ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">eties, while daughters were often less regarded. In Gentile cultures, girl </div><div class="t m9a x6 h19 y69c ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">babies many times were cast aside to die. Even Jewish parents might be </div><div class="t m376 x2c h19 y69d ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">disappointed at the birth of a female infant. One ancient Jewish writer men-</div><div class="t m392 x6 h19 y437 ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tioned the sorrow some felt at the arrival of a girl child. But in this verse, </div><div class="t m303 x6 h19 y69e ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Ruth is considered to be of more value than seven sons. </div><div class="t m485 x2c hf y69f ff1 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">COMPARE the women&apos;s statement that Ruth was of more value than </div><div class="t m448 x2c hf y6a0 ff1 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">seven sons with what Elkanah said in his rather clumsy attempt to com-</div><div class="t m135 x2c hf y6a1 ff1 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">fort Hannah recorded in 1 Samuel 1:8. </div><div class="t m1d7 x3b h19 y6a2 ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The women recognized the worth of a life of loving action. Ruth came </div><div class="t m139 x2c h19 y54e ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">from a people that had long been enemies of the Hebrews, but she reflected </div><div class="t m2a1 x2c h19 y6a3 ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the love of the God she had chosen to follow.

But, unlike the book of Job, the book of Ruth does </div><div class="t m20b x2c h19 y6ac ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">not reveal insights into why God allowed tragedy to come to Naomi. Both </div><div class="t m235 x2c h19 y6ad ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Job and Naomi had to learn to live without knowing why such tragic events </div><div class="t m21a x2c h19 y6ae ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">had been allowed to enter their God-fearing lives. </div><div class="t m474 x2c hf y6af ff1 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ILLUMINATION: </div><div class="t m294 x3c h19 y6b0 ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Naomi, like Job . . . is rendered bereft of those things </div><div class="t m3c8 x2c h19 y6b1 ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">which provide her security and she cannot comprehend why. . . . These two </div><div class="t m175 x2c h19 y6b2 ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">characters in Old Testament stories are parallel, and the audience is meant to </div><div class="t m13a x2c h19 y6b3 ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ask the question &apos;Why?&apos; with them.
