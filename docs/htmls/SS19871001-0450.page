Ruth 4:15. </div><div class="t m20b x7c h17 y432 ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Notice the praise given Ruth. Sons were highly honored in ancient soci-</div><div class="t m484 x2b h17 y69a ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">eties, while daughters were often less regarded. In Gentile cultures, girl </div><div class="t m9a x5 h17 y69b ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">babies many times were cast aside to die. Even Jewish parents might be </div><div class="t m376 x2b h17 y69c ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">disappointed at the birth of a female infant. One ancient Jewish writer men-</div><div class="t m392 x5 h17 y436 ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tioned the sorrow some felt at the arrival of a girl child. But in this verse, </div><div class="t m303 x5 h17 y69d ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Ruth is considered to be of more value than seven sons. </div><div class="t m485 x2b hd y69e ff1 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">COMPARE the women&apos;s statement that Ruth was of more value than </div><div class="t m448 x2b hd y69f ff1 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">seven sons with what Elkanah said in his rather clumsy attempt to com-</div><div class="t m135 x2b hd y6a0 ff1 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">fort Hannah recorded in 1 Samuel 1:8. </div><div class="t m1d7 x3a h17 y6a1 ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The women recognized the worth of a life of loving action. Ruth came </div><div class="t m139 x2b h17 y54d ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">from a people that had long been enemies of the Hebrews, but she reflected </div><div class="t m2a1 x2b h17 y6a2 ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the love of the God she had chosen to follow. For this the women of Bethle-</div><div class="t m1cd x2b h17 y6a3 ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">hem honored her. </div><div class="t m219 x3a hd y6a4 ff1 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">What must Naomi have learned about God from this experience? </div><div class="t m486 x3a h17 y6a5 ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Naomi earlier (Ruth 1:13, 20, 21) had lodged a complaint against God. </div><div class="t m351 x2b h17 y1a ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">As Edward Campbell, Jr., reminds us, &quot;Complaint in the Bible regularly </div><div class="t m487 x2b h17 y6a6 ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">amounts to bringing a formal case against God.

The </div><div class="t m353 x2b h17 y6a8 ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">people of the Bible were not afraid to question God&apos;s actions.

But, unlike the book of Job, the book of Ruth does </div><div class="t m20b x2b h17 y6ab ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">not reveal insights into why God allowed tragedy to come to Naomi. Both </div><div class="t m235 x2b h17 y6ac ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Job and Naomi had to learn to live without knowing why such tragic events </div><div class="t m21a x2b h17 y6ad ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">had been allowed to enter their God-fearing lives. </div><div class="t m474 x2b hd y6ae ff1 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ILLUMINATION: </div><div class="t m294 x3b h17 y6af ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Naomi, like Job . . . is rendered bereft of those things </div><div class="t m3c8 x2b h17 y6b0 ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">which provide her security and she cannot comprehend why. . . . These two </div><div class="t m175 x2b h17 y6b1 ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">characters in Old Testament stories are parallel, and the audience is meant to </div><div class="t m13a x2b h17 y6b2 ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ask the question &apos;Why?&apos; with them. As in Job, there will be resolutions of </div><div class="t m48a x2b h17 y6b3 ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the calamities, but not a final answer to the question &apos;Why?&apos; &quot;—Edward </div><div class="t m153 x2b h17 y6b4 ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Campbell, </div><div class="t m45d x91 h17 y6b4 ff5 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Ruth, </div><div class="t m2d6 x83 h17 y6b4 ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">p. 167. </div><div class="t m48b x3a h17 y6b5 ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">In time we shall see that God has had good reasons for postponing the </div><div class="t m48c x2b h17 y6b6 ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">answer to our questions.
