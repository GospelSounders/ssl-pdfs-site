GOD AND TIME (2 Peter 3:8). </div><div class="t m98 x5f h19 y7a1 ff1 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The pastor-spirit in Peter was deeply concerned over the impact that </div><div class="t m327 x3c h19 y7a2 ff1 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">unscriptural and unspiritual teaching was having on the congregations to </div><div class="t m621 xb h19 y7a3 ff1 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">whom he was writing.

It prompts him at this point in his epistle to defend </div><div class="t m250 x3c h19 y4a1 ff1 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the Lord&apos;s dealings with humanity, both in the past and in the days to </div><div class="t m304 xb h19 y33a ff1 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">come.

This is Peter&apos;s re-</div><div class="t m6cf xb h19 y7f5 ff1 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sponse to the heretical suggestions that are worrying his flock. He applies </div><div class="t m2fc x3c h19 ya13 ff1 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">his remedy earnestly and clearly, as a careful study of verse 8 reveals. </div><div class="t m6d0 x5f h1a y7f8 ff4 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">What universal principle lies behind the observation Peter makes in his </div><div class="t m3f8 xb h1a y4 ff4 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">reasoned response to the doubters&apos; negative outlook on Christ&apos;s return? </div><div class="t m6d1 xb h1a ya14 ff4 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">2 Peter 3:8. </div><div class="t m57c x5f h19 ya15 ff1 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The persuasiveness of Peter&apos;s exhortation, &quot;be not ignorant of this one </div><div class="t m515 x3c h19 y34c ff1 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">thing,&quot; is better expressed in the paraphrase &quot;let not this one fact escape </div><div class="t m1cc x3c h19 y34d ff1 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">your attention.&quot; Who could resist such a plea?
