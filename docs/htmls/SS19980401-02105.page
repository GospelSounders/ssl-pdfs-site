She enjoys </div><div class="t m42c x10 he y964 ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">school now. But it wasn&apos;t always so. She used to attend a public </div><div class="t m6f6 x10 he y965 ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">school, but competition for grades was fierce, and Hitomi began to </div><div class="t m472 x10 he y966 ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">show signs of stress. Her mother worried about the effect the stress </div><div class="t m284 x10 he y967 ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was having on Hitomi&apos;s health. She discussed her concerns with </div><div class="t m14a x28 he y968 ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">her neighbor, who suggested she send Hitomi to the Okinawa </div><div class="t m552 x28 he y778 ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Saniku Elementary School, a Seventh-day Adventist mission school. </div><div class="t m6af x28 he y969 ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Hitomi&apos;s mother was not a Christian; in fact she was an atheist. But </div><div class="t m490 x28 he y77a ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">she wondered if a Christian school really could help her daughter. </div><div class="t m4b9 x60 he y77b ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Hitomi was not sure she wanted to change schools, but right </div><div class="t m55b x28 he y77c ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">away she noticed a difference. Her classmates and teachers were </div><div class="t m22c x28 he y77d ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">kind and hepful to one another, not competing. In fact, when one </div><div class="t m1bd x28 he y7b ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">boy had difficulty with a subject, other children helped him. Hitomi </div><div class="t m3a2 x28 he y96a ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">began to relax and enjoy her studies. </div><div class="t m29a x1d he y96b ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Public schools held classes six days a week. But at the Adventist </div><div class="t m50 x28 he y780 ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">school, Saturday classes met at the church. Class was not compul-</div><div class="t m3b x28 he y96c ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sory, but Hitomi had heard her friends talk about Sabbath School, </div><div class="t m6f7 x28 he y96d ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and she decided to go to see what it was like. Hitomi enjoyed </div><div class="t m51 xd0 he y96e ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Sabbath School ; it was actually fun! She told her mother about it. </div><div class="t m35c xd0 he y96f ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Mother decided to go. She wanted to know what her children were </div><div class="t m540 xd0 he y90b ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">being taught. Little by little, Hitomi&apos;s mother was led to Jesus. </div><div class="t m109 x1d he y90c ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">As Mother studied the Bible, she became convicted that she </div><div class="t m2ce xd0 he yca ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">needed to make things right with her mother-in-law. For all her </div><div class="t m327 xd0 he y90d ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">married life her mother-in-law had made her life miserable. But </div><div class="t m34b xd0 he y970 ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">now she knew she would have no peace until she asked her mother-</div><div class="t m6f8 xd0 he y971 ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in-law&apos;s forgiveness. After months of struggle, she called her mother-</div><div class="t m317 x29 he y972 ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in-law and made amends. What joy and peace flooded her heart! </div><div class="t m391 x1e he y973 ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Soon Hitomi&apos;s mother was baptized.
