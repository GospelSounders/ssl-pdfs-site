(See Num. 9:15-23.) Even when the </div><div class="t m15b x2e h20 y51f ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">people were unfaithful to God, the cloud remained to guide them. </div><div class="t m1f8 x2e h1f y215 ff1 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">THINK IT THROUGH: What are the implications of Jesus&apos; promise in </div><div class="t m344 x2e h1f y161 ff1 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Hebrews 13:5? </div><div class="t m438 xf h20 y163 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Israel no sooner had begun their march than God commanded Moses to </div><div class="t m39a x2e h20 y164 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">turn south, thus keeping the sea on their left.
