Eni was a </div><div class="t m3bd x4a hb y5a9 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">respected spirit medium and had many clients among the high society </div><div class="t ma7 x4a hb y5aa ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of Rio de Janeiro. Her brother, Amandio, was an Adventist, and for </div><div class="t m15 x4a hb y5ab ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">years he had tried to share his faith with Eni, but his efforts only </div><div class="t m5af x4a hb y5ac ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">irritated her. Finally she told him to leave and refused to speak to him. </div><div class="t m19a x4a hb y5ad ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">He left, but he did not stop praying for her. </div><div class="t m213 x12 hb y5ae ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Then came news that she had cancer. Shaken, Eni turned to her </div><div class="t m4ba x4a hb y77b ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">idols and asked Oxala, her most powerful deity, to help her. But she </div><div class="t m65 x4a hb y5b0 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">received no answer to her prayers. Desperate, she finally decided to </div><div class="t m297 x4a hb y77c ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">call her brother. </div><div class="t m1b2 x12 hb y5b2 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Amandio listened to her story and tried to comfort her with verses </div><div class="t m5b0 x4b hb y5b3 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">from the Psalms. &quot;Are you ready to know Jesus?&quot; Amandio asked her. </div><div class="t m329 x12 hb y5b4 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;No!&quot; she answered defiantly, and hung up. </div><div class="t m5b1 x12 hb y77d ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Amandio continued praying, and hundreds of miles away in Rio de </div><div class="t m5b2 x4b hb y77e ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Janeiro, the Holy Spirit continued working in Eni&apos;s life. One night she </div><div class="t m29f x4b hb y5b7 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">dreamed that her mother spoke to her. &quot;You must get out of this </div><div class="t m5b3 x4b hb y77f ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">religion or you will be lost forever,&quot; the voice said. Eni was afraid to </div><div class="t m5b4 x4b hb y5b9 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">get rid of her idols, but she also feared disobeying her mother&apos;s voice. </div><div class="t m13b x12 hb y780 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">News of Eni&apos;s illness spread, and Christians began visiting her. </div><div class="t m5b5 x4b hb y5bc ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Someone suggested that they destroy the idols in her home. </div><div class="t m154 x12 hb y781 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;No,&quot; Eni said. &quot;I placed them here, and I will remove them.&quot; </div><div class="t m172 x6d hb y5be ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Eni&apos;s cancerous cyst continued to grow. One morning Eni knelt </div><div class="t m305 x4b hb y782 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">down and poured out her heart to God. &quot;Jesus, I am tired of stepping </div><div class="t m5b6 x4b hb y5c0 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">on Your Word. Change my life.&quot; Suddenly a bright light surrounded </div><div class="t m46f x4b hb y783 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">her. A hand touched her, and Eni knew she was healed. In a moment </div><div class="t m5b7 x4b hb y5c2 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the light disappeared, and Eni fell asleep. </div><div class="t m15f x6d hb y5c3 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The next day Eni went to her doctor for a biopsy. The doctor was </div><div class="t m5b8 x4b hb y784 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">surprised to find the test showed no cancer. Eni hurried home and called </div><div class="t m5b9 x2a hb y5c5 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">her brother. &quot;Would your church accept me the way I am?&quot; Eni asked. </div><div class="t m229 x6d hb y785 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Of course the church will accept you!&quot; Amandio answered. &quot;There </div><div class="t m5ba x2a hb y786 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">is a church near your home. Ask the pastor for Bible studies.&quot; Eni soon </div><div class="t m5bb x2a hb y787 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">began Bible studies, and the next time she called her brother, she told </div><div class="t m5bc x2a hb y788 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">him she planned to be baptized. </div><div class="t m41c x70 hb y789 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">At her baptism, Eni testified of the influence of her brother&apos;s </div><div class="t m5bd x2a hb y78a ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">testimony and his constant prayers. Two years after her own </div><div class="t m5be x2a hb y78b ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">baptism, her husband, Sebastiao, was baptized, as well.
