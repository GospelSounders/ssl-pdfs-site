Jose was not seriously </div><div class="t m33d x1c hd y287 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">injured, but his friend suffered massive head injuries and lay </div><div class="t m517 x1c hd y5dc ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">unconscious in the intensive care unit of the nearest hospital. </div><div class="t m2c8 x1d hd y18b ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">After being released from the hospital, Jose went to the police </div><div class="t m4da x1c hd y2a0 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">station to file an accident report. It was after midnight when he </div><div class="t m52f x1c hd y591 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">finally started for home. He had not called his mother to tell her of </div><div class="t m2e4 x1c hd y7ef ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the accident, because he knew she would worry. </div><div class="t m3ec x1d hd y6c2 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">As he made his way home along the quiet city streets, Jose </div><div class="t m41c x1c hd y784 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">thought about the accident, thought about his friend&apos;s life, which </div><div class="t m68e x1c hd y785 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">hung on a thread because of another driver&apos;s inattention. Jose </div><div class="t m533 x1c hd y8a1 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">realized that his own life could have ended that same instant. He </div><div class="t mf9 x1c hd y787 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">knew that if he had died his life would have been without purpose </div><div class="t m2d8 x1c hd y68e ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and without God. </div><div class="t m103 x1d hd y789 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">He remembered the times he had made fun of God and of his </div><div class="t m24b x1c hd y272 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">mother&apos;s faith.

When he finished he looked at her </div><div class="t m212 x1c hd y78c ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and said, &quot;Mother, I want to give my life to Jesus.&quot; Mother and son </div><div class="t mfa x1c hd y693 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">knelt together, while Jose asked Jesus to take over his life. </div><div class="t m2d1 x1d hd y6d4 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Jose&apos;s friend died a few hours later. And in a sense, Jose also </div><div class="t m48a x1c hd y6d5 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">died that day.
