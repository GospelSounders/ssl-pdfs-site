As a fisherman, he spent<span class="_ _8"></span> </div><div class="t m0 x6f h6 y223 ff14 fs4 fc3 sc0 ls16 ws5e">weeks at a time on board a ship. One day one of the sailors gave him </div><div class="t m0 x6f h6 y224 ff14 fs4 fc3 sc0 ls16 ws9e">a book about God. He read it with great interest. Following the book’s </div><div class="t m0 x6f h6 y225 ff14 fs4 fc3 sc0 ls16 ws6">instructions, Fabrice prayed his first prayer. </div><div class="t m0 x43 h6 y226 ff14 fs4 fc3 sc0 ls16 ws36">Fabrice wondered which Christian faith was the true path to God. He </div><div class="t m0 x6f h6 y227 ff14 fs4 fc3 sc0 ls16 ws41">really didn’t know who God was or where to find answers to his ques<span class="ls2 ws3">-</span></div><div class="t m0 x6f h6 y228 ff14 fs4 fc3 sc0 ls16 ws6">tions, but he continued praying in the only way he knew. </div><div class="t m0 x43 h6 y229 ff14 fs4 fc3 sc0 ls1f ws126">Then, while visiting a friend, he met a young woman who was staying </div><div class="t m0 x6f h6 y22a ff14 fs4 fc3 sc0 ls1f wsac">with his friend’s family. Fabrice realized that she was somehow differ<span class="ls2 ws3">-</span></div><div class="t m0 x6f h6 y22b ff14 fs4 fc3 sc0 ls1f ws7a">ent, and he learned that she was a Seventh-day Adventist Christian. He </div><div class="t m0 x6f h6 y22c ff14 fs4 fc3 sc0 ls1f ws6">told her of his search for God, and she invited him to church. </div><div class="t m0 x43 h6 y22d ff14 fs4 fc3 sc0 ls16 wsa8">The couple was married, but Fabrice’s job kept him away from home </div><div class="t m0 x6f h6 y22e ff14 fs4 fc3 sc0 ls16 wsba">and slowed his search for God.
