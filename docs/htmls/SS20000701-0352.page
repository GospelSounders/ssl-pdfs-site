Acts 12 is like </div><div class="t m101 x6d h17 y2d3 ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">parentheses. It could have started off, &quot;Meanwhile, in Jerusalem . . .&quot; </div><div class="t m10e x19 h17 y52b ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">then proceeded with the story of Peter&apos;s deliverance from prison. The </div><div class="t m537 x19 h17 y53e ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">end of the chapter closes the parentheses, declaring that &quot;Barnabas </div><div class="t m3ec x19 h17 y2d4 ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and Saul returned from Jerusalem, when they had fulfilled their minis-</div><div class="t m538 x19 h17 y53f ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">try&quot; (12:25). There John Mark joined them to be their helper (Acts </div><div class="t m539 x6d h17 y2d5 ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">12:25; 13:5). Because Mark&apos;s mother frequently opened her home to </div><div class="t ma1 x19 h17 y540 ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the apostles, he would already have spent much time with many of the </div><div class="t m90 x19 h17 y2d7 ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">well-known people of the early church. </div><div class="t m53a x1a h23 y2d9 ff3 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">What happened with John Mark in Perga?

Acts 15:37-39. </div><div class="t m53b x5d h17 y298 ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;This desertion caused Paul to judge Mark unfavorably, and even </div><div class="t m223 x19 h17 y299 ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">severely, for a time. Barnabas, on the other hand, was inclined to excuse </div><div class="t m270 x19 h17 y1c ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">him because of his inexperience.

But Acts 13:14 perhaps gives us a clue. The </div><div class="t m53d x19 h17 y543 ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">road to Pisidian Antioch was located on a plateau 3,600 feet (1,080 </div><div class="t m53e x19 h17 y544 ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">meters) above sea level. The only road there was a difficult passage </div><div class="t m53f x19 h17 y537 ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">through the Taurus mountains. And if that wasn&apos;t bad enough, the </div><div class="t m540 x19 h17 yab ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">route was haunted by criminals. Perhaps the knowledge that this </div><div class="t m1ec x19 h17 y131 ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">would be the next part of their journey convinced John Mark to return </div><div class="t m39a x19 h17 y365 ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">home.
