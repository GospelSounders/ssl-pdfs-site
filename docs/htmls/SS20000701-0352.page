Acts 12 is like </div><div class="t m101 x6e h19 y2d4 ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">parentheses. It could have started off, &quot;Meanwhile, in Jerusalem . . .&quot; </div><div class="t m10e x1a h19 y52c ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">then proceeded with the story of Peter&apos;s deliverance from prison. The </div><div class="t m537 x1a h19 y53f ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">end of the chapter closes the parentheses, declaring that &quot;Barnabas </div><div class="t m3ec x1a h19 y2d5 ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and Saul returned from Jerusalem, when they had fulfilled their minis-</div><div class="t m538 x1a h19 y540 ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">try&quot; (12:25). There John Mark joined them to be their helper (Acts </div><div class="t m539 x6e h19 y2d6 ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">12:25; 13:5). Because Mark&apos;s mother frequently opened her home to </div><div class="t ma1 x1a h19 y541 ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the apostles, he would already have spent much time with many of the </div><div class="t m90 x1a h19 y2d8 ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">well-known people of the early church. </div><div class="t m53a x1b h25 y2da ff3 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">What happened with John Mark in Perga?

Acts 15:37-39. </div><div class="t m53b x5e h19 y299 ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;This desertion caused Paul to judge Mark unfavorably, and even </div><div class="t m223 x1a h19 y29a ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">severely, for a time. Barnabas, on the other hand, was inclined to excuse </div><div class="t m270 x1a h19 y1d ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">him because of his inexperience.

But Acts 13:14 perhaps gives us a clue. The </div><div class="t m53d x1a h19 y544 ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">road to Pisidian Antioch was located on a plateau 3,600 feet (1,080 </div><div class="t m53e x1a h19 y545 ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">meters) above sea level. The only road there was a difficult passage </div><div class="t m53f x1a h19 y538 ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">through the Taurus mountains. And if that wasn&apos;t bad enough, the </div><div class="t m540 x1a h19 yac ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">route was haunted by criminals. Perhaps the knowledge that this </div><div class="t m1ec x1a h19 y132 ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">would be the next part of their journey convinced John Mark to return </div><div class="t m39a x1a h19 y366 ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">home.
