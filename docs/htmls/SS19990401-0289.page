He </div><div class="t m45f x36 hb y725 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">wanted to take a Bible home after the meeting, but the usher told him </div><div class="t m123 x36 hb y4fe ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that he would have to attend all the meetings before he could have the </div><div class="t m4fd x36 hb y271 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Bible. Samson tried to buy a Bible in town, but the shops were closed. </div><div class="t m3a7 x36 hb y726 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Finally he borrowed his neighbor&apos;s Bible. </div><div class="t m13d x29 hb y4c5 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">That night he sat beside the fire and told his relatives what he had </div><div class="t m2e x36 hb y727 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">heard at the meeting that day. He could remember only one Bible </div><div class="t m60e x36 hb y4c7 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">reference that the pastor had quoted: 1 Thessalonians 4:13-18. He read </div><div class="t m2b5 x36 hb y728 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">these verses, which explain how Jesus will return to rescue those who </div><div class="t m12c x36 hb y729 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">love Him to live with Him forever. </div><div class="t m63a x29 hb y72a ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Later that night Samson dreamed that someone came into his </div><div class="t m506 x36 hb y4ca ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">bedroom and crushed his head against the bed. When he awoke, pain </div><div class="t m313 x36 hb y27b ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">shot through his head. It subsided enough so that he could attend the </div><div class="t m631 x36 hb y72b ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">meetings, but later the pain returned with a force that made him sick. </div><div class="t m249 x36 hb y72c ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">This happened every day, but the pain did not stop Samson from </div><div class="t m2b x36 hb y4cc ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">attending the meetings or accepting the truths he heard. The pastor </div><div class="t m600 x36 hb y72d ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">learned about Samson&apos;s mysterious headaches and prayed for him. </div><div class="t m41e x36 hb y72e ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">After the meetings ended, he took Samson to Juba for a check-up. </div><div class="t ma4 x75 hb y72f ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Samson stayed with his aunt while in Juba to see the doctor. His two </div><div class="t m19a x36 hb y730 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">brothers, Wisely and Paul, were also living with her while they at-</div><div class="t m2be x36 hb y731 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tended school. Samson invited them to study the Bible with him, and </div><div class="t m1a4 x36 hb y3b5 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">on Saturday he took his brothers to church. But when his aunt learned </div><div class="t m33 x36 hb y2a5 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that Samson no longer followed the family&apos;s religion, she became </div><div class="t mb4 x36 hb y6dc ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">angry and hid their Bibles. The pastor gave Samson and his brothers </div><div class="t m26c x36 hb y732 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">three more Bibles. </div><div class="t m21e x75 hb y733 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Samson shared his growing faith with neighbors as well, and in-</div><div class="t m89 x3c hb y734 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">vited them to study the Bible with him.
