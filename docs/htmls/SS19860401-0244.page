First, the point </div><div class="t m40f x56 h32 y731 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">he makes in 1:5-14 is important for his exhortation at 2:1-4. Here he con-</div><div class="t m2d8 x56 h32 y732 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">trasts &apos;the message declared by angels&apos; (2:2) with the salvation &apos;declared </div><div class="t m56b x56 h32 y733 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">at first by the Lord&apos; (2:3). The former refers to the giving of the law at </div><div class="t m59 x56 h32 y734 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Sinai, where as Galatians 3:19 puts it, angels acted as intermediaries (see </div><div class="t m56c x56 h32 y735 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">also Deuteronomy 33:2). The latter refers to the giving of the gospel, </div><div class="t m341 x56 h32 y736 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">spoken by the Lord Himself. That is, the apostle is showing </div><div class="t m56d xc1 h32 y5be ff6 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">how much </div><div class="t m333 x4b h32 y737 ff6 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">greater </div><div class="t md xc4 h32 y5bf ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">is the privilege of Christians—and so, how much greater the peril </div><div class="t m1ef x56 h32 y5c0 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of neglect. The argument is from the lesser to the greater. If the people </div><div class="t m351 x56 h32 y738 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">who disobeyed at the time of Moses received punishment, how shall we </div><div class="t m56e x56 h32 y739 ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">think to escape if we ignore salvation so great—as greater as is the Lord </div><div class="t m56f x56 h32 y73a ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">than angels? </div><div class="t m570 x4f h32 y73b ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;This explanation, however, does not seem sufficient in itself. Granted </div><div class="t m571 x56 h32 y73c ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that the apostle </div><div class="t m469 x6a h32 y73c ff6 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">employs </div><div class="t m572 x1c h32 yd ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the point of the Son&apos;s superiority to angels in </div><div class="t m37f x56 h32 y73d ff3 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">2:1-4, its long development in 1:5-14 calls for further explanation.
