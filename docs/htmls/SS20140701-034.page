Our Savior taught many things pertaining to our spiritual and practical </div><div class="t m2 x7 h9 y4b ffa fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws2d">lives. He presented His teachings to different audiences, being careful to adapt His </div><div class="t m2 x7 h9 y4c ffa fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws2e">method to each person. Sometimes He preached a sermon; other times He dialogued </div><div class="t m2 x7 h9 y4d ffa fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws27">with individuals or with groups. Sometimes He spoke openly; other times He had </div><div class="t m2 x7 h9 y4e ffa fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws2f">to conceal the meaning of His words.
