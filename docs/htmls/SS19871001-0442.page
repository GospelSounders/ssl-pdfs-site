Why do you suppose that he </div><div class="t m216 x23 hd y5cf ff1 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">did not present the entire story? </div><div class="t m295 x3d h17 y5d0 ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">There are many details in this account that puzzle us today, although they </div><div class="t m4e x23 h17 yb ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">must have been plain to the book&apos;s readers when it first was written. We do </div><div class="t mf8 x23 h17 y9c ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">not know why the nearer kinsman is not named. Some have suggested that </div><div class="t m4d x23 h17 y9d ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">this was done to spare the man and his descendants embarrassment. Others </div><div class="t m42a x23 h17 y5d1 ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">have concluded that not naming him was a literary device intended to show </div><div class="t m3dc x23 h17 y9e ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that his name was unimportant to the message of the story. Nor do we under-</div><div class="t m42b x23 h17 y9f ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">stand fully how Naomi could offer the land for sale because normally, a </div><div class="t m18d x23 h17 y5d2 ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">widow did not inherit her husband&apos;s land.

The basic principle is laid down in these words: &apos;The land shall not </div><div class="t m7c x2a h17 y5eb ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">be sold for ever: for the land is mine; for ye are strangers and sojourners with </div><div class="t m431 x2a h17 y5ec ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">me.
