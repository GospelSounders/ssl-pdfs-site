Without the Spirit&apos;s special enlightenment there can be no </div><div class="t m11e x76 he yf6 ff2 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">genuine understanding of the spiritual message of the Bible. Before </div><div class="t m11f x76 he yf7 ff2 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">beginning your study each day pray that the Holy Spirit will instruct </div><div class="t m120 x76 he yf8 ff2 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">your mind. Not only does He make difficult things plain, but also He </div><div class="t m121 x76 he yf9 ff2 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">brings Christ to your heart as your indwelling righteousness (Rom. 8:9, </div><div class="t m122 x77 he yfa ff2 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">10). </div><div class="t m123 x72 hb yfb ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Read through the entire lesson </div><div class="t m124 x57 he yfb ff2 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in the quarterly at the beginning </div><div class="t m125 x77 he yfc ff2 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of the week.

The parts of the whole can be remembered better when you un-</div><div class="t m127 x77 he yff ff2 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">derstand the overall message. </div><div class="t m108 x72 hb y100 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Study one section of the lesson each day. </div><div class="t m128 x78 he y101 ff2 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">It is not always neces-</div><div class="t m129 x77 he y102 ff2 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sary to look up every verse to find the answer to the question.

If you discover problem words, phrases, or ideas, go to a good </div><div class="t m12e x77 he y107 ff2 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Bible commentary or dictionary for clarification. The aim of your study </div><div class="t m12f x77 he y108 ff2 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">is always to gain a closer walk with God. Factual information is helpful, </div><div class="t mf2 x77 he y109 ff2 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">but spiritual insight is essential. Do not worry if you do not understand </div><div class="t m130 x77 he y10a ff2 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">everything in the book, chapter, or verse being discussed. No one under-</div><div class="t m131 x77 he y10b ff2 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">stands everything. God&apos;s Word is a mine of truth that always contains </div><div class="t m132 x77 he y10c ff2 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">much more than our finite human capacity is capable of grasping. Even </div><div class="t m133 x77 he y10d ff2 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">so, we are blessed when we make the effort to receive the blessing the </div><div class="t m134 x77 he y10e ff2 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Lord has for us. </div><div class="t m135 x79 hb y10f ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Use the writings of Ellen G.
