Jonah is told to go, and the next thing we </div><div class="t m252 x4f h16 y45d ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">know, he&apos;s there. No mention is made of the long journey Jonah </div><div class="t m141 x4f h16 y415 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">would have had to make. This is in direct contrast to his initial travels </div><div class="t m538 x4f h16 y4f8 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in the first two chapters. Instead, our attention is now taken immedi-</div><div class="t m129 x4f h16 y4ef ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ately to the city of Nineveh. There was a reason for the description of </div><div class="t m203 x4f h16 y4f0 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Jonah&apos;s first journey: It exposed the nature of Jonah&apos;s rebellion against </div><div class="t m18e x4f h16 y45f ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">God. But now that Jonah obeys, the journey is not important to detail. </div><div class="t m3e8 x5b h27 y4f9 ff4 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">How is Nineveh described? Jon. 3:3. </div><div class="t m32a x8a h16 y60e ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">As in Jonah 1:2, Nineveh is again described as a great city. (The </div><div class="t m539 x4f h16 y60f ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">literal meaning of the phrase is: &quot;a great city to God.&quot;) And indeed, </div><div class="t m53a x46 h16 y610 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">it was large and important by the standards of the time. We can also </div><div class="t m53b x46 h16 y611 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">be sure that Nineveh is &quot;great&quot; to God in light of all the trouble He </div><div class="t m53c x46 h16 y612 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">takes to get Jonah there! The size of Nineveh is suggested by the </div><div class="t m53d x46 h16 y613 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">final phrase in verse 3: &quot;three days&apos; journey.&quot; The words in the </div><div class="t m53e x46 h16 y614 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">original language read more literally as &quot;a walk of three days.&quot; Such </div><div class="t ma1 x46 h16 y615 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">a designation in ancient records can suggest a day&apos;s journey in from </div><div class="t m18f x46 h16 y616 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the suburbs, one day for business, and one day for the return. This </div><div class="t m56 x46 h16 y617 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">interpretation fits well with verse 4. </div><div class="t m4a9 x6b h27 y618 ff4 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">God commissions a Hebrew prophet to go to the capital city </div><div class="t m196 x12 h27 y619 ff4 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of Assyria, taking a message of judgment.
