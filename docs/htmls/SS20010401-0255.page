Nobody dared cross him. A datu (chief) and a fierce head-</div><div class="t m52c x3d h11 y38 ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">hunter, he often joined in bloody tribal conflicts with other Manobo </div><div class="t m52d x3d h11 y672 ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">villages. I remember my father hiding by the window in our hut and </div><div class="t m492 x3d h11 y673 ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">shooting passersby with his bow and arrows. When he hit one, he </div><div class="t m12a x3d h11 ydf ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">would laugh with pleasure as the victim crawled away in pain. To </div><div class="t m162 x3d h11 y674 ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">my father, this was a game. His family did not escape his heartless </div><div class="t m52e x3d h11 y675 ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ways. We children trembled when he roared at us like a lion. </div><div class="t m52f x4 h11 y676 ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Then student missionaries from Mountain View College came to </div><div class="t m2f3 x3d h11 y677 ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">our village to open a school and teach the children to read and write. </div><div class="t m1f7 x3d h11 y678 ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">My father was not interested in the school or the missionaries, but </div><div class="t m4cb x3d h11 y679 ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">other villagers were glad for a school to teach their children. </div><div class="t m103 x4 h11 y67a ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Eagerly the villagers worked to build the schoolhouse. Women </div><div class="t m236 x3d h11 y67b ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and children gathered grass for the roof, and the men cut wood for </div><div class="t m51a x3d h11 y67c ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the walls. It took us just a week to finish our school. </div><div class="t m2b0 x4 h11 y1d5 ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Our new teachers did not smoke like most lowlanders, and they </div><div class="t m51e x3d h11 y67d ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">loved to sing. They made school fun, and we learned many things. I </div><div class="t m530 x3d h11 y67e ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was so shy that I hid in the corner of the school room during classes, </div><div class="t m531 x3d h11 y67f ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">but I listened attentively to the lessons and Bible stories they told. I </div><div class="t m2cd x3d h11 y680 ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">admired the teachers for their good example and kindness to us. </div><div class="t m39e x3d h11 y681 ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Secretly I dreamed of becoming a teacher one day. </div><div class="t m3b6 x40 h11 y682 ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">When my brothers and sisters and I wanted to be baptized, we </div><div class="t me8 x68 h11 y683 ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">had to ask our father.

On my visits home I </div><div class="t m214 x68 h11 y686 ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">began to sense changes in my father. He seemed gentler, and his </div><div class="t m69 x68 h11 y1e1 ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">prejudice against the missionaries was fading.
