Nobody dared cross him. A datu (chief) and a fierce head-</div><div class="t m52c x3e h13 y39 ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">hunter, he often joined in bloody tribal conflicts with other Manobo </div><div class="t m52d x3e h13 y673 ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">villages. I remember my father hiding by the window in our hut and </div><div class="t m492 x3e h13 y674 ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">shooting passersby with his bow and arrows. When he hit one, he </div><div class="t m12a x3e h13 ye0 ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">would laugh with pleasure as the victim crawled away in pain. To </div><div class="t m162 x3e h13 y675 ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">my father, this was a game. His family did not escape his heartless </div><div class="t m52e x3e h13 y676 ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ways. We children trembled when he roared at us like a lion. </div><div class="t m52f x5 h13 y677 ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Then student missionaries from Mountain View College came to </div><div class="t m2f3 x3e h13 y678 ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">our village to open a school and teach the children to read and write. </div><div class="t m1f7 x3e h13 y679 ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">My father was not interested in the school or the missionaries, but </div><div class="t m4cb x3e h13 y67a ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">other villagers were glad for a school to teach their children. </div><div class="t m103 x5 h13 y67b ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Eagerly the villagers worked to build the schoolhouse.

It took us just a week to finish our school. </div><div class="t m2b0 x5 h13 y1d6 ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Our new teachers did not smoke like most lowlanders, and they </div><div class="t m51e x3e h13 y67e ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">loved to sing. They made school fun, and we learned many things. I </div><div class="t m530 x3e h13 y67f ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was so shy that I hid in the corner of the school room during classes, </div><div class="t m531 x3e h13 y680 ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">but I listened attentively to the lessons and Bible stories they told.
