H. Zachary </div><div class="t m3f6 x3a hc y9c8 ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">For years Leonid Kozlov lived a double life. A skilled pop music </div><div class="t m1fb x15 hc y9c9 ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">singer and guitarist, he enjoyed a wide following when he per-</div><div class="t m50e x15 hc y9ca ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">formed. But Leonid had a dark side. He had created a twisted </div><div class="t m719 x15 hc y9cb ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">theology that convinced him that God was helping him to steal from </div><div class="t m66b x15 hc y9cc ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">others, including his friends, and not get caught. Leonid was a thief. </div><div class="t m2f3 x3a hc y66 ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">He wore a good luck charm, a crucifix, around his neck on a </div><div class="t m27e x15 hc y9cd ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">golden chain. He believed this crucifix would protect him. One </div><div class="t m5d6 x15 hc y9ce ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">night while walking alone, Leonid was attacked by a stranger. In </div><div class="t m376 x15 hc y9cf ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the moonlight he saw the man&apos;s knife being raised above his head. </div><div class="t m3db x15 hc y9d0 ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Instinctively, Leonid raised his hands to deflect the blow. He felt </div><div class="t m71a x15 hc y9d1 ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the sting of the knife on his hand, then on his chest. In a split </div><div class="t m4b3 x15 hc y9d2 ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">second Leonid&apos;s life and his sins flashed before him. He fell to the </div><div class="t md9 x15 hc y9d3 ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ground, and the attacker fled. He lay there several seconds, think-</div><div class="t m3e3 x15 hc y5e ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ing that his end had come. Then he managed to get up and struggle </div><div class="t m3e3 x15 hc y9d4 ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">home. His mother washed the blood away while they waited for an </div><div class="t m23e x15 hc y9d5 ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ambulance. In the hospital the doctor cared for his wounds. </div><div class="t m312 x3a hc y9d6 ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The next day Leonid noticed that his crucifix was badly dam-</div><div class="t m6f6 x15 hc y9d7 ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">aged. The blade of the knife must have hit it. As Leonid examined </div><div class="t m71b xf hc y9d8 ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">his lucky charm, he thought, </div><div class="t m232 xd hc y9d9 ff8 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">There is a lesson here for me.

I must obey Him.&quot; </div><div class="t m239 x7e hc y9db ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Leonid burst into tears as he considered his </div><div class="t md7 xf hc y9dc ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">wicked life in the light of God&apos;s mercy. Leonid began to search for </div><div class="t mdf xf hc y9dd ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">answers to his spiritual questions. </div><div class="t m302 x21 hc y9de ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Several weeks later Leonid learned about a series of Bible </div><div class="t m7c xf hc y9df ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">lectures being held in the city. He attended faithfully. Night by </div><div class="t m59 xf hc y9e0 ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">night he thrilled to the new truths he was learning from the Bible. </div><div class="t m46f xf hc y9e1 ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">In Jesus he found new hope and a new purpose in life. The Holy </div><div class="t mcc xf hc y9e2 ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Spirit brought conviction to his heart. He gave his life to Christ. </div><div class="t m5cc x21 hc y9e3 ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Leonid began sharing his new life in Jesus with others. Instead of </div><div class="t m543 x3f hc y9e4 ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">singing pop music, he began singing songs </div><div class="t m67a x3f hc y9e5 ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to God&apos;s glory in churches and evangelistic </div><div class="t m40e xcd hc y9e6 ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">meetings.
