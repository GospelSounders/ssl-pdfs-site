Why did John say he wrote what he did about </div><div class="t m150 x18 h7 y12a ff5 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the life of Jesus? In what ways does the whole Bible reflect that </div><div class="t m151 x18 h7 y12b ff5 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">same purpose? </div><div class="t m152 x16 h2 y12c ff1 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Jesus&apos; ministry from His baptism to His ascension covered about </div><div class="t m153 x18 h2 y12d ff1 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">three and a half years (1,260 days!).

More than ninety-seven percent of Jesus&apos; ministry is left out of </div><div class="t m158 x18 h2 y132 ff1 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">John&apos;s Gospel.
