Why did John say he wrote what he did about </div><div class="t m150 x19 h9 y12b ff5 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the life of Jesus? In what ways does the whole Bible reflect that </div><div class="t m151 x19 h9 y12c ff5 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">same purpose? </div><div class="t m152 x17 h3 y12d ff1 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Jesus&apos; ministry from His baptism to His ascension covered about </div><div class="t m153 x19 h3 y12e ff1 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">three and a half years (1,260 days!).
