H. Zachary </div><div class="t m310 x69 ha y8b2 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Tomaszyk Stanislaw is well known in his province of Poland. </div><div class="t m221 xb1 ha y8b2 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0"> </div><div class="t m2b1 x20 ha y8b3 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">During his youth he had won many awards in the sport of weight </div><div class="t m286 x20 ha y8b4 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">lifting. He was proud of his muscular physique; he enjoyed excel-</div><div class="t m33e x20 ha y8b5 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">lent health and looked forward to a good life. </div><div class="t m1a1 x9a ha y8b6 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">But shortly after his fortieth birthday he began to experience </div><div class="t m1b4 x11 ha y8b7 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">considerable pain in his joints. Stiffness and weakness set in. Soon </div><div class="t mea x20 ha y8b8 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">this strong man had to use a wheelchair to get around. </div><div class="t m3c5 x69 ha y8b9 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">One day while browsing in a book shop, he found a book on </div><div class="t m507 x20 ha y8ba ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">health. As he leafed through it, he decided he must have this book. </div><div class="t m3a x20 ha y8bb ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">He noticed that it was published by one of the sects in Poland that </div><div class="t m24e x20 ha y8bc ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">his priest had warned parishioners about. But he bought it anyway. </div><div class="t m6c2 x9a ha y8bd ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">As he read the book, he found that the lifestyle suggestions </div><div class="t m281 x20 ha y8be ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">made sense to him. He adjusted his life in accordance with the </div><div class="t m2f3 x20 ha y8bf ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">book&apos;s suggestions. He gave up meat and began following the </div><div class="t m22f x20 ha y8c0 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">eight principles for good health: good nutrition, exercise, use of </div><div class="t m5fb x20 ha y8c1 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">water, sunshine, plenty of fresh air, temperance, adequate rest, </div><div class="t m3a4 x20 ha y8c2 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and trust in God. </div><div class="t m259 x9a ha y8c3 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Stanislaw noticed that the book often referred to the Bible. He </div><div class="t m227 x20 ha y8c4 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">purchased a Bible and began reading it. As he found new biblical </div><div class="t m3b1 x20 ha y8c5 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">principals, he put them into practice in his life. He was amazed at </div><div class="t m46e x20 ha y8c6 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the difference it made. As he continued reading the Bible, he </div><div class="t m581 x20 ha y8c7 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">realized that the Bible commands believers to keep Sabbath holy </div><div class="t me4 x20 ha y8c8 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">rather than Sunday. He began keeping the Sabbath. </div><div class="t m3a0 x9a ha y8c9 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Stanislaw&apos;s wife did not share Stanislaw&apos;s new religious enthu-</div><div class="t m3e x20 ha y8ca ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">siasm or the changes he was making in his life, and eventually she </div><div class="t m2df x20 ha y8cb ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">left him. Undaunted, Stanislaw began searching for people who </div><div class="t m6c3 x20 ha y8cc ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">followed the principles he had found in the health book. He searched </div><div class="t m34f x20 ha y8cd ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">for five years before he met an Adventist pastor who confirmed </div><div class="t m125 x20 ha y8ce ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that Seventh-day Adventists teach and practice the biblical and </div><div class="t m30f x78 ha y8cf ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">health principles he had found. Stanislaw is studying the Bible </div><div class="t m33e x20 ha y8d0 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">with the pastor and looks forward to being baptized. </div><div class="t m1a3 x21 ha y8d1 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">In every community honest souls are searching for a better life </div><div class="t m5b8 x78 ha y8d2 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">by improving their health, reducing their stress levels, and finding </div><div class="t m3c0 x20 ha y8d3 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">answers to their spiritual questions.
