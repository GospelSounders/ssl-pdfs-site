After receiving permis-</div><div class="t m20b x18 h25 y911 ff1 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sion from the leaders, the youth gathered jungle materials and </div><div class="t m2cd x52 h25 y912 ff1 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">built a shelter in which to hold public meetings. </div><div class="t mac xbe h25 y913 ff1 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">It was hard work in the tropical sun.
