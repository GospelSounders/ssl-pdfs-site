After receiving permis-</div><div class="t m20b x19 h29 y912 ff1 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sion from the leaders, the youth gathered jungle materials and </div><div class="t m2cd x53 h29 y913 ff1 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">built a shelter in which to hold public meetings. </div><div class="t mac xbf h29 y914 ff1 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">It was hard work in the tropical sun.

But the following </div><div class="t m1cb x53 h29 ya5d ff1 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">morning their hall was again in ruins. Again they rebuilt it.
