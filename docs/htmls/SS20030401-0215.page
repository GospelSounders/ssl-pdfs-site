My family worshiped Tigani </div><div class="t m1f1 x39 h2e y1da ff2 fs1e fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">(tee-GAH-neh), the supreme god in my village in Ghana. I knew </div><div class="t m1f2 x39 h2e y1db ff2 fs1e fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">no other religion until I was 16 and enrolled in a Catholic school, </div><div class="t m1f3 x39 h2e y1dc ff2 fs1e fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">where religion was a compulsory class. However, I never consid-</div><div class="t m1f4 x39 h2e y1dd ff2 fs1e fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ered Christ&apos;s love or His sacrifice for me personally. I finished </div><div class="t m1f5 x39 h2e y1de ff2 fs1e fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">school and forgot about Christianity. </div><div class="t m1f6 x4e h2e y1df ff2 fs1e fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I began working as a teacher in northern Ghana. One day I met </div><div class="t m15f x51 h2e y1e0 ff2 fs1e fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Andrew, a man who came from my home village. When we were </div><div class="t m1f7 x51 h2e y1e1 ff2 fs1e fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in elementary school this boy left our traditional religion to be-</div><div class="t m1f8 x51 h2e y1e2 ff2 fs1e fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">come a Christian. We all made fun of him. Now Andrew was a </div><div class="t m1f9 x51 h2e y1e3 ff2 fs1e fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">pastor. He often visited my house, and the conversation usually </div><div class="t m1fa x51 h2e y1e4 ff2 fs1e fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">turned to Christianity. Sometimes I felt that his talk about religion </div><div class="t m1fb x51 h2e y1e5 ff2 fs1e fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was a nuisance. I told him that the Christians I had known were no </div><div class="t m1fc x51 h2e y1e6 ff2 fs1e fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">better than the pagans. &quot;What is there in Christianity that would </div><div class="t m1f6 x51 h2e y1e7 ff2 fs1e fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">make me want to be one?&quot; I asked. </div><div class="t m1fd x2b h2e y1e8 ff2 fs1e fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">But Andrew did not give up. He invited me to a Revelation </div><div class="t m1fe x51 h2e y1e9 ff2 fs1e fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Seminar he was leading. I attended the first night just to please </div><div class="t m1ff x51 h2e y1ea ff2 fs1e fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Andrew, but I found the presentation made sense. I felt compelled </div><div class="t m175 x51 h2e y1eb ff2 fs1e fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to attend the entire series. Little by little I began to see the essence </div><div class="t m200 x51 h2e y21 ff2 fs1e fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of Christianity. </div><div class="t m201 x2b h2e y1ec ff2 fs1e fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">As I studied, I drew closer to Christ. I used to live for a drink, </div><div class="t m202 x3c h2e y1ed ff2 fs1e fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">but suddenly the taste of alcohol made me sick. Other vices I had </div><div class="t m203 x51 h2e y1ee ff2 fs1e fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">enjoyed now turned my stomach. I realized God was changing me, </div><div class="t m204 x51 h2e y1ef ff2 fs1e fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and eventually I asked Christ to take over my life. </div><div class="t m205 x2b h2e y1f0 ff2 fs1e fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">My wife is a Christian and attended the Revelation Seminar </div><div class="t m206 x58 h2e y1f1 ff2 fs1e fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">with me.
