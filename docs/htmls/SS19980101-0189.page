A large tropical </div><div class="t m53 x4f h19 y255 ff5 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ulcer on his leg caused him obvious pain. It was our first Sabbath </div><div class="t m2ab x4f h19 y9ae ff5 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">among the Iwam people on the May River in Papua New Guinea. </div><div class="t m29e xad h19 y511 ff5 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">After Sabbath, my husband, John, invited Sabien to the clinic, </div><div class="t m240 x4f h19 y9af ff5 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">where he treated his wound. Gradually his sore healed, and Sabien&apos;s </div><div class="t m52f x4f h19 y266 ff5 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">gratitude overflowed. </div><div class="t m732 xad h19 y6a ff5 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Sabien came faithfully to church, and eventually joined the </div><div class="t m187 x4f h19 y652 ff5 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">baptismal class. He was making wonderful progress. Then one day </div><div class="t m10f x4f h19 y9b0 ff5 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">a few weeks before the baptism, Sabien told John that he felt he </div><div class="t m929 x4f h19 y537 ff5 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">should not be baptized just yet. Surprised, John asked him why. </div><div class="t m425 x4f h19 y6d ff5 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Then Sabien explained that his father was building a house, and </div><div class="t m36d x4f h19 y661 ff5 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">when it was finished his father would give it to him. According to </div><div class="t m12d x4f h19 y9b1 ff5 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">local custom, when a house is completed, the entire village comes </div><div class="t m37e x4f h19 y9b2 ff5 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to a feast given by the homeowner. Sabien&apos;s father expected him to </div><div class="t m29c x4f h19 y9b3 ff5 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">attend the ceremony. But beer and betel nut would be served, and </div><div class="t m16a x43 h19 y9b4 ff5 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Sabien did not feel right joining the feast after being baptized. </div><div class="t m699 xad h19 y9b5 ff5 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">John and Sabien prayed about the situation, then John explained </div><div class="t m699 x43 h19 y9b6 ff5 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that the devil was using this ceremony to keep Sabien from follow-</div><div class="t m92a x43 h19 y9b7 ff5 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ing Jesus in baptism. Sabien decided he wanted to follow Jesus </div><div class="t m16d x43 h19 y9b8 ff5 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">now, and not wait until after the feast. We prayed earnestly that </div><div class="t m7f8 x43 h19 y52 ff5 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">God would be with Sabien as he told his father of his decision. </div><div class="t m34b x29 h19 y9b9 ff5 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Later Sabien returned to our home. He told us that his father had </div><div class="t m716 x43 h19 y9ba ff5 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">become angry when he learned that Sabien would not drink the </div><div class="t m14f x43 h19 y9bb ff5 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">beer and chew betel nut at his father&apos;s feast. He told Sabien not to </div><div class="t m2d9 x43 h19 y9bc ff5 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">come to the feast, that he would not give Sabien the house as he </div><div class="t m92b x43 h19 y9bd ff5 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">had planned. So Sabien, who had looked forward to living in the </div><div class="t m294 x43 h19 y9be ff5 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">new house, was forced to move his family into a tiny, one-room </div><div class="t m33a x43 h19 y9bf ff5 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">house. But Sabien was not discouraged. He had decided that it was </div><div class="t m73 x43 h19 y9c0 ff5 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">better to follow Jesus than to have a nice house. </div><div class="t m758 xb5 h19 y9c1 ff5 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Sabien was baptized. But that was not </div><div class="t m6d xe2 h19 y5e ff5 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the end of his tests of faith. </div><div class="t m3b9 x42 h19 y9c2 ff5 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">(continued next week) </div><div class="t m92c xa2 h25 y9c3 ff3 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Belinda Kent, her husband, John, and their </div><div class="t m921 x85 h25 yca ff3 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">four children serve as missionaries in Papua </div><div class="t m92d x1f h25 y7ec ff3 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">New Guinea under the auspices of Adventist </div><div class="t m7d6 x1f h25 y9c4 ff3 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Frontier Missions. </div><div class="t mfb x4e h19 y70d ff5 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Produced by the General Conference Office of N I i on . </div><div class="t m102 xc8 h19 y492 ff5 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">87 </div></div><div class="pi" data-data='{"ctm":[1.000000,0.000000,0.000000,1.000000,0.000000,0.000000]}'></div></div>
