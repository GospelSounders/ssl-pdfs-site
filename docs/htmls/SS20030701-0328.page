As the </div><div class="t m32c x38 h30 y381 ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Creator and the King of the universe, He is, nevertheless, still </div><div class="t m32d x38 h30 y382 ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">willing to be the Brother of His creatures; that is, His fallen, sinful, </div><div class="t m32e x30 h30 y383 ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and, oftentimes, pernicious creatures. Amazing! </div><div class="t m32f x49 h30 y17 ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The term </div><div class="t m2ab x11 h30 y17 ff6 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">brother </div><div class="t m125 x50 h30 y384 ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in this context points to an intimate closeness and </div><div class="t m191 x30 h30 y269 ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">relationship. Jesus and His followers are one family. Because of what </div><div class="t m2aa x30 h30 y385 ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">He went through and suffered, Jesus is one of us, and He will stay one </div><div class="t m330 x30 h30 y386 ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of us in spite of His royal dignity. Verse 14 emphasizes that He </div><div class="t m2c5 x30 h30 y387 ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">became a partaker of our flesh and blood, of our nature and of our </div><div class="t m1e4 x30 h30 y388 ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">experience. There&apos;s no question: By having become one of us, He can </div><div class="t m331 x30 h30 y389 ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">relate to us and we to Him, in a manner differently than were He to </div><div class="t m32e x30 h30 y38a ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">have never lived as a human being. What better way could there have </div><div class="t m180 x30 h30 y38b ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">been for God to become close to us other than by what Jesus did? </div><div class="t m332 x49 h2e y142 ff5 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Closeness may contain certain dangers. We can, for instance, </div><div class="t m1f1 x30 h2e y38c ff5 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">turn Jesus into nothing but our buddy. Though there is the friend-</div><div class="t m333 x30 h2e y38d ff5 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ship element (John 15:15) in our relationship with Christ, it isn&apos;t </div><div class="t m2ab x30 h2e y38e ff5 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the only term used to depict that relationship. What other images </div><div class="t m334 x30 h2e y38f ff5 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and terms does the Bible use to define that relationship? Matt. </div><div class="t m1cc x30 h2e y390 ff5 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">22:36; John 10:11; 20:28; 1 Tim. 1:1. </div><div class="t m1fc x4a h30 y391 ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">When it comes to the Bible and to God Himself, we often talk in </div><div class="t m335 x30 h30 y392 ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">paradoxes or contrasting pairs. There are three divine Personalities </div><div class="t m336 x30 h30 y393 ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and yet one Godhead. God is far away, unreachable yet present and </div><div class="t m337 x30 h30 y394 ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">close to us. Though not limited to time, He reveals Himself in time. </div><div class="t m27b x30 h30 y395 ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">We are already saved, and we still will be saved. </div><div class="t m338 x49 h30 y396 ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">It is not either/or but one and the other. We must keep these </div><div class="t m1bd x30 h30 y271 ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">different truths together, balanced with each other the best we can. Let </div><div class="t m339 x30 h30 y397 ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">us neither exclusively view Jesus as the distant Ruler of the universe </div><div class="t m188 x30 h30 y398 ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">nor treat Him just as a pal. Let us approach Him as our Brother in all </div><div class="t m33a x30 h30 y399 ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">due respect and love, because, no matter our intimacy, He&apos;s still the </div><div class="t m33b x30 h30 y39a ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Creator, and we are still the creature—and a great distance exists </div><div class="t m33c x30 h30 y39b ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">between the two. </div><div class="t m264 x1b h2e y273 ff5 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Caroline grew up abused by her brothers. Thus, the image of </div><div class="t m33d xf h2e y39c ff5 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Christ as her &quot;Brother&quot; hardly evokes a positive response. How </div><div class="t m33e xf h2e y39d ff5 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">do you present Christ to someone like her? </div><div class="t m17c x30 h30 y342 ff2 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">26 </div></div><div class="pi" data-data='{"ctm":[1.000000,0.000000,0.000000,1.000000,0.000000,0.000000]}'></div></div>
