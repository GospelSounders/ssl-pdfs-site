Previously, people </div><div class="t m467 xe h12 y16a ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;knew&quot; only what the ancient sources and authorities had told them, </div><div class="t m248 x68 h12 y16b ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">nothing more. Now, however, knowledge was based on science, on </div><div class="t m1b5 x68 h12 y16c ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">reason, on what you could study and learn from natural phenomenon. </div><div class="t m4ad x68 h12 y16d ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">For many, only what one could reason out and learn from nature and </div><div class="t m4ae xe h12 y16e ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">science was true; everything else was myth, or, at least, unknowable. </div><div class="t ma3 x7d h12 y9 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Fearful of the dangerous direction this attitude was taking Europe, </div><div class="t m310 x68 h12 y53d ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">French Huguenot Pierre Bayle tried to stem the tide by showing the limits </div><div class="t m4af x68 h12 y170 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of reason and by arguing that matters of faith extend beyond reason alone. </div><div class="t m4b0 x68 h12 y171 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">To buttress his point, he told the story of King David—a liar, an adulterer, </div><div class="t m4b1 x68 h12 y172 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">a murderer, a cheat—yet of whom the Lord said: &quot;I have found David the </div><div class="t m4b2 x68 h12 y53e ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">son of Jesse, a man after mine own heart&quot; (Acts 13:22). How could that be </div><div class="t m4b3 x68 h12 y174 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">true? Bayle asked. His answer was simple: It is true, because it deals with </div><div class="t m4b4 x68 h12 y175 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">something beyond human reason, and that is, God&apos;s grace. </div><div class="t m104 x7d h12 y176 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">However, within a century, Voltaire took Bayle&apos;s essay about David </div><div class="t m279 x68 h12 y53f ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and, without many changes in the text, turned it around and used it as </div><div class="t m1c0 x68 h12 y178 ff4 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">an attack </div><div class="t m4a x5f h12 y178 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">on faith itself. Here was King David, wrote Voltaire, a liar, an </div><div class="t m31a x68 h12 y179 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">adulterer, a murderer, a cheat, yet of whom the Lord said: &quot;I have found </div><div class="t m101 x68 h12 y17a ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">David the son of Jesse, a man after mine own heart&quot; (Acts 13:22). How </div><div class="t m5b x68 h12 y17b ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">could that be true? Voltaire asked. His answer was simple: It cannot be, </div><div class="t m4b5 x68 h12 y17c ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">because it is unreasonable and absurd. A man who kills, lies, cheats, </div><div class="t m31c x68 h12 y17d ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and murders cannot be someone after God&apos;s own heart. </div><div class="t m4b6 x2f h12 y17e ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">As Christians we would side, of course, with Bayle. Voltaire&apos;s atti-</div><div class="t m15d x68 h12 y17f ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tude, in contrast, shows how far beyond the reach of human reason </div><div class="t m1ee x68 h12 y540 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">alone God&apos;s grace is, especially to the unconverted. The greatest event </div><div class="t m4b7 x78 h12 y181 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in all human history, the death of Jesus on the cross, is an event that </div><div class="t m2d7 x68 h12 y182 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">goes way beyond human reason alone. No wonder Paul talked about </div><div class="t m105 x68 h12 y183 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the &quot;mystery of the gospel&quot; (Eph. 6:19). Nothing is more of a mystery </div><div class="t m339 x68 h12 y184 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">than how God can accept sinners; such as liars, adulterers, murderers, </div><div class="t m4b8 x68 h12 y185 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and cheaters like David or even like ourselves. </div><div class="t m4b9 x48 h11 y186 ff3 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Read carefully the following few verses: Isa. 55:8, 9; </div><div class="t m3f9 x7 h11 y541 ff3 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">1 Cor. 1:20-27; 2 Cor. 5:19; Eph. 1:6-9; and Phil. 2:5-8.
