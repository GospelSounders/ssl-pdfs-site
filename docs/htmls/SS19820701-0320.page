In Him God has recon-</div><div class="t m2f1 x75 h15 y2fd ff4 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ciled the world unto Himself. The kingdom has come!

To that end has Christ sent us into the world. (2) The </div><div class="t m2f4 x75 h15 y2ff ff4 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">message of the New Testament is that, with the first coming of Christ, </div><div class="t m2f5 x75 h15 y300 ff4 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the kingdom of God has become a reality on earth. (See Matt. 4:17; </div><div class="t m2f6 x75 h15 y301 ff4 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">12:28.) This kingdom, however, does not consist of words, but of </div><div class="t m2f7 x75 h15 y302 ff4 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">deeds. (See Luke 6:46-49.) It is a lived reality, embodied in flesh and </div><div class="t m2f8 x75 h15 y303 ff4 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">blood, in conduct, and in relations between people. (See verse 21.) </div><div class="t m2f9 x75 h15 y304 ff4 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">(3) Christ came into this world to bring healing to the sick, to set at </div><div class="t m2fa x75 h15 y305 ff4 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">liberty those who are oppressed, to feed the hungry, to help the poor, to </div><div class="t m2fb x75 h15 y306 ff4 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">strengthen those who are weak.

(4) Jesus came into this world to unmask the devil and to show the </div><div class="t m2fe x75 h15 y30c ff4 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">true nature of evil and sin (1 John 3:8). Said Jesus Himself: &quot;I saw Satan </div><div class="t m2ff x75 h15 y30d ff4 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">fall like lightning from heaven&quot; (Luke 10:18, RSV).
