During my free time I </div><div class="t m4c x35 h9 y53a ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">enjoyed going to game parlors, where I could watch TV, play </div><div class="t m2f xc7 h9 y53a ff7 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">mah </div><div class="t m561 xc h9 y53b ff7 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">long </div><div class="t m562 x6d h9 y53b ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">or poker, and listen to music. At first I enjoyed the music and </div><div class="t m8f x35 h9 y53c ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">relaxed with the rhythm. But gradually the music and atmosphere </div><div class="t m49a x35 h9 y53d ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of these places began to depress me. It seemed that a voice told me, </div><div class="t m563 x35 h9 y53e ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Leave this place and never return!&quot; </div><div class="t m2e x74 h9 y53f ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I studied electronics and opened a home appliance repair shop. </div><div class="t m3cd x35 h9 y540 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">But I still played poker with my friends. I did not realize it, but I </div><div class="t m409 x35 h9 y541 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was addicted to gambling. I struggled with jealousy and hatred too. </div><div class="t mdf x35 h9 y542 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">And once, because of my gambling habit, I was even jailed. When I </div><div class="t m1fc x35 h9 y543 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">got out of jail, my old friends laughed at me. But they still wanted </div><div class="t m4c x35 h9 y544 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">me to gamble with them. </div><div class="t m4af x74 h9 y98 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I began to think seriously about life and realized how many </div><div class="t m2a6 x35 h9 y545 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">people in modern China are seeking after money. More and more </div><div class="t m564 x35 h9 y546 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">people have become self-centered and jealous. Principles of truth </div><div class="t m565 x35 h9 y547 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and right living have become blurred in people&apos;s minds as they </div><div class="t m4a x3b h9 y548 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">have become slaves to money! </div><div class="t m566 x74 h9 y549 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I knew what was right and wrong, and I decided to listen to my </div><div class="t m46d x3b h9 y54a ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">conscience and follow its leading. But my good intentions left me </div><div class="t m477 x3b h9 y54b ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">friendless and lonely. Then I remembered a gospel radio program I </div><div class="t m2f8 x3b h9 y54c ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">had heard on shortwave radio. </div><div class="t m567 x74 h9 y54d ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I found the program on the dial and began listening. Hope </div><div class="t m1a0 x3b h9 y54e ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">returned to my heart. Since October [1996] I have been listening to </div><div class="t m68 x3b h9 y54f ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the Voice of Hope radio from Hong Kong. </div><div class="t m171 x20 h9 y550 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Ever since I began listening to these Christian programs my </div><div class="t m2ec x3b h9 y551 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">spiritual life has taken shape and is growing. I am thrilled about the </div><div class="t m2c9 x3b h9 y552 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">privilege of knowing the Lord. Now I have hope and meaning in </div><div class="t m568 x3b h9 y553 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">my life. I would like to give thanks to Jesus first, but also to the </div><div class="t m569 x3b h9 y554 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">radio speakers and all of you who have made those wonderful </div><div class="t m462 x3b h9 y555 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">programs that proclaim the good news. </div><div class="t mdf x20 h9 y556 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I believe in God; I am seeking truth; I am thirsty for truth. I want </div><div class="t m56a x3b h9 y557 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to be baptized and cleansed by the Holy Spirit so that I can grow </div><div class="t m249 x3b h9 y558 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">strong in the Lord. With God&apos;s mighty power I believe I can be a </div><div class="t m56b x3b h9 y559 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">strength to others in chasing away evil. I yearn to help people to </div><div class="t m1bf x37 h9 y55a ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">walk in the path that leads to life eternal. </div><div class="t m56c x20 h21 y55b ff6 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Zeng Qing Peng lives in China.
