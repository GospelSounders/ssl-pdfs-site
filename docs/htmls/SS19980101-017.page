It is important in that it is one of the earliest Christian </div><div class="t md5 x4e hd yd8 ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">documents that we possess. And it provides one of the most detailed </div><div class="t md6 x4e hd yd9 ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">accounts of early Christian congregations. Probably written before </div><div class="t md7 x4e hd yda ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the first of the Gospels, 1 Corinthians gives us access to the ground </div><div class="t md8 x4e hd ydb ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">floor of Christianity. We see Christianity as it grows, thrives, and </div><div class="t md9 x4e hd ydc ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">spreads. We see the gospel making inroads into one of the great cities </div><div class="t mda x4e hd ydd ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of the ancient world. In 1 Corinthians, Paul tries to equip early </div><div class="t mdb x4e hd yde ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Christian disciples to live the gospel in the sophisticated culture of </div><div class="t mdc x4e hd ydf ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Corinth. He longs for his correspondents to establish a firm self-</div><div class="t mdd x4e hd ye0 ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">identity as Christians, one that will stand the onslaught of social </div><div class="t mde x4e hd ye1 ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">pressure. </div><div class="t mdf x4f hd ye2 ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">First Corinthians may come as something of a surprise. In writing </div><div class="t me0 x4e hd ye3 ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the letter, Paul does not sit down and compose a detached theological </div><div class="t me1 x4 hd ye4 ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">essay. Instead, it is the work of a busy pastor-evangelist who ad-</div><div class="t me2 x4e hd ye5 ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">dresses real issues confronting Christians at Corinth. What may </div><div class="t me3 x4e hd ye6 ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">surprise us is that they faced so many problems, felt the pull of so </div><div class="t me4 x4 hd ye7 ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">many temptations, and experienced such deep division among them-</div><div class="t me5 x4 hd ye8 ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">selves. </div><div class="t me6 x4f hd ye9 ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">This significant document, with its surprising and realistic portrait </div><div class="t mdb x4 hd yea ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of Christianity in the apostolic age, has much to say to us. Modern </div><div class="t me7 x4 hd yeb ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">cultures are increasingly urban ones. If the gospel of Jesus Christ is </div><div class="t me8 x4 hd yec ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to advance today, it must walk the streets of modern cities and find a </div><div class="t me9 x4 hd yed ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">place in the hearts of the citizens of our world&apos;s great metroplexes. </div><div class="t mea x4 hd yee ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">And many of the themes treated by Paul are ones that are of real </div><div class="t meb x4 hd yef ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">interest to Christians of our era. We still experience fractured fellow-</div><div class="t mec x4 hd yf0 ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ship and sometimes face one another in courtrooms. How to with-</div><div class="t med x4 hd yf1 ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">stand the lure of sexual temptation remains a topic of importance. </div><div class="t mee x41 hd yf2 ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">We wrestle with what it means to live in view of Christ&apos;s return, the </div><div class="t m6e x4 hd y77 ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">appropriate function of spiritual gifts, and how to conduct public </div><div class="t m9d x41 hd yf3 ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">worship. </div><div class="t mde x3 hd yf4 ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">However, not every issue that Paul raises is a burning one for us. </div><div class="t mef x41 hd yf5 ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">We may not find immediately applicable Paul&apos;s counsel on circum-</div><div class="t mf0 x41 hd yf6 ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">cision, head coverings, or food offered to idols.

He drags the mundane and everyday </div><div class="t mf3 x41 hd yf9 ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">into the realm of the profound and the eternal. Even when the theme </div><div class="t mf4 x41 hd yfa ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">seems peripheral to modern discipleship, Paul&apos;s reflections will prove </div><div class="t mf5 x50 hd yfb ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">inspirational. </div><div class="t mf6 x3 hd yfc ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">We may take up the study of 1 Corinthians, then, with the hope </div><div class="t mf7 x41 hd yfd ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and prayer that the God who inspired Paul to compose it will be </div><div class="t mf8 x50 hd yfe ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">present with us as we reflect on these ancient words. </div><div class="t mf9 x3d hd y64 ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">5 </div></div><div class="pi" data-data='{"ctm":[1.000000,0.000000,0.000000,1.000000,0.000000,0.000000]}'></div></div>
