It is important in that it is one of the earliest Christian </div><div class="t md5 x4d hb yd7 ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">documents that we possess. And it provides one of the most detailed </div><div class="t md6 x4d hb yd8 ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">accounts of early Christian congregations. Probably written before </div><div class="t md7 x4d hb yd9 ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the first of the Gospels, 1 Corinthians gives us access to the ground </div><div class="t md8 x4d hb yda ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">floor of Christianity. We see Christianity as it grows, thrives, and </div><div class="t md9 x4d hb ydb ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">spreads. We see the gospel making inroads into one of the great cities </div><div class="t mda x4d hb ydc ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of the ancient world. In 1 Corinthians, Paul tries to equip early </div><div class="t mdb x4d hb ydd ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Christian disciples to live the gospel in the sophisticated culture of </div><div class="t mdc x4d hb yde ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Corinth. He longs for his correspondents to establish a firm self-</div><div class="t mdd x4d hb ydf ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">identity as Christians, one that will stand the onslaught of social </div><div class="t mde x4d hb ye0 ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">pressure. </div><div class="t mdf x4e hb ye1 ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">First Corinthians may come as something of a surprise. In writing </div><div class="t me0 x4d hb ye2 ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the letter, Paul does not sit down and compose a detached theological </div><div class="t me1 x3 hb ye3 ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">essay. Instead, it is the work of a busy pastor-evangelist who ad-</div><div class="t me2 x4d hb ye4 ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">dresses real issues confronting Christians at Corinth. What may </div><div class="t me3 x4d hb ye5 ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">surprise us is that they faced so many problems, felt the pull of so </div><div class="t me4 x3 hb ye6 ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">many temptations, and experienced such deep division among them-</div><div class="t me5 x3 hb ye7 ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">selves. </div><div class="t me6 x4e hb ye8 ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">This significant document, with its surprising and realistic portrait </div><div class="t mdb x3 hb ye9 ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of Christianity in the apostolic age, has much to say to us. Modern </div><div class="t me7 x3 hb yea ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">cultures are increasingly urban ones. If the gospel of Jesus Christ is </div><div class="t me8 x3 hb yeb ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to advance today, it must walk the streets of modern cities and find a </div><div class="t me9 x3 hb yec ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">place in the hearts of the citizens of our world&apos;s great metroplexes. </div><div class="t mea x3 hb yed ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">And many of the themes treated by Paul are ones that are of real </div><div class="t meb x3 hb yee ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">interest to Christians of our era. We still experience fractured fellow-</div><div class="t mec x3 hb yef ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ship and sometimes face one another in courtrooms. How to with-</div><div class="t med x3 hb yf0 ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">stand the lure of sexual temptation remains a topic of importance. </div><div class="t mee x40 hb yf1 ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">We wrestle with what it means to live in view of Christ&apos;s return, the </div><div class="t m6e x3 hb y76 ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">appropriate function of spiritual gifts, and how to conduct public </div><div class="t m9d x40 hb yf2 ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">worship. </div><div class="t mde x2 hb yf3 ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">However, not every issue that Paul raises is a burning one for us. </div><div class="t mef x40 hb yf4 ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">We may not find immediately applicable Paul&apos;s counsel on circum-</div><div class="t mf0 x40 hb yf5 ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">cision, head coverings, or food offered to idols.

He drags the mundane and everyday </div><div class="t mf3 x40 hb yf8 ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">into the realm of the profound and the eternal.
