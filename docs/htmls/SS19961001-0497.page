They wanted information on the </div><div class="t m3d6 x28 h18 ya36 ff5 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">guerrilla organization I led. They didn&apos;t mince words.

Sometimes prisoners threatened me, and some-</div><div class="t m6ac xa3 h18 ya42 ff5 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">times I was afraid, but with the help of Adventist laymen, we led </div><div class="t m39b xa3 h18 ya43 ff5 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">many prisoners to spiritual freedom in Christ. We eventually started a </div><div class="t m4d0 xa3 h18 ya44 ff5 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">church, right inside the prison.
