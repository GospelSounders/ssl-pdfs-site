Natalia did not get along </div><div class="t m10 x29 h36 y5a8 ff4 fs1c fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">with her mother and did not visit her for eight years. But the pain of </div><div class="t m3ef x29 h36 y5a9 ff4 fs1c fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">separation made her miserable. </div><div class="t m276 x6f h36 y5aa ff4 fs1c fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Natalia&apos;s husband, Mikhail, had been raised as an atheist. He tried </div><div class="t m209 x29 h36 y5ab ff4 fs1c fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to live by his own wisdom, but he had no peace. He tried praying and </div><div class="t m93 x29 h36 y5ac ff4 fs1c fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">found that God answered his prayers, but when he visited the only </div><div class="t m25e x29 h36 y5ad ff4 fs1c fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Christian church he knew, he found only dead ceremonies. </div><div class="t m279 x6f h36 y5ae ff4 fs1c fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Then he met Natalia. She brought happiness to his life, but still </div><div class="t m4d5 x29 h36 y5af ff4 fs1c fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Mikhail felt a nagging emptiness inside. His father developed lung </div><div class="t m4d6 x29 h36 y5b0 ff4 fs1c fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">cancer, and the young couple cared for him until he died. But a woman </div><div class="t m4d7 x29 h36 y5b1 ff4 fs1c fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">who said she and Mikhail&apos;s father were married demanded the home </div><div class="t m34d xa h36 y5b2 ff4 fs1c fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Mikhail&apos;s father had left them. </div><div class="t m57 x9 h36 y5b3 ff4 fs1c fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Other problems came, and the young couple began arguing. It </div><div class="t m1b9 x29 h36 y5b4 ff4 fs1c fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">seemed that divorce was imminent. One day Mikhail overdosed on </div><div class="t m4d8 xa h36 y5b5 ff4 fs1c fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">drugs, hoping to die. Although he took enough drugs to kill an </div><div class="t m275 xa h36 y5b6 ff4 fs1c fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">elephant, he survived. Mikhail realized that God had spared his life. </div><div class="t m4d9 x9 h36 y5b7 ff4 fs1c fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Then Natalia learned that her mother had joined a dangerous </div><div class="t ma9 xa h36 y5b8 ff4 fs1c fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">religious sect. </div><div class="t mb0 x45 h36 y5b8 ff6 fs1c fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I have lost my mother forever! </div><div class="t m344 x2b h36 y5b9 ff4 fs1c fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">she thought.

As they talked, Natalia realized the wonderful changes in her </div><div class="t m350 xa h36 y5bd ff4 fs1c fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">mother.
