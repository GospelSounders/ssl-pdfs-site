Natalia did not get along </div><div class="t m10 x2a h3a y5a9 ff4 fs1c fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">with her mother and did not visit her for eight years. But the pain of </div><div class="t m3ef x2a h3a y5aa ff4 fs1c fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">separation made her miserable. </div><div class="t m276 x70 h3a y5ab ff4 fs1c fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Natalia&apos;s husband, Mikhail, had been raised as an atheist. He tried </div><div class="t m209 x2a h3a y5ac ff4 fs1c fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to live by his own wisdom, but he had no peace. He tried praying and </div><div class="t m93 x2a h3a y5ad ff4 fs1c fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">found that God answered his prayers, but when he visited the only </div><div class="t m25e x2a h3a y5ae ff4 fs1c fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Christian church he knew, he found only dead ceremonies. </div><div class="t m279 x70 h3a y5af ff4 fs1c fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Then he met Natalia. She brought happiness to his life, but still </div><div class="t m4d5 x2a h3a y5b0 ff4 fs1c fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Mikhail felt a nagging emptiness inside. His father developed lung </div><div class="t m4d6 x2a h3a y5b1 ff4 fs1c fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">cancer, and the young couple cared for him until he died. But a woman </div><div class="t m4d7 x2a h3a y5b2 ff4 fs1c fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">who said she and Mikhail&apos;s father were married demanded the home </div><div class="t m34d xb h3a y5b3 ff4 fs1c fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Mikhail&apos;s father had left them. </div><div class="t m57 xa h3a y5b4 ff4 fs1c fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Other problems came, and the young couple began arguing. It </div><div class="t m1b9 x2a h3a y5b5 ff4 fs1c fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">seemed that divorce was imminent. One day Mikhail overdosed on </div><div class="t m4d8 xb h3a y5b6 ff4 fs1c fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">drugs, hoping to die. Although he took enough drugs to kill an </div><div class="t m275 xb h3a y5b7 ff4 fs1c fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">elephant, he survived.

As they talked, Natalia realized the wonderful changes in her </div><div class="t m350 xb h3a y5be ff4 fs1c fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">mother.
