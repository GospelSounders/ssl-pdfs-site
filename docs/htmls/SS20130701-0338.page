The villagers </div><div class="t m0 x50 h4 y2dc ff3c fs2 fc0 sc0 ls2 ws1a">work hard every day. But on festival days, they put aside work and eat and </div><div class="t m0 x50 h4 y2dd ff3c fs2 fc0 sc0 ls2 ws65">drink and dance and laugh. But Zuri didn’t like the festivals. Often the men </div><div class="t m0 x50 h4 y2de ff3c fs2 fc0 sc0 ls2 ws8a">would get drunk and would fight. Often someone got hurt. Zuri told his father </div><div class="t m0 x50 h4 y2df ff3c fs2 fc0 sc0 ls2 ws1">how much he hated the noise and fighting and drinking during the festivals. </div><div class="t m0 xd h4 y2e0 ff3c fs2 fc0 sc0 ls2 ws1">“But what can we do?” his father asked. “We live here.”</div><div class="t m0 xd h4 y2e1 ff3c fs2 fc0 sc0 ls2 ws41">“We could go to the [Seventh-day] Adventist church on festival days,” Zuri </div><div class="t m0 x50 h4 y2e2 ff3c fs2 fc0 sc0 ls2 wsad">suggested. “They play games, and everyone has fun, but no one drinks or gets </div><div class="t m0 x50 h4 y2e3 ff3c fs2 fc0 sc0 ls2 ws1">hurt.

The next Sabbath Zuri went to </div><div class="t m0 x50 h4 y2ea ff3c fs2 fc0 sc0 ls2 ws6d">Sabbath School.

They </div><div class="t m0 x50 h4 y2ef ff3c fs2 fc0 sc0 ls2 ws1">were pleased to see how well church members treated Zuri. </div><div class="t m0 xd h4 y2f0 ff3c fs2 fc0 sc0 ls2 wsf2">One day the pastor announced a baptism. Zuri asked the pastor if he could </div><div class="t m0 x50 h4 y2f1 ff3c fs2 fc0 sc0 ls2 ws2d">be baptized. The pastor said that anyone who loves Jesus and wants to follow </div><div class="t m0 x50 h4 y2f2 ff3c fs2 fc0 sc0 ls2 wsf2">Him can be baptized. Zuri ran home and told his parents what the pastor had </div><div class="t m0 x50 h4 y2f3 ff3c fs2 fc0 sc0 ls2 ws1">said.
