God sees the </div><div class="t m28f x97 h15 y869 ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">end from the beginning: Why should He convene a court session in heaven </div><div class="t m211 x97 h15 y86a ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to decide who should be saved and who lost? </div><div class="t m17f x8 h15 y86b ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">God is not concerned only with His own attitudes and reactions.

The heavenly judgment now in session is an on-going scrutiny of </div><div class="t mdb x97 h15 y402 ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">people&apos;s lives, so that the universe can know who is growing in Christ- and </div><div class="t m4b7 x97 h15 y1a5 ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">who is refusing to grow. Our Lord promises to give us unlimited power to </div><div class="t mb2 x97 h15 y1a6 ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">serve Him and overcome all evil. The pre-advent judgment decides who is </div><div class="t m118 x97 h15 y1a7 ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">availing himself of that power, -and who is not. </div><div class="t m564 x2d h15 y1a9 ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The pre-advent judgment is intended by God to be a great incentive for </div><div class="t m126 x97 h15 yd6 ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">last-day people to turn to Christ and receive His Spirit into their hearts.

(See Ex. </div><div class="t m30c x97 h15 y84e ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">25:8.) This sanctuary was not the same as a modern church.
