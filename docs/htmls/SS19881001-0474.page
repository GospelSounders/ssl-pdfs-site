God sees the </div><div class="t m28f x96 h12 y868 ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">end from the beginning: Why should He convene a court session in heaven </div><div class="t m211 x96 h12 y869 ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to decide who should be saved and who lost? </div><div class="t m17f x7 h12 y86a ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">God is not concerned only with His own attitudes and reactions. He is </div><div class="t m3db x96 h12 y43c ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">concerned that all the inhabitants of the unfallen&apos;universe should be thor-</div><div class="t m4dd x96 h12 y86b ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">oughly convinced that the people He takes to heaven at the second coming of </div><div class="t m90 x96 h12 y86c ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Jesus have a right to be there.

He cannot take to heaven people who refuse to receive the </div><div class="t m6f x96 h12 y4c3 ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Holy Spirit as the power to overcome sin. There is a special sealing work to </div><div class="t m3b7 x96 h12 y6d0 ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">be done before our Lord returns. Associated with that work there will be a </div><div class="t m194 x96 h12 y870 ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">mighty outpouring of the Holy Spirit (the &quot;latter rain&quot;) as the end draws </div><div class="t m144 x96 h12 y871 ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">near. The heavenly judgment now in session is an on-going scrutiny of </div><div class="t mdb x96 h12 y401 ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">people&apos;s lives, so that the universe can know who is growing in Christ- and </div><div class="t m4b7 x96 h12 y1a4 ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">who is refusing to grow. Our Lord promises to give us unlimited power to </div><div class="t mb2 x96 h12 y1a5 ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">serve Him and overcome all evil. The pre-advent judgment decides who is </div><div class="t m118 x96 h12 y1a6 ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">availing himself of that power, -and who is not. </div><div class="t m564 x2c h12 y1a8 ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The pre-advent judgment is intended by God to be a great incentive for </div><div class="t m126 x96 h12 yd5 ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">last-day people to turn to Christ and receive His Spirit into their hearts. Their-</div><div class="t m3cc x96 h12 y1a9 ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">innocence in Christ will make it possible for the heavenly court to decide </div><div class="t m43b x96 h12 y38b ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that their names should be kept in the book of life for eternity. </div><div class="t m2a7 x96 h12 y240 ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I.

(See Ex. </div><div class="t m30c x96 h12 y84d ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">25:8.) This sanctuary was not the same as a modern church. It consisted of a </div><div class="t m90 x96 h12 y245 ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">courtyard in which was a tent or tabernacle. The tent contained two rooms, </div><div class="t m402 x96 h12 y2d4 ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">one twice the size of the other. </div><div class="t m121 x2c h14 y40c ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Describe the two items of furniture in the court of the sanctuary.
