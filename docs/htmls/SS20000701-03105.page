We </div><div class="t m387 x5c h19 y554 ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">lived in treehouses for protection against enemies. </div><div class="t m427 x5d h19 y64 ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">When a logging company came to harvest timber, it established a </div><div class="t m608 xb h19 y556 ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">school for the loggers&apos; children. I learned of the school and begged my </div><div class="t m154 x5c h19 y66 ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">parents to let me enroll so I could learn to read. My parents permitted </div><div class="t m629 x5c h19 y7fe ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">me to study at the school until it closed two years later. </div><div class="t m73b x5d h19 y6dd ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">There was no other school in the region, but I had tasted the </div><div class="t m64c x5c h19 y55a ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sweetness of knowledge, and I wanted to learn more. So when I was 9 </div><div class="t md9 x5c h19 y7ff ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">years old I set out to find a school without telling my parents. I walked </div><div class="t m361 x5c h19 y6b ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">through the mountain forests, staying away from the trails where I </div><div class="t m2b1 x5c h19 y800 ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">might meet someone from an enemy tribe. At night I slept in trees. </div><div class="t m5f5 x5c h19 y6d ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Finally I arrived in Butuan City. I found a school and asked a teacher if </div><div class="t m243 x5c h19 y6e ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I could study there. When the teacher realized that I was a Manobo and </div><div class="t m1b4 x5c h19 y6f ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">how determined I was to attend school, she let me stay in her home and </div><div class="t m27c x5c h19 y801 ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">work to pay my tuition. </div><div class="t m3fd x6c h19 y561 ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">During high school I met a colporteur who introduced me to Jesus </div><div class="t m6d0 x5c h19 y562 ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Christ. I began selling literature to pay my school fees. I eventually </div><div class="t m225 x5c h19 y73 ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">completed a master&apos;s degree in public health. As the only Manobo in </div><div class="t m251 x5c h19 y1b ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the Philippines with an MPH, I could have any job I wanted, but I was </div><div class="t m1a5 x5a h19 y74 ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">determined to return to the mountains and teach my own people. </div><div class="t m10d x6c h19 y75 ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I arrived home and found my tribal land unoccupied. I knew that if </div><div class="t m1c2 x5a h19 y76 ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I did not claim the land, it would go to someone else. I built a simple </div><div class="t m9e x5a h19 y77 ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">school, and soon some 60 students enrolled. I needed help; I wrote to </div><div class="t m483 x5a h19 y23 ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Mountain View College and asked for a student missionary to come </div><div class="t m41 x5a h19 y564 ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and teach. </div><div class="t m1b3 x6c h19 y79 ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Jessica Hermoso volunteered. She made her way alone into the </div><div class="t m651 x5a h19 y565 ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">mountains and found the little mission school. She is a natural teacher, </div><div class="t m73c x5a h19 y28 ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and the children love her. But then rebel soldiers invaded the area, and </div><div class="t m2a x5a h19 y566 ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">it became too dangerous for Jessica or the students to remain. She </div><div class="t m3fd x5a h19 y567 ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">returned to her home, and I remained to farm my family&apos;s land. </div><div class="t m518 x6c h19 y568 ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">In 1997 I met Jessica again, and eventually we were married. When </div><div class="t m438 x71 h19 y569 ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">it was safe to return, we reopened the school. We have added a second </div><div class="t m226 x5a h19 y264 ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">school in a nearby village, and we are erecting more permanent </div><div class="t m32f x5a h19 y2a4 ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">buildings as funds become available. Other villages have asked us to </div><div class="t m73d x71 h19 y802 ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">teach their children, but we have no money to hire teachers. My dream </div><div class="t m305 x71 h19 y2a5 ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">for an education refused to die. In fact, it has grown far beyond what I </div><div class="t m564 x5a h19 y2a6 ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ever could have imagined. </div><div class="t m394 x6c h3b y803 ff3 fs23 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Danilo and Jessica Bada work with the Manobo people in the southern </div><div class="t m222 x71 h3b y804 ff3 fs23 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Philippines. </div><div class="t m137 x6c h19 y616 ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Produced by the General Conference Office of Mission Awarenes </div><div class="t m4aa x19 h19 y67e ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">E-mail: gomission(if,/c.adventistorg </div><div class="t m43c x9f h19 y706 ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">103 </div></div><div class="pi" data-data='{"ctm":[1.000000,0.000000,0.000000,1.000000,0.000000,0.000000]}'></div></div>
