In that month the </div><div class="t m3bb x25 h17 y444 ff2 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Passover, first and most important of the yearly festivals or sabbaths, would </div><div class="t m3bc x25 h17 y445 ff2 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">be commemorated every year. Not only was the Passover commemorative </div><div class="t m3bd x25 h17 y446 ff2 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">but it also was typical. It commemorated their miraculous deliverance from </div><div class="t m189 x25 h17 y447 ff2 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Egypt and pointed forward to the deliverance from sin that was to be brought </div><div class="t m7c x25 h17 y448 ff2 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">about by the Passover Lamb—Jesus Christ. </div><div class="t meb x65 h17 y21a ff2 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">After warning Pharaoh of the coming death of every firstborn, God gave </div><div class="t m3be x25 h17 y449 ff2 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Israel instructions on how they could avoid the disaster that was to fall on the </div><div class="t m2e4 x25 h17 y44a ff2 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Egyptians. These instructions not only were given for the first Passover ob-</div><div class="t m3bf x25 h17 y44b ff2 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">served in Egypt but also were given for a continuing memorial to be ob-</div><div class="t m7b x25 h17 y44c ff2 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">served throughout their history. (See Ex. 12:14-20; 13:1-16.) </div><div class="t m3c0 x65 h17 y44d ff2 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The time for their deliverance had come! Notice that their preparation </div><div class="t m36e x25 h17 y44e ff2 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">involved both spiritual and physical aspects. They were to prepare the Pass-</div><div class="t mff x25 h17 y44f ff2 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">over lamb and apply the blood to their doorposts. This symbolized spiritual </div><div class="t m3c1 x25 h17 y450 ff2 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">acceptance of God&apos;s salvation.

The revelation of the Lamb of God and His role in the plan of </div><div class="t m3a3 x7c h17 y253 ff2 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">salvation was progressive. However, they must have known that the service </div><div class="t m3c4 x7c h17 y254 ff2 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">had meaning beyond merely commemorating their escape from Egypt. The </div><div class="t m3c5 x7c h17 y255 ff2 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">symbol of the sacrificial lamb had been instituted in Eden along with the </div><div class="t m3c6 x7c h17 y456 ff2 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">promise of a &quot;seed&quot; that would bruise the serpent&apos;s head. The patriarchs </div><div class="t m3c7 x7c h17 y457 ff2 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">had continued to use the simple altar and to sacrifice lambs.
