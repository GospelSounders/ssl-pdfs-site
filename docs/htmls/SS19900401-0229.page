Romans 3:20-26 is often cited as evidence that God </div><div class="t m2f9 x23 h1d y447 ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">declares the sinner legally acquitted. The believer is &quot;justified freely by </div><div class="t m2fa x23 h1d y448 ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus&quot; (verse 24). Un-</div><div class="t m2fb x23 h1d y449 ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">doubtedly it means that the sins of the past are legally forgiven and </div><div class="t m50 x23 h1d y44a ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Christ&apos;s righteousness is counted for the sinner. (Compare Romans 4.) But </div><div class="t m12c x23 h1d y44b ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">notice that justification is said to be the gift of the righteousness of God </div><div class="t m2fc x23 h1d y4e ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">(verse 22). How does God give us His righteousness? Romans 8:9, 10 </div><div class="t m258 x23 h1d y44c ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">teaches that when we receive the Holy Spirit we receive Christ and His </div><div class="t m28a x23 h1d y3bd ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">righteousness. Only then are we not in the flesh but in the Spirit. Only then </div><div class="t m13e x23 h1d y47 ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">do we belong to Christ. Notice also that we &quot;are justified by his grace as </div><div class="t m1e5 x23 h1d y44d ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">a gift&quot; (Rom. 3:24, RSV). The gift of grace is not only a legal matter. It </div><div class="t m2fd x23 h1d y49 ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">involves a heart experience. Paul speaks of &quot;the surpassing grace of God </div><div class="t m2fe x23 h1d y53 ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in you&quot; (2 Cor. 9:14, RSV; compare verse 8; 1 Cor. 1:4, 5; 2 Peter 3:18). </div><div class="t mf2 x23 h1d y4b ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Hence, justification is both God&apos;s legal declaration of aquittal and a trans-</div><div class="t m2ff x23 h1d y4c ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">forming experience for the believer who receives the gift of the Holy </div><div class="t m78 x23 h1d y4d ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Spirit, the gift of divine grace. </div><div class="t m17d x9 h1d y44e ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Consider also Titus 3:5-7.

Not because of our works, but &quot;by </div><div class="t ma1 x2c h1d y450 ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the washing of regeneration.&quot; The Greek word translated &quot;regeneration&quot; </div><div class="t m300 x2c h1d y451 ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">means &quot;rebirth.&quot; (See the New International Version.) He saved us by the </div><div class="t m301 x2c h1d y5b ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">new birth experience, through the &quot;renewal by the Holy Spirit, whom he </div><div class="t mf6 x2c h1d y452 ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">poured out on us generously through Jesus Christ our Savior&quot; (verses 5, 6, </div><div class="t m274 x2c h1d y453 ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">NIV). This saving act was His justifying act. He saved us &quot;so that, having </div><div class="t m26c x2c h1d y454 ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">been justified [saved] by his grace, we might become heirs having the hope </div><div class="t m44 x2c h1d y455 ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of eternal life&quot; (verse 7, NIV). The saving was the justifying and the result </div><div class="t m233 x2c h1d y3c9 ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">is that we are heirs. Justification is salvation by the new birth experience. </div><div class="t m155 x2c h1d y456 ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The same Jesus who said to Nicodemus, &quot;Ye must be born again&quot; (John </div><div class="t m302 x2c h1d y457 ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">3:7) inspired the apostle Paul to explain salvation (justification) in the </div><div class="t m18b x2c h1d y458 ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">same terms. </div><div class="t mec x4c h1c y459 ff1 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Justification as a legal act of God. </div><div class="t m2bf x85 h1d y3cc ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;The law demands righteousness, </div><div class="t m303 x2c h1d y45a ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and this the sinner owes to the law; but he is incapable of rendering it.
