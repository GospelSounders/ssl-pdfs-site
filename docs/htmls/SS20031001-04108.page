Even the pagan mariners of chapter 1 recognize </div><div class="t m13c x46 h16 y623 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the power of the &quot;great storm&quot; involves more than just natural causes, </div><div class="t m312 x46 h16 y624 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and it draws their attention to the great God of heaven and earth. </div><div class="t m230 x47 h16 y671 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Without exception, all the Bible writers allow no serious point of </div><div class="t m331 x46 h16 y626 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">comparison between the true God and any false gods.

Then read Isaiah 40. In what </div><div class="t m184 x46 h27 y553 ff4 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ways do we see the Lord do some things in the book of Jonah that </div><div class="t m413 x46 h27 y97f ff4 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">are expressed about Him in Isaiah 40? </div><div class="t m144 x47 h16 y980 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Notice especially verses 26 and 28 in Isaiah 40, because they both </div><div class="t m21b x46 h16 y981 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">make references to the Lord&apos;s creative power.
