The man raced for his life, not daring to stop. Ahead, the </div><div class="t m2a0 x4e hb ya10 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">pathway dropped into the river. </div><div class="t m56b x55 hb ya11 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">With the tiger nearly upon him, the man leaped for a vine </div><div class="t m2d5 x1b hb ya12 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">hanging down from the trees overhead. He clung desperately to it </div><div class="t m324 x4e hb ya13 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">while the tiger paced back and forth below him. With his heart still </div><div class="t m2a4 x1b hb ya14 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">pounding, the man carefully inched down toward the river. </div><div class="t m516 x55 hb ya15 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Suddenly he stopped. What was that noise—a quiet swishing in </div><div class="t m31 x1b hb ya16 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the water below? He looked down, and to his horror he saw an </div><div class="t m22a x1b hb y4b ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">immense crocodile staring hungrily at him. Hand over hand he </div><div class="t m6a6 x1b hb ya17 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">pulled himself up the vine and away from the grasp of the crocodile&apos;s </div><div class="t m151 x4e hb ya18 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">jaws, only to see the tiger still watching him. Below, the croco-</div><div class="t m43a x1b hb ya19 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">dile; above, the tiger! </div><div class="t m572 x55 hb ya1a ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">His hands burned; he did not know how long he could hold on. </div><div class="t m589 x1b hb ya1b ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Would the tiger or the crocodile ever go away? He wrapped the </div><div class="t m30a x1b hb ya1c ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">vine around his waist and prepared to wait. Surely they would not </div><div class="t m1f5 x1b hb ya1d ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">stay forever. </div><div class="t m10d x55 hb ya1e ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">But in the quiet another sound struck horror in his heart. Two </div><div class="t m3b5 x1b hb y65d ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">rats, one black and one white, were gnawing on the vine above his </div><div class="t m551 x1b hb y57 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">head.

Now it was </div><div class="t m1e8 x1b hb ya1f ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">only a matter of time until he and the vine would crash into the </div><div class="t m521 x1b hb ya20 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">water below. </div><div class="t m46e x8c hb ya21 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">So ends this Khmer folk tale that illustrates the inevitability of </div><div class="t m26e x1b hb ya22 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">death.
