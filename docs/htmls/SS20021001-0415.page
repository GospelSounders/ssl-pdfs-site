H. Zachary </div><div class="t m210 x39 h24 y1ec ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Nazier was proud of his Muslim heritage. But in high school he </div><div class="t mdb x3e h24 y117 ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">discovered that his faith did not answer the deepest questions about life. </div><div class="t m211 x3e h24 y1ed ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">It did not help him handle the insecurity and emptiness he felt. Nazier </div><div class="t m212 x3e h24 y1ee ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">began looking into other religions. He studied some Eastern religions, </div><div class="t m213 x3e h24 y1ef ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">but something about their teachings did not ring true to him. </div><div class="t m136 x19 h24 y1f0 ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">After high school he entered a military academy. Then he found a </div><div class="t m6e x3e h24 y1f1 ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">small booklet on the life of Jesus. He was overwhelmed to realize that </div><div class="t m149 x3e h24 y49 ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Jesus loved him enough to die for him. Nazier accepted Jesus as his </div><div class="t m214 xc h24 y1f2 ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Friend and Savior. Then, when he realized that the military was not the </div><div class="t m215 xc h24 y1f3 ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">place for a follower of Jesus, he dropped out of military school. </div><div class="t m216 x19 h24 y1f4 ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Nazier bought a Bible and began to study it earnestly. He found </div><div class="t m1d7 xc h24 y122 ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">peace he never dreamed possible. He found a Protestant church in </div><div class="t m1a1 xc h24 y1f5 ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">which to worship, but for some reason he did not feel at home there. </div><div class="t m217 xc h24 y1f6 ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">However, he continued to worship there for several years. </div><div class="t mac x19 h24 y1f7 ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Then Moktier, one of his best friends in the Protestant church, told </div><div class="t m200 xc h24 y1f8 ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Nazier that he had become a Seventh-day Adventist. Nazier was </div><div class="t m218 xc h24 y1f9 ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">troubled, for he had heard that Adventists were a dangerous sect. </div><div class="t m219 xc h24 y1fa ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Finally the friends agreed to study the Bible together and follow </div><div class="t m21a xc h24 y1fb ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">whatever truths the Bible taught. </div><div class="t m21b x19 h24 y1fc ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Nazier was amazed that everything Moktier believed had a basis in </div><div class="t m21c xc h24 y1fd ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the Bible. Nazier had long felt that some teachings in the Protestant </div><div class="t m21d xc h24 y1fe ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">church had no basis in the Bible. Soon Nazier was sharing his newfound </div><div class="t m21e xc h24 y1ff ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Bible truths with others in the Protestant church. But he was disap-</div><div class="t m21f xc h24 y200 ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">pointed and hurt when they rejected the Bible&apos;s clear teachings in favor </div><div class="t m220 xc h24 ycf ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of their traditional teachings. </div><div class="t m221 x19 h24 y201 ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Nazier carefully checked every Adventist belief against what his </div><div class="t m222 x9 h24 y57 ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Bible taught, and soon he could not </div><div class="t m223 x9 h24 y202 ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">argue.
