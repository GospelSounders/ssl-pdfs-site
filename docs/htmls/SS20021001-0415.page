H. Zachary </div><div class="t m210 x38 h20 y1eb ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Nazier was proud of his Muslim heritage. But in high school he </div><div class="t mdb x3d h20 y116 ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">discovered that his faith did not answer the deepest questions about life. </div><div class="t m211 x3d h20 y1ec ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">It did not help him handle the insecurity and emptiness he felt. Nazier </div><div class="t m212 x3d h20 y1ed ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">began looking into other religions. He studied some Eastern religions, </div><div class="t m213 x3d h20 y1ee ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">but something about their teachings did not ring true to him. </div><div class="t m136 x18 h20 y1ef ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">After high school he entered a military academy. Then he found a </div><div class="t m6e x3d h20 y1f0 ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">small booklet on the life of Jesus. He was overwhelmed to realize that </div><div class="t m149 x3d h20 y48 ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Jesus loved him enough to die for him. Nazier accepted Jesus as his </div><div class="t m214 xb h20 y1f1 ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Friend and Savior. Then, when he realized that the military was not the </div><div class="t m215 xb h20 y1f2 ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">place for a follower of Jesus, he dropped out of military school. </div><div class="t m216 x18 h20 y1f3 ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Nazier bought a Bible and began to study it earnestly. He found </div><div class="t m1d7 xb h20 y121 ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">peace he never dreamed possible. He found a Protestant church in </div><div class="t m1a1 xb h20 y1f4 ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">which to worship, but for some reason he did not feel at home there. </div><div class="t m217 xb h20 y1f5 ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">However, he continued to worship there for several years. </div><div class="t mac x18 h20 y1f6 ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Then Moktier, one of his best friends in the Protestant church, told </div><div class="t m200 xb h20 y1f7 ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Nazier that he had become a Seventh-day Adventist. Nazier was </div><div class="t m218 xb h20 y1f8 ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">troubled, for he had heard that Adventists were a dangerous sect. </div><div class="t m219 xb h20 y1f9 ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Finally the friends agreed to study the Bible together and follow </div><div class="t m21a xb h20 y1fa ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">whatever truths the Bible taught. </div><div class="t m21b x18 h20 y1fb ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Nazier was amazed that everything Moktier believed had a basis in </div><div class="t m21c xb h20 y1fc ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the Bible. Nazier had long felt that some teachings in the Protestant </div><div class="t m21d xb h20 y1fd ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">church had no basis in the Bible. Soon Nazier was sharing his newfound </div><div class="t m21e xb h20 y1fe ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Bible truths with others in the Protestant church. But he was disap-</div><div class="t m21f xb h20 y1ff ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">pointed and hurt when they rejected the Bible&apos;s clear teachings in favor </div><div class="t m220 xb h20 yce ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of their traditional teachings. </div><div class="t m221 x18 h20 y200 ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Nazier carefully checked every Adventist belief against what his </div><div class="t m222 x8 h20 y56 ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Bible taught, and soon he could not </div><div class="t m223 x8 h20 y201 ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">argue.
