That forecast came from &quot;the apostles of </div><div class="t mb9 xb h1a y73d ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">our Lord Jesus Christ,&quot; and dealt with sensual skeptics who would deride </div><div class="t m732 xb h1a y821 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the thought of the second coming. The only such specific prophecy re-</div><div class="t m795 xb h1a yca ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">corded in the Bible is found in 2 Peter 3:3, 4.

If, as seems probable, Jude refers to Peter&apos;s </div><div class="t m3f6 x3c h1a yba2 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">prophecy, Peter&apos;s letter must have been written earlier. In that case, Jude, </div><div class="t m796 xb h1a yba3 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">consciously or otherwise, made use of that epistle when writing his </div><div class="t m2c3 x3c h1a y9b6 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">briefer but still powerful message.
