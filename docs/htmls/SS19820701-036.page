There is no one word in Hebrew that corresponds </div><div class="t ma8 x3e h15 yae ff4 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to our term &quot;world.&quot; But there are a large number of equivalents, such </div><div class="t mbd x3e h15 yaf ff4 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">as &quot;heaven and earth,&quot; the &quot;all,&quot; &quot;age&quot; (era), and the &quot;habitable </div><div class="t mbe x3e h15 yb0 ff4 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">earth.&quot; In Greek the words most frequently used for &quot;world&quot; </div><div class="t mbf x3f h15 yb0 ff8 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">(kosmos </div><div class="t mc0 x3e h15 y5b ff4 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and </div><div class="t mc1 x40 h15 y5b ff8 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">aion) </div><div class="t mc2 x21 h15 yb1 ff4 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">have at least six major meanings and many different shades of </div><div class="t mc3 x3e h15 yb2 ff4 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">meaning. Which meaning intended in the text can be determined only </div><div class="t mc4 x3e h15 yb3 ff4 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">by the context in which the word occurs. For instance, the apostle </div><div class="t m66 x3e h15 yb4 ff4 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">John urges us not to love the world, for, if anyone loves the world, love </div><div class="t mc5 x3e h15 yb5 ff4 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">for the Father is not in him. (See 1 John 2:15-17). Yet, is not the very </div><div class="t m8e x3e h15 yb6 ff4 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">heart of the gospel the assurance that God loves this world? (See John </div><div class="t mc6 x3e h15 yb7 ff4 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">3:16, 17.) In 1 Corinthians 1:20-31 and 3:19 the apostle Paul mentions </div><div class="t mc7 x3e h15 yb8 ff4 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that the wisdom of this world is foolishness in the eyes of God. Yet, </div><div class="t mc8 x3e h15 yb9 ff4 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Jesus Himself, in Luke 16:8, commends the sons of this world for being </div><div class="t mc9 x3e h15 yba ff4 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">wiser in their generation than the sons of light. Scripture indicates that </div><div class="t mca x3e h15 ybb ff4 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">this world stands condemned in the eyes of God, and—because of </div><div class="t mcb x3e h15 ybc ff4 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Christ&apos;s work—has already been judged. (See John 5:24-30; 12:31.)
