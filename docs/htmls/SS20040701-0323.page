I could tell he was bur-</div><div class="t m1cc x26 h8 y2d6 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">dened down with a heavy weight of care. I felt impressed to speak to him </div><div class="t m2b6 x26 h8 y2d7 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and prayed that God would tell me what to say. On the bus ride across </div><div class="t m2b7 x26 h8 y2d8 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the city we talked, oblivious to the cold inside the bus or the snow </div><div class="t m2b8 x26 h8 y2d9 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">swirling around outside. Little by little I saw a glimmer of hope in </div><div class="t m2b9 x26 h8 y2da ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Stefan&apos;s eyes. </div><div class="t m97 x49 h8 y2db ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">We talked about God&apos;s love for the sinner and about Jesus Christ, the </div><div class="t m2ba x26 h8 y2dc ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Savior. I could see hope begin to light his eyes. As we approached my stop, </div><div class="t m1f0 x26 h8 y2dd ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I gave him the address of the church in the town where I lived and told him </div><div class="t m2bb x26 h8 y2de ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">when services were held. Then we parted. </div><div class="t m2bc x49 h8 y2df ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Two weeks later on Saturday evening, Stefan came to the church for </div><div class="t m21d x26 h8 y2e0 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">vespers. He had brought a chess game with him, in hopes of playing a </div><div class="t m2bd x26 h8 y2e1 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">game of chess with me. At the end of the service I greeted him warmly and </div><div class="t m2be x26 h8 y9e ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">introduced him to several men in the church whom I had asked to pray for </div><div class="t m2bf x84 h8 y2e2 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Stefan. He told me that after we had talked that night on the bus he had </div><div class="t m40 x84 h8 y2e3 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">decided to find the courage to continue living rather than commit suicide. </div><div class="t m25b x84 h8 y2e4 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I asked Stefan if he could share with me what had happened in the past </div><div class="t m171 x84 h8 y2e5 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">two weeks. He agreed, so we went outside into the cold and talked for two </div><div class="t m16f x84 h8 y2e6 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">hours. </div><div class="t m2c0 x49 h8 y2e7 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">He told me that he had learned that his wife was having an affair.

I asked him if I could pray for him before he left, and he agreed. </div><div class="t m272 x84 h8 y27c ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">We prayed, then I gave him my telephone number, and we parted. I did </div><div class="t m142 x84 h8 y2ea ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">not know if I would ever see Stefan again, but I prayed for him every </div><div class="t m2c3 x84 h8 y2eb ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">day. </div><div class="t m2c4 x4c h8 y2ec ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">A few months later my telephone rang. It was Stefan. He sounded so </div><div class="t m2c5 x84 h8 y2ed ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">happy, so well, that I hardly recognized him. He had located the Adventist </div><div class="t m2c6 x84 h8 y2ee ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">church in his city, and the members had welcomed him and loved him. He </div><div class="t m2c7 xf h8 y2ef ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">had found a job and was enjoying his work. He was studying the Bible and </div><div class="t m28b xf h8 y2f0 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">seemed sincerely eager to learn more about what God had in store for him. </div><div class="t m237 x4c h8 y2f1 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">And he told me of the surprise that had awaited him—he had learned </div><div class="t m8 xf h8 y2f2 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that his great-grandmother had been an Adventist. &quot;I have found myself1&quot; </div><div class="t m1e6 xf h8 y2f3 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">he exclaimed. &quot;I am saved!&quot; </div><div class="t m3b x4c h8 y2f4 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Later still, I learned that Stefan had been baptized into the Adventist </div><div class="t m2c8 xf h8 y2f5 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Church.
