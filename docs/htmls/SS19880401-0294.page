Barnabas, however, was </div><div class="t m139 x7 h15 y9ed ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">willing to overlook the weakness of young John Mark. He was willing to </div><div class="t ma8 x7 h15 y426 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">give him a second chance, and took him on a missionary trip to Cyprus (Acts </div><div class="t m342 x7 h15 y500 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">15:36-41). </div><div class="t m4fd x4d h15 y428 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Onesimus had made many serious mistakes.
