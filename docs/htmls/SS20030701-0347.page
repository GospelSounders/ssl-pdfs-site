His news stories have made his name well known to people. </div><div class="t m376 x41 hc y57e ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">He is also known as a deeply spiritual man who faithfully attends </div><div class="t m452 x41 hc y57f ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">prayers in the village mosque. The great burden of his life is for </div><div class="t m428 x41 hc y580 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">himself and his family to be ready for the great judgment day and </div><div class="t m2b6 x41 hc y581 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the return of Jesus. </div><div class="t m3a8 x46 hc y47 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">In his search for a closer walk with Allah, Abdul discovered </div><div class="t m11 x41 hc y582 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the counsel in the Qur&apos;an that he should study the messages of the </div><div class="t m453 x41 hc y583 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">prophets. He secured a copy of the Bible and began to study. He </div><div class="t m454 x41 hc y584 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was amazed to find many of the same stories of the spiritual </div><div class="t m1f2 x41 hc y585 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">leaders he knew from the Qur&apos;an. </div><div class="t m455 x46 hc y586 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">His heart was touched as he read the Gospels.

He was deeply impressed </div><div class="t m456 x41 hc y588 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">by the way Jesus helped the sick people. The teachings he discov-</div><div class="t m457 x41 hc y589 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ered in the parables also touched his heart. As the Holy Spirit </div><div class="t m175 x41 hc y58a ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">spoke to his heart Abdul was drawn to Jesus. </div><div class="t m235 x46 hc y58b ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Then tragedy struck his family. His brother&apos;s wife became </div><div class="t m456 x41 hc y58c ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">seriously ill. She grew weaker until she lost consciousness. Abdul </div><div class="t m3 x41 hc y58d ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">spent hours with his brother during this time. When all hope </div><div class="t m348 x41 hc y58e ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">seemed lost for his sister-in-law the family gathered around her </div><div class="t m8a x41 hc y58f ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">bed and a sheet was placed over her body. </div><div class="t m458 x46 hc y590 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Abdul shared what he had experienced, &quot;With tears running </div><div class="t m459 x43 hc y591 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">down my face I fell on my knees beside the bed.
