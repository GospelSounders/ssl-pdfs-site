His news stories have made his name well known to people. </div><div class="t m376 x42 he y57f ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">He is also known as a deeply spiritual man who faithfully attends </div><div class="t m452 x42 he y580 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">prayers in the village mosque. The great burden of his life is for </div><div class="t m428 x42 he y581 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">himself and his family to be ready for the great judgment day and </div><div class="t m2b6 x42 he y582 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the return of Jesus. </div><div class="t m3a8 x47 he y48 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">In his search for a closer walk with Allah, Abdul discovered </div><div class="t m11 x42 he y583 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the counsel in the Qur&apos;an that he should study the messages of the </div><div class="t m453 x42 he y584 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">prophets. He secured a copy of the Bible and began to study. He </div><div class="t m454 x42 he y585 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was amazed to find many of the same stories of the spiritual </div><div class="t m1f2 x42 he y586 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">leaders he knew from the Qur&apos;an. </div><div class="t m455 x47 he y587 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">His heart was touched as he read the Gospels.

He was deeply impressed </div><div class="t m456 x42 he y589 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">by the way Jesus helped the sick people. The teachings he discov-</div><div class="t m457 x42 he y58a ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ered in the parables also touched his heart. As the Holy Spirit </div><div class="t m175 x42 he y58b ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">spoke to his heart Abdul was drawn to Jesus. </div><div class="t m235 x47 he y58c ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Then tragedy struck his family. His brother&apos;s wife became </div><div class="t m456 x42 he y58d ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">seriously ill. She grew weaker until she lost consciousness. Abdul </div><div class="t m3 x42 he y58e ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">spent hours with his brother during this time.
