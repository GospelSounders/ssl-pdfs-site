The nature of the claims cry out for us to </div><div class="t m2b5 x50 h6 y7c5 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tell them to others. Indeed, that&apos;s an essential component of who we </div><div class="t m4bf x50 h6 y778 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">are as Seventh-day Adventists. It&apos;s also why, through the grace of God, </div><div class="t m315 x50 h6 y91 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">we are in almost every country of the world. </div><div class="t m495 x12 h37 y4ff ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Read </div><div class="t m5ca x7c h5 y77b ff1 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0"> Revelation 14:6, 7, the first angel&apos;s message.

The better we seek to </div><div class="t m60c x50 h6 y7cd ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">meet those needs, the more we can reveal to the non-Christian world the </div><div class="t m4d3 x50 h6 y7ce ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">love and character of God, and the more effective our witness will be. </div><div class="t m51b x33 h37 y3db ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Look </div><div class="t m23e x7c h5 y29c ff1 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0"> at this quote from Ellen White: &quot;Christ&apos;s method alone will </div><div class="t m92 x50 h6 y3dc ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">give </div><div class="t m60d x7f h5 y3dc ff1 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">true success in reaching the people.
