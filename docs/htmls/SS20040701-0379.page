The nature of the claims cry out for us to </div><div class="t m2b5 x51 h8 y7c6 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tell them to others. Indeed, that&apos;s an essential component of who we </div><div class="t m4bf x51 h8 y779 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">are as Seventh-day Adventists. It&apos;s also why, through the grace of God, </div><div class="t m315 x51 h8 y92 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">we are in almost every country of the world. </div><div class="t m495 x13 h3b y500 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Read </div><div class="t m5ca x7d h7 y77c ff1 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0"> Revelation 14:6, 7, the first angel&apos;s message.
