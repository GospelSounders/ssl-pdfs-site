But this is a place where gates are not left ajar. </div><div class="t m329 x40 h24 ya4e ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I first visited this prison several years ago in response to a letter </div><div class="t m25e x44 h24 ya4f ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">asking for a visit by an Adventist. While I waited, the warden went </div><div class="t m4a1 x44 h24 ya50 ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">from cell to cell shouting, &quot;Church, church, church!&quot; Whoever wanted </div><div class="t m5c7 x44 h24 ya51 ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to attend was let out of his cell and herded into the courtyard. </div><div class="t m3c8 x40 h24 ya52 ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">A few months after I began holding worship services in this prison </div><div class="t m722 x44 h24 ya0e ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">chapel, three brothers joined our group. They were serving seven years </div><div class="t m41c x44 h24 ya53 ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">each for having killed someone out of revenge. Each of the men </div><div class="t m6a9 x44 h24 ya54 ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">became a spiritual pillar in the fledgling church. One made a fine song </div><div class="t m343 x46 h24 ya55 ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">leader; they all became leaders in the group. These men began distrib-</div><div class="t m78a x46 h24 ya56 ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">uting Voice of Prophecy enrollment cards, and with their help we </div><div class="t m379 x46 h24 ya57 ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">formed our first baptismal class. </div><div class="t m1f3 x40 h24 ya58 ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Soon eight prisoners were ready for baptism. But our request to </div><div class="t m5c7 x46 h24 ya59 ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">hold the baptism in the prison was turned down. After many requests, </div><div class="t m78b x44 h24 ya5a ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">we were at last granted permission. Then the day before the baptism, </div><div class="t m451 x44 h24 ya5b ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">we learned that the warden had changed his mind; the baptism could </div><div class="t m284 x46 h24 ya5c ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">not be held. </div><div class="t m90 x83 h24 y654 ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Discouraged, I asked a colleague for advice. He suggested we &quot;pray </div><div class="t m264 x46 h24 ya5d ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">a lot and play it low.&quot; We placed the baptism in God&apos;s hands, trusting </div><div class="t m78c x46 h24 ya5e ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Him to open the gates. On Sabbath morning we approached the prison </div><div class="t m435 x46 h24 ya5f ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">with several union and local church officers. After lengthy negotia-</div><div class="t m3a6 x46 h24 ya60 ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tions, the ministers were allowed into the prison to officiate in the </div><div class="t m356 x46 h24 ya61 ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">baptism. </div><div class="t m3c6 x83 h24 ya62 ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">As the baptismal candidates stood to take their vows, I realized that </div><div class="t m70 x46 h24 ya63 ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the Lord had indeed touched these lives and opened the gates to a new </div><div class="t m78d x72 h24 ya64 ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">life. That day six souls were added to </div><div class="t m11f x72 h24 ya65 ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the church of God. The three brothers </div><div class="t m43 x72 h24 ya66 ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">were released from prison.

The third brother, </div><div class="t m42 xa2 h24 ya68 ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Hastings, returned to prison, not as a </div><div class="t m104 xa2 h24 ya69 ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">prisoner but as a spiritual worker. </div><div class="t m78f xc4 h53 ya6a ff6 fs1c fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Birthie Tyers is a layman living </div><div class="t m790 x7b h24 ya6b ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in </div><div class="t m791 xa2 h53 ya6c ff6 fs1c fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Windhoek, Namibia.
