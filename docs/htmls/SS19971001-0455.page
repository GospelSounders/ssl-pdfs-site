Konde told </div><div class="t m9f x46 h21 y565 ff3 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">his brother about the book, and the two began reading it together. </div><div class="t m340 x46 h21 y566 ff3 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">They compared it with the Bible and found it to be true. They </div><div class="t m4c0 x46 h21 y567 ff3 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">learned that the Sabbath of the Bible was Saturday. They found </div><div class="t m4c1 x46 h21 y568 ff3 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the Adventist church and eventually were baptized.
