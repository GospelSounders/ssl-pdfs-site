Ps. 33:6. </div><div class="t m2f6 x54 h20 y859 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">What does this tell us about Him? </div><div class="t m240 x1a h1d y85a ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The truth stated in Psalm 33:6 is one of the most simple and yet </div><div class="t m326 x54 h1d y3bf ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">profound statements about God and His power in the Scriptures. We </div><div class="t m32b x54 h1d y382 ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">see this divine process in operation, without explanation, in Genesis, </div><div class="t maf x54 h1d y3f2 ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">chapter 1. Each of the first days is introduced by the expression &quot;And </div><div class="t m64f x54 h1d y85b ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">God said . . .&quot; </div><div class="t m1ce x1b h20 y3f4 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">What material did God use when He </div><div class="t m41d xca h1d y3f4 ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">created the universe, this </div><div class="t m6a2 x54 h20 y11d ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">world, humankind? Heb. 11:3. </div><div class="t m6a3 x1b h1d y7a ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The account of the creation of the first humans in Genesis 2:7, 20-22 </div><div class="t m156 x13 h1d y723 ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">clearly depicts God making Adam from clay; Eve, in turn, was created </div><div class="t m227 x13 h1d y724 ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">from Adam&apos;s rib. In these cases, God did use matter that was already </div><div class="t m64a x13 h1d y11e ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in existence. However, the question remains: Where did that matter, </div><div class="t m591 x13 h1d y11f ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the clay, for example, ultimately come from? According to Hebrews </div><div class="t m402 x13 h1d y120 ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">11:3, we understand by faith &quot;that the universe was formed at God&apos;s </div><div class="t m6a4 x13 h1d y88c ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">command, so that what is seen was not made out of what was </div><div class="t m2b0 x13 h1d y122 ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">visible&quot;(NIV). This was the best way that the author of Hebrews could </div><div class="t m6a x13 h1d y81 ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">say that God made the universe out of nothing. Scholars describe this </div><div class="t m2c x13 h1d y82 ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">type of creation, of making something out of nothing by divine fiat (a </div><div class="t m12f x13 h1d y5d ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">command that creates something), as </div><div class="t m15e x2d h1d y125 ff7 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ex nihilo </div><div class="t m31a x8f h1d y125 ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">(&quot;out of nothing&quot;) </div><div class="t m326 x13 h1d y725 ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">creation. What the Bible is teaching here is that ultimately all matter </div><div class="t m2a0 x13 h1d y88d ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in the universe was created by God. Conversely, the Bible is saying </div><div class="t m5fb x13 h1d y726 ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that God preceded everything else in the universe, including matter </div><div class="t m318 x13 h1d y727 ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and energy, that He is eternal and the eternal Originator of everything. </div><div class="t m8f x24 h1d y728 ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">In this one simple statement the author of Hebrews staked out God&apos;s </div><div class="t m6a5 x13 h1d y98 ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">claim as the only true God of the universe. He has no rivals or peers, </div><div class="t m2f1 x13 h1d y72a ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">either animate or inanimate. Another way of making this point, which </div><div class="t m66d x13 h1d y7a4 ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was particularly significant in biblical times (but no less so today), is </div><div class="t m6a6 x13 h1d y88e ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that there are no other gods but the Lord (1 Chron. 16:24-27; Ps. 96:5, 6; </div><div class="t m6a7 x22 h1d y72c ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Isa. 40:18-26; 42:5-9; 44). </div><div class="t m6a8 x21 h20 y88f ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Think it through: God did not simply create this world or </div><div class="t m6b x73 h20 y890 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">wind it up like a clock and then abandon it. God is not an aloof </div><div class="t m25c x26 h20 y891 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">deity who has turned His back on His creation, leaving them to </div><div class="t m2f x26 h20 y892 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">their own devices. He continues &quot;upholding all things by the </div><div class="t m315 x73 h20 y15e ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">word of His power&quot; (Heb. 1:3, NKJV). Let us praise Him now </div><div class="t m4eb x73 h20 yf4 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">for every breath we take and every pulsation of the heart. </div><div class="t m1cb x77 h1d y7b4 ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">89 </div></div><div class="pi" data-data='{"ctm":[1.000000,0.000000,0.000000,1.000000,0.000000,0.000000]}'></div></div>
