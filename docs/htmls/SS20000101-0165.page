H. Zachary </div><div class="t m437 x5b hb y5ba ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Jardslaw Wajik, a popular rock band musician in Poland had </div><div class="t m5ab x81 hb y196 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">everything he wanted. Everything but peace. He had grown up attend-</div><div class="t m5e9 x81 hb y5bb ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ing church, but his life had become a tangled nightmare of tobacco, </div><div class="t m5ea x81 hb y7dd ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">drugs, alcohol, and sinful living. He knew that his lifestyle was killing </div><div class="t m5eb x81 hb y7de ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">him. Depression set in, and one night he sat on a street curb and cried. </div><div class="t m5ec x5b hb y7df ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">He was admitted to a mental hospital, and slowly his life began to </div><div class="t m5ed x81 hb y5bd ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">change. Following his release, he married a former Adventist woman </div><div class="t m3db x81 hb y7e0 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">who helped him recover his health. His music career soared, and his </div><div class="t m5ee x81 hb y5bf ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">records reached the top of the charts. In spite of success and financial </div><div class="t m562 x81 hb y5c0 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">security, Wajik still felt lonely. </div><div class="t m5ef x5b hb y5a2 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">When one of his band members announced that he intended to stop </div><div class="t m5f0 x81 hb y5c1 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">smoking, Wajik, who smoked 70 cigarettes a day, replied, &quot;If you are </div><div class="t m41d x81 hb y5c2 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">still clean in two weeks, I will stop smoking too.&quot; Two weeks later </div><div class="t m5f1 x81 hb y703 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Wajik knew he must keep that promise. He asked God to take away </div><div class="t m43 x81 hb y5c4 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">his hunger for liquor and tobacco. God came close to him and an-</div><div class="t m5f2 x81 hb y5c5 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">swered his prayer. </div><div class="t m4a0 x5b hb y5c6 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Then one day Wajik&apos;s wife announced that she had been rebap-</div><div class="t m5f3 x81 hb y7e1 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tized. She wanted a new life for herself and their daughter. Wajik did </div><div class="t m5eb x1 hb y7e2 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">not object. One day he picked up a Bible and, in his words, &quot;The Lord </div><div class="t m50 x81 hb y1c ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">opened it to Exodus 20.&quot; He read the Sabbath commandment and </div><div class="t m96 x1 hb y7e3 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">realized that the church of his childhood was not following all the </div><div class="t m46a x1 hb y7e4 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">commandments. He stopped performing in rock concerts on Sabbath. </div><div class="t m36f x61 hb y7e5 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">He attended Adventist evangelistic meetings but did not take a </div><div class="t m19d x1 hb y7e6 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">stand for God. Several months later at a youth camp meeting Wajik </div><div class="t m5f4 x1 hb y7e7 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">felt the Holy Spirit touch his heart. He gave his heart totally to God. At </div><div class="t m5f5 x1 hb y7e8 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">his baptism Wajik testified that &quot;My old life was buried in the water, </div><div class="t m1c4 x1 hb y7e9 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and Jesus has given me a new life. I am still a sinner, but I have a </div><div class="t m5f6 x1 hb y7ea ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">wonderful Friend, Jesus Christ.&quot; </div><div class="t m5f7 x61 hb y5cf ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">God impressed him that he needed to use his influence and popu-</div><div class="t m2ad x1 hb y4dc ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">larity to help others. He dropped out of his band and set his heart on </div><div class="t m3db x1 hb y7eb ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">three objectives. He wanted to have a relationship with God, a God-</div><div class="t m5f8 x1 hb y7ec ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">honoring family, and to be involved in some exemplary type of work. </div><div class="t m5f9 x1 hb y5d1 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">He had no idea how hard that would be. </div><div class="t m5fa x61 hb y6f7 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Wajik began writing songs for a new musical group. He wants to </div><div class="t m5fb x1 hb y7ed ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">show people the way out of sin, the way to joy and hope. He prays that </div><div class="t m5fc x1 hb y7ee ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the thousands who purchased his earlier albums will purchase the new </div><div class="t m5fd x1 hb y7ef ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">one and find in it the joy that Wajik has found in his new life in Christ. </div><div class="t m5fe x72 h2c y7f0 ff6 fs1c fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">J.
