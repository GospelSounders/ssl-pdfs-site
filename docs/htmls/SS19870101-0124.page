The scenario that followed showed the </div><div class="t m22b x5b h9 y34f ff3 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">powerlessness of the heathen gods and brought prominence to the true God. </div><div class="t m2b9 x56 h1d y350 ff1 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">3. A Hasty Decree (Dan. 2:12, 13). </div><div class="t m2ba x56 h9 y351 ff3 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">One question immediately arises: Where was Daniel at this time? How was it </div><div class="t m11e x5b h9 y352 ff3 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that he and his companions were not at the court with the rest of the learned elite? </div><div class="t m2bb x56 h9 y353 ff3 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">A number of suggestions have been made: </div><div class="t m2bc x2d h9 y3a ff3 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">1. </div><div class="t m14f x7c h9 y3a ff3 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">This situation arose before Daniel had graduated from his school. But the </div><div class="t m2bd x5b h9 y3b ff3 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">fact that Daniel was to be slain with the others, suggests that he was a full mem-</div><div class="t m2be x5b h9 y3e ff3 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ber of the group. </div><div class="t m91 x56 h9 y11d ff3 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">2. </div><div class="t m2bf x7c h9 y11d ff3 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Those responsible for issuing the kings&apos; summons purposely left Daniel </div><div class="t m245 x5b h9 y354 ff3 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and his companions out of the reckoning. The summons was not delivered be-</div><div class="t m131 x5b h9 y355 ff3 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">cause of the jealousy of the other counselors. They wanted to use the occasion </div><div class="t m6b x5b h9 yf1 ff3 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">for their own benefit. If this were their scheme and motive they certainly did not </div><div class="t m2c0 x5b h9 y356 ff3 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">deserve any mercy, certainly not from the &quot;captives.&quot; However, Daniel showed </div><div class="t m277 x5b h9 y357 ff3 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">an exemplary spirit by contrast, in that he was anxious to save the lives of his </div><div class="t m2c1 x5b h9 y83 ff3 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">fellow counselors. </div><div class="t m2c2 x56 h9 y358 ff3 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">3. </div><div class="t m2c3 x7c h9 y358 ff3 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Daniel and his companions may have been engaged in a regular prayer or </div><div class="t m2c4 x5b h9 y359 ff3 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">worship service that the Babylonians did not want to interrupt. </div><div class="t m2c5 x56 h9 y35a ff3 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Whatever may have been the reason, it is obvious that it was providential. In </div><div class="t m2c6 x5b h9 y35b ff3 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">this way the inability of the heathen counselors to accede to the king&apos;s request </div><div class="t m21c x5b h9 y2fa ff3 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was made more noticeable. </div><div class="t m2c7 x5b h34 y35c ff2 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">II. </div><div class="t m121 x9d h1d y35c ff1 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">THE INTERPRETATION. (Dan. 2:14-45). </div><div class="t m15d x56 h9 y35d ff3 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">In this case the interpretation became more acceptable and credible because of </div><div class="t m2c8 x5b h9 y35e ff3 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the miracle of discovery of what the dream had been. </div><div class="t m2c9 x56 h1d y35f ff1 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">1. A Wise Daniel (Dan. 2:14-16). </div><div class="t m2ca x53 h9 y360 ff3 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Daniel&apos;s tact was evident in the way he helped solve the question over the </div><div class="t m2cb x5d h9 y361 ff3 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Hebrew youths&apos; diet.

The NIV translates it as &quot;harsh.&quot; It does </div><div class="t m2d1 x5d h9 yd4 ff3 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">not suggest criticism, although it does imply surprise. Recognizing that it was a </div><div class="t m177 x5d h9 y9c ff3 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">reasonable question, Arioch gave Daniel the details of what happened that day </div><div class="t m27f x5d h9 y26c ff3 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">(verse 15). </div><div class="t m2d2 x56 h9 y18c ff3 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Apparently Daniel asked for an interview with the king and it was granted. </div><div class="t m191 x5d h9 y369 ff3 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Nebuchadnezzar, knowing that he could not get an answer from the Babylonian </div><div class="t m2d3 x5d h9 y36a ff3 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">elite, probably was willing to try any source. Daniel assured him that it was </div><div class="t m2d4 x5d h9 ya0 ff3 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">possible to find help, but he would need time to do so. Daniel then shared his </div><div class="t m1c8 x5d h9 y36b ff3 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">problem with his companions. It always helps to seek counsel from those of like </div><div class="t m2d5 x5d h9 y36c ff3 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">faith.
