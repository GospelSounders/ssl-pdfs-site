The scenario that followed showed the </div><div class="t m22b x5a hb y350 ff3 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">powerlessness of the heathen gods and brought prominence to the true God. </div><div class="t m2b9 x55 h1f y351 ff1 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">3. A Hasty Decree (Dan. 2:12, 13). </div><div class="t m2ba x55 hb y352 ff3 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">One question immediately arises: Where was Daniel at this time? How was it </div><div class="t m11e x5a hb y353 ff3 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that he and his companions were not at the court with the rest of the learned elite? </div><div class="t m2bb x55 hb y354 ff3 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">A number of suggestions have been made: </div><div class="t m2bc x2e hb y3b ff3 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">1. </div><div class="t m14f x7b hb y3b ff3 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">This situation arose before Daniel had graduated from his school.

The summons was not delivered be-</div><div class="t m131 x5a hb y356 ff3 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">cause of the jealousy of the other counselors. They wanted to use the occasion </div><div class="t m6b x5a hb yf2 ff3 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">for their own benefit. If this were their scheme and motive they certainly did not </div><div class="t m2c0 x5a hb y357 ff3 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">deserve any mercy, certainly not from the &quot;captives.&quot; However, Daniel showed </div><div class="t m277 x5a hb y358 ff3 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">an exemplary spirit by contrast, in that he was anxious to save the lives of his </div><div class="t m2c1 x5a hb y84 ff3 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">fellow counselors. </div><div class="t m2c2 x55 hb y359 ff3 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">3. </div><div class="t m2c3 x7b hb y359 ff3 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Daniel and his companions may have been engaged in a regular prayer or </div><div class="t m2c4 x5a hb y35a ff3 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">worship service that the Babylonians did not want to interrupt. </div><div class="t m2c5 x55 hb y35b ff3 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Whatever may have been the reason, it is obvious that it was providential. In </div><div class="t m2c6 x5a hb y35c ff3 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">this way the inability of the heathen counselors to accede to the king&apos;s request </div><div class="t m21c x5a hb y2fb ff3 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was made more noticeable. </div><div class="t m2c7 x5a h38 y35d ff2 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">II. </div><div class="t m121 x9c h1f y35d ff1 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">THE INTERPRETATION. (Dan. 2:14-45). </div><div class="t m15d x55 hb y35e ff3 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">In this case the interpretation became more acceptable and credible because of </div><div class="t m2c8 x5a hb y35f ff3 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the miracle of discovery of what the dream had been. </div><div class="t m2c9 x55 h1f y360 ff1 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">1.

Daniel assured him that it was </div><div class="t m2d4 x5c hb ya1 ff3 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">possible to find help, but he would need time to do so. Daniel then shared his </div><div class="t m1c8 x5c hb y36c ff3 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">problem with his companions. It always helps to seek counsel from those of like </div><div class="t m2d5 x5c hb y36d ff3 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">faith.
