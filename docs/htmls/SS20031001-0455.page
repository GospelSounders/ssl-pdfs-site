She grew </div><div class="t m4d8 x6f hf y42 ff2 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">up on a sheep station in northern Australia. The family moved </div><div class="t m49a x6f hf y594 ff2 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">from one station to another as work demanded. </div><div class="t m2de x20 hf y595 ff2 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">As a teen Linda started drinking and smoking with her friends; </div><div class="t m25a x6f hf y596 ff2 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">after she married, she drank with her husband. The couple worked </div><div class="t m4d9 x6f hf y597 ff2 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">for a time at an Adventist mission, and the couple put away their </div><div class="t m4da x6f hf y598 ff2 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">destructive habits. Then Linda&apos;s husband was offered a job some </div><div class="t m331 x6f hf y49 ff2 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">distance from the mission. The promised job did not work out, and </div><div class="t m25f x6f hf y599 ff2 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Linda&apos;s husband started drinking again. The couple began fight-</div><div class="t m3d x1d hf y59a ff2 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ing. Life became so bad that Linda finally left her husband. </div><div class="t m31d x10 hf y59b ff2 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">She wandered from place to place. She lost her faith, her self-</div><div class="t m4db x6f hf y59c ff2 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">esteem. She was searching for something, but she did not know </div><div class="t m498 x6f hf y59d ff2 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">what. She still believed in God, but she had lost her hold on Him. </div><div class="t mb2 x1d hf y59e ff2 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">She was angry about what had happened to her. For more than 10 </div><div class="t m368 x1d hf y59f ff2 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">years she was adrift in a sea of uncertainty. </div><div class="t m4dc x10 hf y5a0 ff2 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Then she met another man, Michael, and they married. Linda </div><div class="t m4ad x1d hf y5a1 ff2 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">felt a strong pull to return to God. She began praying, and God </div><div class="t m60 x1d hf y5a2 ff2 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">gave her the victory over alcohol and tobacco. </div><div class="t mc7 x10 hf y5a3 ff2 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">An Adventist who lived in the same town as Linda had a small </div><div class="t m463 x1d hf y5a4 ff2 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">worship room on his land. She began attending worship with other </div><div class="t m4dd x1d hf y5a5 ff2 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Aboriginal Christians and was rebaptized. </div><div class="t m46e x10 hf y5a6 ff2 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">One day Linda heard about an Adventist-operated Bible school </div><div class="t m4de x1d hf y5a7 ff2 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">for Aborigines. She decided to attend the school to learn more </div><div class="t m4df x1d hf y5a8 ff2 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">about the Bible. When she told her husband of her decision, he was </div><div class="t m4e0 x1d hf y5a9 ff2 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sad that she wanted to go, but he gave his blessing. She attends </div><div class="t m4cc x1d hf y5f ff2 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">school two weeks every two months and studies on her own be-</div><div class="t m4e1 x1d hf y5aa ff2 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tween intense sessions. </div><div class="t m3ab x10 hf y5ab ff2 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Linda loves the Bible school and the truths that God is teaching </div><div class="t m4e2 x8 hf y5ac ff2 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">her there, even though such intense study is difficult for her. She is </div><div class="t m4a7 x8 hf y5ad ff2 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">learning how to share her faith with others, principles of health, </div><div class="t m464 x8 hf y5ae ff2 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and lifestyle changes along with Bible study. </div><div class="t m4e3 x10 hf y5af ff2 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">During the months Linda is at home, she visits her neighbors </div><div class="t m4e4 x8 hf y3ed ff2 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and patients in the hospital, sharing with them her love for the </div><div class="t mbc x43 hf y5b0 ff2 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Lord. </div><div class="t m4e5 x10 hf y5b1 ff2 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Today Linda is a leader in her little congregation in northern </div><div class="t m1b x8 hf y5b2 ff2 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Australia.
