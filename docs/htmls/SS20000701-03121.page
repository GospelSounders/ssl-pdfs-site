Mali is a large, landlocked </div><div class="t m3a8 x5a he y8ac ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">country located in the bulge of Africa. Most of the people are Muslim </div><div class="t m791 x5a he y729 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">or animist, but in spite of this, people are willing to listen to the gospel, </div><div class="t m792 x5c he y8ad ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and many are accepting Christianity. </div><div class="t m793 x6c he y6fc ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">We planned an evangelistic series in one town where the people are </div><div class="t m2ba x5a he y6fd ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">strongly influenced by animism and fetish worship. Through their </div><div class="t m340 x5a he y3d ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">traditional chief the people asked us if our God could protect them </div><div class="t m55 x5a he y6fe ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">from sorcerers, evil forces, and the curse of Allah if they decided to </div><div class="t me8 x5a he y578 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">become Christians. They asked us to show them the power of God. We </div><div class="t m197 x5a he y8ae ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">told them to look to the heavens, see the sun and moon and stars that </div><div class="t m794 x5a he y8af ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">God had hung in the sky. But they wanted tangible evidence. </div><div class="t m3b7 x6c he y8b0 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">That night as we presented our discussion, it began to rain hard. </div><div class="t m566 x5a he y8b1 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">This is rare in the desert of Mali, and the people became frightened and </div><div class="t m3ac x5a he y8b2 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">fled to their homes. Had God already begun to show His power? </div><div class="t m795 x6c he y8b3 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">That night I woke up feeling something cold on my thigh. I touched it </div><div class="t m796 x5a he y1c ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and immediately realized that it was a snake! If it was poisonous and it bit </div><div class="t m2fd x5a he y8b4 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">me, I could die. I cried out to God to deliver me from this snake, then </div><div class="t m797 x5a he y5a1 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">slowly I began to move, careful to not trap the snake in my trousers. </div><div class="t m160 x6c he y8b5 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The snake slithered down my trouser leg and onto the floor. I found </div><div class="t m74f x5a he y5a3 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">a flashlight and aimed it at the snake. It lay on the floor unmoving, as if </div><div class="t m798 x71 he y5a4 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">it was paralyzed. I recognized it as a </div><div class="t m799 x62 he y8b6 ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">worofi, </div><div class="t m4f3 x2f he y8b6 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">one of the deadliest snakes </div><div class="t m79a x71 he y48c ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in Africa. One strike would have killed me. I reached for the box in </div><div class="t m68f x71 he y48d ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">which I store my picture roll and struck the snake, killing it. </div><div class="t m79b x6c he y812 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Word spread through the town that the Adventist pastor had awak-</div><div class="t m4e0 x71 he y5a6 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ened to fmd a worofi in his trousers and survived. Villagers came to the </div><div class="t m794 x71 he y152 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">house to see for themselves the snake that could not kill me. &quot;Pastor,&quot; </div><div class="t m621 x71 he y153 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">they said, &quot;the worofi did not kill you. What a powerful God you have </div><div class="t m79c x71 he y57d ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that can protect you from the worofi. Surely He can protect us against </div><div class="t m45a x71 he y155 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">evil powers if we become Christians.&quot; </div><div class="t m79d x52 he y156 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">By that evening the story had spread to every home in the region. The </div><div class="t m79e x71 he y157 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">meeting place was packed with people. I told them the story of how Paul </div><div class="t m79f x71 he y158 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was saved from the bite of a serpent while on the island of Malta. </div><div class="t m49f x52 he y159 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">As a result of my encounter with the deadly worofi, seven people </div><div class="t m7a0 x71 he y15a ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">gave their lives to God and were baptized. Many others are preparing </div><div class="t m6f8 x15 he y15b ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">for baptism. Even the traditional chief, a strong Muslim, accepted a </div><div class="t m266 x15 he y15c ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Bible and is studying the Voice of Hope Bible course. </div><div class="t m7a1 x52 he y15d ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Pray for the people of Mali. It is not easy to become a Christian here. </div><div class="t m7a2 x52 h2b y15e ff3 fs1b fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Denis Patin&amp; is a pastor-evangelist interning in Mali. </div><div class="t m4d3 x52 he y580 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Produced by the General Conference Office of Mission Awareness </div><div class="t m7a3 x8d he y605 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">E-mail: gomissionggc.adventist.og </div><div class="t m709 x74 he y43e ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">119 </div></div><div class="pi" data-data='{"ctm":[1.000000,0.000000,0.000000,1.000000,0.000000,0.000000]}'></div></div>
