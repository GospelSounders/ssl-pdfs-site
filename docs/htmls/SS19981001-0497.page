I knew nothing about the </div><div class="t m4e1 x16 he y84a ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">church or the people who worshiped there, except that they were </div><div class="t m680 x16 he y84b ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">different. My friends and I sometimes threw stones and shouted </div><div class="t m95 x16 he y84c ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">accusations at the believers as we walked by the church. </div><div class="t m4be x2f he y84d ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Some years later a friend told me that, according to Revelation </div><div class="t m3f7 x16 he y84e ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">13, the Catholic and Protestant churches would combine and per-</div><div class="t m440 x16 he y84f ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">secute Christians who kept God&apos;s laws. I could not understand </div><div class="t m2d0 x16 he y850 ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">how Christians could hurt other Christians. Then I began to won-</div><div class="t m44f x16 he y851 ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">der who were these Christians who kept God&apos;s law. </div><div class="t m6a1 x2f he y852 ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Shortly after I was married, my wife became a Seventh-day Adventist. </div><div class="t m2f9 x35 he y853 ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I was not happy when she told me, for I still thought this church was </div><div class="t m307 x35 he y854 ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">a bad church. I got angry when she refused to go to the market or </div><div class="t m4dc x35 he y855 ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">cook on Saturday or when she refused to eat certain foods, even </div><div class="t m19a x35 he y856 ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">though she prepared them for me. But </div><div class="t m6a2 x93 h2f y856 ff6 fs1e fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I </div><div class="t m5d2 x50 he y856 ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">noticed that when I argued </div><div class="t m6a3 x35 he y857 ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">with her, she no longer argued back. Something had changed. </div><div class="t m5ac x32 he y858 ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I went to another area of Zaire to work in the gold mines. I </div><div class="t m4d6 x35 he y859 ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">discovered that the Adventist church was there too! Curious, I </div><div class="t m41f x35 he y3c9 ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">decided to attend a service. As I listened to the preacher and </div><div class="t m3a x35 he y3ca ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">studied the texts he gave, many of the things my wife did began to </div><div class="t m19b x35 he y85a ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">make sense to me. I liked the way Adventists worshiped too. They </div><div class="t m286 x35 he y85b ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">did not shout or play loud music as my church did. When I learned </div><div class="t m5fb x35 he y85c ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">about returning a tenth of my earnings to God, who gave them to </div><div class="t m3b0 x35 he y85d ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">me, I decided to try. I began returning tithe and waited to see what </div><div class="t m19c x35 he y85e ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">would happen. Not long after this I found a gold nugget weighing </div><div class="t m2ad x35 he y85f ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">about six pounds! </div><div class="t m4a0 x32 he y860 ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I returned to Kinshasa and began attending church with my wife.
