Following the baptism, Ali, a church mem-</div><div class="t m1a2 x5c h21 y52d ff3 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ber, shared this story: </div><div class="t m1fe x14 h21 y52e ff3 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">He and his family had fled the country of Mali as refugees. They </div><div class="t m2a8 x11 h21 y52f ff3 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">had traveled to several countries looking for work and a safe place to </div><div class="t m2f3 x11 h21 y530 ff3 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">live. Then Ali heard of an organization called ADRA, in Niger. He </div><div class="t m3e6 x11 h21 y3b1 ff3 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">contacted ADRA, hoping that someone could help him. He met the </div><div class="t m1e5 x11 h21 y531 ff3 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">local pastor, who listened to Ali&apos;s story and offered him hope. When </div><div class="t m7b x11 h21 y532 ff3 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Ali revealed that he was searching for answers to spiritual questions, </div><div class="t m44 x11 h21 y533 ff3 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the pastor gave him some material to read. Ali accepted the material </div><div class="t m3c5 x11 h21 y3b4 ff3 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and later began studying a Bible correspondence course. As he stud-</div><div class="t me5 x11 h21 y534 ff3 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ied, he found answers to many of his questions. </div><div class="t m3e7 x16 h21 y535 ff3 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Ali wanted to tell his wife, Adama, about his new discoveries, but </div><div class="t m170 x11 h21 y3b6 ff3 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was not sure how. She was a faithful Muslim. Finally he decided to </div><div class="t m95 x11 h21 y536 ff3 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">invite her to church on Sabbath morning. When they arrived at church, </div><div class="t m3e8 x11 h21 ya4 ff3 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Adama was shocked. &quot;How could you do this?&quot; she demanded. &quot;This </div><div class="t m260 x11 h21 y62 ff3 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">is terrible! You have brought me to a Christian church!&quot; Adama went </div><div class="t m3c2 x11 h21 y3b8 ff3 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">home, packed her belongings, and returned to her village. </div><div class="t m24 x16 h21 y537 ff3 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Ali was confused. What had he done? A few days later Ali was </div><div class="t m264 x11 h21 y538 ff3 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">summoned to appear before the marabous (Koran teachers) to answer </div><div class="t m3e9 x11 h21 y539 ff3 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">his wife&apos;s charges. They tried to convince him to give up his interest in </div><div class="t m2e3 x11 h21 y53a ff3 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Christianity. &quot;What you did was very serious,&quot; they told him. &quot;With </div><div class="t m3c5 x11 h21 y53b ff3 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Christians we do not even eat!&quot; </div><div class="t m31f x16 h21 y53c ff3 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Ali told them simply, &quot;One day the Lord will judge me and my </div><div class="t m55 x11 h21 y3bd ff3 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">choices. And my wife alone must decide whether to return to me and </div><div class="t m34 x11 h21 y3bf ff3 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">our children or to give up the family forever.&quot; </div><div class="t m3ea x45 h21 y53d ff3 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Adama returned home to her family, but was not interested in </div><div class="t m235 x11 h21 y53e ff3 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Christianity. Ali was becoming discouraged. His problem seemed too </div><div class="t m74 x11 h21 y53f ff3 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">big to handle; he was ready to give up Christianity. </div><div class="t m31d x45 h21 y540 ff3 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">On Christmas morning Adama asked her husband, &quot;What gift do </div><div class="t m3a9 x30 h21 y541 ff3 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">you have for me?&quot; Noting the look of surprise on his face, she </div><div class="t m3eb x30 h21 y542 ff3 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">continued, &quot;I know that Christians give gifts on Christmas.&quot; But Ali </div><div class="t m3a3 x30 h21 y543 ff3 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">had no gifts to give that day. &quot;Never mind,&quot; Adama answered. </div><div class="t m3ec x92 h24 y543 ff2 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;I </div><div class="t m266 x98 h21 y543 ff3 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">have </div><div class="t m1b5 x30 h21 y544 ff3 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">a gift for you. I will come to church with you.&quot; </div><div class="t m356 x45 h21 y545 ff3 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Ali was thrilled when his wife joined him for church. Later she </div><div class="t m22a x30 h21 y546 ff3 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">began Bible studies. And on that Sabbath day Adama was baptized. </div><div class="t m2d9 x30 h21 y547 ff3 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">For Ali it was the best gift! </div><div class="t m17c x15 h24 y548 ff2 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">David Ferraro is president of the Niger Mission in the Sahel </div><div class="t m127 x30 h24 y549 ff2 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Union of West Africa. </div><div class="t m235 x47 h21 y54a ff3 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">For Current Newsbreak, Call I -800-648-5824. </div></div><div class="pi" data-data='{"ctm":[1.000000,0.000000,0.000000,1.000000,0.000000,0.000000]}'></div></div>
