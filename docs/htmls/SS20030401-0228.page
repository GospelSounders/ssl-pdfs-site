Instead, Christ&apos;s death struck at the heart of sin, at the </div><div class="t m34c x18 h14 y2bc ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">principle of sin as sin. Ultimately, He came to destroy sin itself. </div><div class="t m338 x19 h14 y5a ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Thus, &quot;godly sorrow,&quot; the kind that leads to repentance, is sorrow </div><div class="t ma9 x18 h14 y33e ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">for sin itself, for the principle behind it, as opposed to the immediate </div><div class="t m17d x18 h14 y206 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">consequences.
