Then I lost my father in war. When </div><div class="t m117 x44 he y364 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I heard about God, I blamed Him for my father&apos;s death. I didn&apos;t </div><div class="t m192 x44 he y276 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">want anything to do with a God who kills fathers. </div><div class="t m144 x46 he y278 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Even in grade school, partying, drinking, and smoking were a </div><div class="t m1b6 x44 he y279 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">big thing. I joined my friends in these activities when I could. We </div><div class="t m223 x44 he y368 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">did not care about God or the future, our health, or our education. </div><div class="t m24c x44 he y27b ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The only thing important to us was partying and making jokes to </div><div class="t m3e4 x44 he y16 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">impress others. </div><div class="t m153 x46 he y27d ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">However, something happened that changed my life. An old </div><div class="t m2b6 x44 he y369 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">woman came to our door selling books. My mother did not have </div><div class="t m153 x44 he y36a ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the heart to refuse her, so she bought a book, </div><div class="t m39a x62 he y36a ff6 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Steps to Christ. </div><div class="t m3e5 x22 he y36a ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">A </div><div class="t m3e6 x44 he y3a0 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">few days later the woman came to talk about God. Mom was </div><div class="t m3e7 x44 he y36b ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">polite and listened, but I was bored, so I left. The woman came </div><div class="t m23c x44 he y280 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">often to our house, and sometimes I stayed to listen. In time I </div><div class="t m8a x44 he y36c ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">grew fond of the old woman. </div><div class="t m1ed x46 he y281 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Time passed, and I started high school. I met a really nice girl </div><div class="t mb8 x44 he y36d ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">named Suzana. I learned that Suzana belonged to a church I had </div><div class="t m3e8 x44 he y4b0 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">never heard of, the Seventh-day Adventist church. I was sure that </div><div class="t m2c0 x44 he y36e ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was the same church the old woman attended. </div><div class="t m3e9 x46 he y4b1 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Then one day the old woman did not come to our house. I </div><div class="t m3ea x44 he y4b2 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">asked Suzana where the woman was, and Suzana said the woman </div><div class="t m351 x44 he y36f ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">died. I was shaken by this news. Suddenly I wanted to visit the </div><div class="t m1ac x44 he y4b3 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">church that this dear old woman had attended. Suzana was happy </div><div class="t m353 x44 he y371 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to invite me. </div><div class="t m3eb x55 he y285 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">From then on, I have attended the Adventist church. Even </div><div class="t m174 x44 he y372 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">when people tried to convince me not to go, I went. I learned that </div><div class="t m39 x51 he y287 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">God loves all of His children, that it is Satan who wants people to </div><div class="t m3a1 x51 he y4b4 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">suffer. This helped me understand my father&apos;s death. </div><div class="t mc7 x55 he y374 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">By studying Christ&apos;s life, my own life changed. I stopped drink-</div><div class="t m283 x51 he y375 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ing and attending parties that I knew were not pleasing to God. </div><div class="t m3ec x51 he y376 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Friends noticed the changes in my life and wondered what had </div><div class="t m3ed x51 he y28c ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">happened to me. At the time I isolated myself from all my friends </div><div class="t m11e x51 he y3a3 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">outside the church, but by doing so I lost a chance to share God&apos;s </div><div class="t m3ee x51 he y28e ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">love with them. Today I realize that was a mistake. I feel sad that I </div><div class="t m3ef x51 he y28f ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">never accepted the nice old woman&apos;s invitation to attend church </div><div class="t m3c4 x51 he y3a4 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">while she was alive. But I believe that we will meet one day in </div><div class="t m3a1 x51 he y4b5 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">heaven, and she will see the results of her efforts. Her sweet life </div><div class="t m3f0 x51 he y378 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and persistent love helped bring me to Jesus. </div><div class="t m12 x55 h39 y291 ff5 fs17 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Ljljana Gunjevic is a teenager living in Lipik, Croatia. </div><div class="t m2e4 x70 h3a y4b6 ff2 fs17 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Produced by the Office of Mission </div><div class="t m3f1 x4a h3a y4b7 ff2 fs17 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Sabbath School-Personal Ministries department of the General Conference </div><div class="t m3f2 x70 h3a y4b8 ff2 fs17 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Email: gomission@gc.adventist.org </div><div class="t m25 x64 h3a y4b9 ff2 fs17 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">î˜‰</div><div class="t m3f3 x78 he y48d ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">37 </div></div><div class="pi" data-data='{"ctm":[1.000000,0.000000,0.000000,1.000000,0.000000,0.000000]}'></div></div>
