Then I lost my father in war. When </div><div class="t m117 x43 hc y363 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I heard about God, I blamed Him for my father&apos;s death. I didn&apos;t </div><div class="t m192 x43 hc y275 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">want anything to do with a God who kills fathers. </div><div class="t m144 x45 hc y277 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Even in grade school, partying, drinking, and smoking were a </div><div class="t m1b6 x43 hc y278 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">big thing. I joined my friends in these activities when I could. We </div><div class="t m223 x43 hc y367 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">did not care about God or the future, our health, or our education. </div><div class="t m24c x43 hc y27a ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The only thing important to us was partying and making jokes to </div><div class="t m3e4 x43 hc y15 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">impress others. </div><div class="t m153 x45 hc y27c ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">However, something happened that changed my life. An old </div><div class="t m2b6 x43 hc y368 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">woman came to our door selling books. My mother did not have </div><div class="t m153 x43 hc y369 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the heart to refuse her, so she bought a book, </div><div class="t m39a x61 hc y369 ff6 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Steps to Christ. </div><div class="t m3e5 x21 hc y369 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">A </div><div class="t m3e6 x43 hc y39f ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">few days later the woman came to talk about God. Mom was </div><div class="t m3e7 x43 hc y36a ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">polite and listened, but I was bored, so I left. The woman came </div><div class="t m23c x43 hc y27f ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">often to our house, and sometimes I stayed to listen. In time I </div><div class="t m8a x43 hc y36b ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">grew fond of the old woman. </div><div class="t m1ed x45 hc y280 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Time passed, and I started high school. I met a really nice girl </div><div class="t mb8 x43 hc y36c ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">named Suzana. I learned that Suzana belonged to a church I had </div><div class="t m3e8 x43 hc y4af ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">never heard of, the Seventh-day Adventist church. I was sure that </div><div class="t m2c0 x43 hc y36d ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was the same church the old woman attended. </div><div class="t m3e9 x45 hc y4b0 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Then one day the old woman did not come to our house. I </div><div class="t m3ea x43 hc y4b1 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">asked Suzana where the woman was, and Suzana said the woman </div><div class="t m351 x43 hc y36e ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">died. I was shaken by this news. Suddenly I wanted to visit the </div><div class="t m1ac x43 hc y4b2 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">church that this dear old woman had attended. Suzana was happy </div><div class="t m353 x43 hc y370 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to invite me. </div><div class="t m3eb x54 hc y284 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">From then on, I have attended the Adventist church. Even </div><div class="t m174 x43 hc y371 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">when people tried to convince me not to go, I went. I learned that </div><div class="t m39 x50 hc y286 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">God loves all of His children, that it is Satan who wants people to </div><div class="t m3a1 x50 hc y4b3 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">suffer. This helped me understand my father&apos;s death. </div><div class="t mc7 x54 hc y373 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">By studying Christ&apos;s life, my own life changed. I stopped drink-</div><div class="t m283 x50 hc y374 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ing and attending parties that I knew were not pleasing to God. </div><div class="t m3ec x50 hc y375 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Friends noticed the changes in my life and wondered what had </div><div class="t m3ed x50 hc y28b ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">happened to me. At the time I isolated myself from all my friends </div><div class="t m11e x50 hc y3a2 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">outside the church, but by doing so I lost a chance to share God&apos;s </div><div class="t m3ee x50 hc y28d ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">love with them. Today I realize that was a mistake. I feel sad that I </div><div class="t m3ef x50 hc y28e ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">never accepted the nice old woman&apos;s invitation to attend church </div><div class="t m3c4 x50 hc y3a3 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">while she was alive. But I believe that we will meet one day in </div><div class="t m3a1 x50 hc y4b4 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">heaven, and she will see the results of her efforts. Her sweet life </div><div class="t m3f0 x50 hc y377 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and persistent love helped bring me to Jesus. </div><div class="t m12 x54 h35 y290 ff5 fs17 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Ljljana Gunjevic is a teenager living in Lipik, Croatia. </div><div class="t m2e4 x6f h36 y4b5 ff2 fs17 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Produced by the Office of Mission </div><div class="t m3f1 x49 h36 y4b6 ff2 fs17 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Sabbath School-Personal Ministries department of the General Conference </div><div class="t m3f2 x6f h36 y4b7 ff2 fs17 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Email: gomission@gc.adventist.org </div><div class="t m25 x63 h36 y4b8 ff2 fs17 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">î˜‰</div><div class="t m3f3 x77 hc y48c ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">37 </div></div><div class="pi" data-data='{"ctm":[1.000000,0.000000,0.000000,1.000000,0.000000,0.000000]}'></div></div>
