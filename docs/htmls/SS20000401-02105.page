But an eight- month drought had left the nearby river </div><div class="t m6fc x50 h2a y954 ff5 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">dry. Some skeptical villagers jeered at the Adventists, who insisted on </div><div class="t m599 x50 h2a y2f6 ff5 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">baptizing by immersion, even when there was no water. The only </div><div class="t m44 x50 h2a y2f7 ff5 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">alternative was to baptize the new believers in an oil drum. The day </div><div class="t m6fd x50 h2a y2f8 ff5 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">before the baptism, the believers carried water to fill the barrel. That </div><div class="t m6fe x50 h2a y2f9 ff5 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">evening they gathered for vespers and once more asked God for rain, </div><div class="t m56b x50 h2a y2fa ff5 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">though the skies were clear. </div><div class="t m45 x67 h2a y2fb ff5 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The next morning Joe saw puddles of water outside his door.
