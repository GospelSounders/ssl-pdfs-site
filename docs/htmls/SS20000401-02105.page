But an eight- month drought had left the nearby river </div><div class="t m6fc x4f h27 y953 ff5 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">dry. Some skeptical villagers jeered at the Adventists, who insisted on </div><div class="t m599 x4f h27 y2f5 ff5 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">baptizing by immersion, even when there was no water. The only </div><div class="t m44 x4f h27 y2f6 ff5 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">alternative was to baptize the new believers in an oil drum.
