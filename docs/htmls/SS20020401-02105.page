One day he received word that his brother, </div><div class="t m4e0 x75 h15 ya12 ff2 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">who lived in Canada, was coming to visit. </div><div class="t m79d x31 h15 ya13 ff2 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Awil welcomed his brother, who stayed for a week. During </div><div class="t m670 x75 h15 ya14 ff2 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">their visit, Awil learned that his brother had become a Christian. </div><div class="t m1af x75 h15 ya15 ff2 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Awil knew virtually nothing about Christianity and listened with </div><div class="t m38a x69 h15 ya16 ff2 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">interest to his brother&apos;s testimony. Then his brother left to visit </div><div class="t m658 x75 h15 yb5 ff2 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the rest of the family in Somalia. Unfortunately, while crossing </div><div class="t mc3 x75 h15 ya17 ff2 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the border, he was caught in crossfire and was killed. </div><div class="t m16a x31 h15 yb7 ff2 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Awil was devastated by his brother&apos;s death. One day while he </div><div class="t m79e x75 h15 ydf ff2 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was looking through his brother&apos;s things, he found a Bible. He </div><div class="t m79f x69 h15 ya18 ff2 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">began reading it in secret, for he knew that his friends would </div><div class="t m2a1 x75 h15 yd8 ff2 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">despise him if they knew he was reading the Christian Bible. But </div><div class="t m568 x69 h15 ya19 ff2 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">as he read, he became convinced of its truth and God&apos;s power. He </div><div class="t m35b x69 h15 ya1a ff2 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">thought of becoming a Christian but worried what would happen </div><div class="t m1d7 x69 h15 ybd ff2 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to him if he did. In Somalia one could be put to death for changing </div><div class="t m65d x69 h15 ya1b ff2 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">religions. </div><div class="t m7a0 x31 h15 ybf ff2 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Awil moved to Uganda in search of a better life. There he </div><div class="t m38c x69 h15 ya1c ff2 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">heard a Somali-language radio program broadcast by Adventist </div><div class="t m80 x69 h15 yc1 ff2 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">World Radio. Awil was fascinated by the program and wrote to </div><div class="t m7a1 x69 h15 yc2 ff2 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the AWR offices in Nairobi, Kenya. He received a letter in re-</div><div class="t m7a2 x69 h15 ya1d ff2 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sponse, offering him encouragement. Soon letters, faxes, and </div><div class="t mf3 x69 h15 y5a ff2 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sometimes even telephone calls flew between Awil and the AWR </div><div class="t m2a1 x69 h15 ya1e ff2 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">staff. Awil decided to visit the AWR studio in person. </div><div class="t m7a3 x31 h15 y18f ff2 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">As he visited with the radio-program producer, he learned that </div><div class="t m6a7 x69 h15 y76c ff2 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">when Adventist World Radio began broadcasting in the Somali </div><div class="t m7a4 x1e h15 y76d ff2 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">language, there were no Adventist Christians who could speak </div><div class="t m28d x1e h15 ya1f ff2 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Somali. So the station invited a Christian who was not an Adventist </div><div class="t m97 x69 h15 ya20 ff2 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to produce the program.
