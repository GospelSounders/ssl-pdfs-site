She </div><div class="t m67d x29 h36 y2ea ff4 fs1c fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">invited the children to come sing songs about Jesus and listen to </div><div class="t m67e x29 h36 y4ac ff4 fs1c fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">stories. Thus, a children&apos;s Bible hour was born in that village. The </div><div class="t m394 x29 h36 y903 ff4 fs1c fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">little group of children grew so large that the headmaster&apos;s house, </div><div class="t m67f x29 h36 y4ae ff4 fs1c fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">where they met, could no longer hold them all. So he arranged to </div><div class="t m2c8 x29 h36 y904 ff4 fs1c fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">let Mere meet with the children in a room under the village&apos;s only </div><div class="t m444 x29 h36 y905 ff4 fs1c fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">church. </div><div class="t m680 x6f h36 y906 ff4 fs1c fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">One little girl, Susi, often attended the children&apos;s Bible hour. </div><div class="t m681 xa h36 y4b2 ff4 fs1c fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">When her grandmother learned she was attending the meetings, </div><div class="t m38d x29 h36 y4b3 ff4 fs1c fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">she told Susi not to go anymore. But Susi was determined not to </div><div class="t m47d x29 h36 y4b4 ff4 fs1c fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">miss the children&apos;s meeting, so she would sneak away from her </div><div class="t m5c8 x29 h36 y4b6 ff4 fs1c fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">work and stand outside the meeting room and listen through the </div><div class="t m682 x29 h36 y2f3 ff4 fs1c fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">windows. </div><div class="t m683 x9 h36 y4b8 ff4 fs1c fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Mere knew that Susi&apos;s grandmother forbade her to attend the </div><div class="t m3e5 xa h36 y907 ff4 fs1c fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">meetings, but she did not know that Susi was hiding outside and </div><div class="t m684 xa h36 y908 ff4 fs1c fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">listening. Apparently, Susi did this for several months. </div><div class="t m413 x9 h36 y4ba ff4 fs1c fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Eventually, Mere&apos;s heavy commitments in her own village forced </div><div class="t m4a8 xa h36 y4bb ff4 fs1c fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">her to stop holding the Bible-hour meetings.

During testimony time, one young </div><div class="t m2be xa h36 y90b ff4 fs1c fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">woman stood and told how she had first learned about the Adventist </div><div class="t m687 xa h36 y4bf ff4 fs1c fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">truth. She said, &quot;When I was a little girl, a woman came to our </div><div class="t m688 xa h36 y90c ff4 fs1c fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">village to hold story hour for children. I could not come in, be-</div><div class="t m689 xa h36 y4c1 ff4 fs1c fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">cause my grandmother prohibited me, but I stood outside and </div><div class="t m2c8 xa h36 y90d ff4 fs1c fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">listened.
