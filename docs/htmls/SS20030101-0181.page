One Sabbath </div><div class="t m67c x2a h3a y4ab ff4 fs1c fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">she visited a neighboring village where no Adventists live. She </div><div class="t m67d x2a h3a y2eb ff4 fs1c fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">invited the children to come sing songs about Jesus and listen to </div><div class="t m67e x2a h3a y4ad ff4 fs1c fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">stories. Thus, a children&apos;s Bible hour was born in that village. The </div><div class="t m394 x2a h3a y904 ff4 fs1c fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">little group of children grew so large that the headmaster&apos;s house, </div><div class="t m67f x2a h3a y4af ff4 fs1c fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">where they met, could no longer hold them all. So he arranged to </div><div class="t m2c8 x2a h3a y905 ff4 fs1c fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">let Mere meet with the children in a room under the village&apos;s only </div><div class="t m444 x2a h3a y906 ff4 fs1c fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">church. </div><div class="t m680 x70 h3a y907 ff4 fs1c fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">One little girl, Susi, often attended the children&apos;s Bible hour. </div><div class="t m681 xb h3a y4b3 ff4 fs1c fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">When her grandmother learned she was attending the meetings, </div><div class="t m38d x2a h3a y4b4 ff4 fs1c fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">she told Susi not to go anymore. But Susi was determined not to </div><div class="t m47d x2a h3a y4b5 ff4 fs1c fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">miss the children&apos;s meeting, so she would sneak away from her </div><div class="t m5c8 x2a h3a y4b7 ff4 fs1c fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">work and stand outside the meeting room and listen through the </div><div class="t m682 x2a h3a y2f4 ff4 fs1c fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">windows. </div><div class="t m683 xa h3a y4b9 ff4 fs1c fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Mere knew that Susi&apos;s grandmother forbade her to attend the </div><div class="t m3e5 xb h3a y908 ff4 fs1c fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">meetings, but she did not know that Susi was hiding outside and </div><div class="t m684 xb h3a y909 ff4 fs1c fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">listening. Apparently, Susi did this for several months. </div><div class="t m413 xa h3a y4bb ff4 fs1c fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Eventually, Mere&apos;s heavy commitments in her own village forced </div><div class="t m4a8 xb h3a y4bc ff4 fs1c fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">her to stop holding the Bible-hour meetings.

She said, &quot;When I was a little girl, a woman came to our </div><div class="t m688 xb h3a y90d ff4 fs1c fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">village to hold story hour for children. I could not come in, be-</div><div class="t m689 xb h3a y4c2 ff4 fs1c fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">cause my grandmother prohibited me, but I stood outside and </div><div class="t m2c8 xb h3a y90e ff4 fs1c fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">listened.
