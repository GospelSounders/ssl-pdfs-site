H. Zachary </div><div class="t m2e6 x64 h10 y2f5 ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Kesuli Zacari, a Muslim leader in Niger, was determined to convert </div><div class="t m2e7 x8 h10 y2d1 ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Christians to Islam. To do so he needed to understand what Christians </div><div class="t m2e8 x8 h10 y2d2 ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">believe. </div><div class="t m2e9 x64 h10 y2d3 ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">A Christian missionary gave Zacari a Gospel of John, but on the </div><div class="t m2ea x8 h10 y2d4 ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">way home he tossed the book into the bushes. A few days later, </div><div class="t m2e x8 h10 y2f6 ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">however, he changed his mind. He borrowed another copy from a </div><div class="t m2eb x8 h10 y2d6 ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Christian. As he read it he was impressed by the life of Jesus and how </div><div class="t m2ec x8 h10 y2d8 ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">He helped people. </div><div class="t m2ed x64 h10 y2f7 ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Zacari visited the missionary and asked her many questions about </div><div class="t m2ee x8 h10 y2f8 ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Jesus. He asked her for a New Testament, but the missionary did not </div><div class="t m2e8 x8 h10 y2f9 ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">give him one. When she was not looking, he stole a copy. </div><div class="t m2ef x64 h10 y2db ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Later his friends saw him reading the New Testament and warned </div><div class="t m2f0 x8 h10 y2dc ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">him, &quot;Watch out, or you will become a Christian.&quot; </div><div class="t ma8 x64 h10 y2fa ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;I am learning what Christians believe so I can convert them to </div><div class="t m2f1 x6a h10 y2dd ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Islam,&quot; he told them. </div><div class="t m1fc x64 h10 y2fb ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The stories of Jesus touched his heart. He lost interest in his </div><div class="t m2f2 x6a h10 y49 ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Muslim prayers and stopped going to the mosque. His mind was filled </div><div class="t m173 x6a h10 y2fc ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">with the scenes of Jesus. Zacari began to understand why Christians </div><div class="t m2f3 x8 h10 y2df ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">are so kind. It is the influence of Christ. </div><div class="t m2f4 x6c h10 y2e0 ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">But his mind was in a turmoil. Everything he had learned cried out </div><div class="t m2f5 x6a h10 y2e1 ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in favor of Islam, but Christ&apos;s love drew him to Christianity. Zacari </div><div class="t m2f6 x6a h10 yfa ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">decided to study Christianity for one month and then decide which </div><div class="t m2f7 x6a h10 y2fd ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">religion to follow. He visited the missionary again and plied her with </div><div class="t m2ef x6a h10 y2fe ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">questions. Finally he asked, &quot;How can I become a Christian?&quot; </div><div class="t m2f8 x6c h10 y2e3 ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The woman gave him a Bible. Zacari spent hours pouring over the </div><div class="t m2f9 x6a h10 y2ff ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Bible. The month passed. A year passed. Still he continued searching. </div><div class="t m2fa x6a h10 y300 ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">He discovered Adventist World Radio and wrote to the studio request-</div><div class="t m2fb x6a h10 y301 ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ing literature. He met the ADRA staff working in Niger. Their influ-</div><div class="t m2fc x6a h10 y302 ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ence helped Zacari make his decision. He gave up Islam and became </div><div class="t m2fd x6a h10 y303 ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">an Adventist Christian. </div><div class="t m2fe x5b h10 y304 ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Zacari says.
