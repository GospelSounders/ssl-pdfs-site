The marriage itself was not an elaborate cere-</div><div class="t m2ad x4 h2f y58 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">mony.

The supper was the big event. It lasted for </div><div class="t m7ed xa4 h2f ya47 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">days. The father of the groom usually took this occasion to confer some </div><div class="t m65a xa4 h2f ya48 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">special gift on his son.

Notice there were three calls made to </div><div class="t m7ef x4 h2f ya4e ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the marriage supper.
