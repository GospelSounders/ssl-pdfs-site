The marriage itself was not an elaborate cere-</div><div class="t m2ad x5 h32 y59 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">mony. It consisted of some public recognition which the bridegroom gave </div><div class="t m7c6 xa5 h32 ya46 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to the bride, such as throwing his coat over her as the procession moved </div><div class="t m6b0 xa5 h32 ya47 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">toward the place of the feast. The supper was the big event. It lasted for </div><div class="t m7ed xa5 h32 ya48 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">days. The father of the groom usually took this occasion to confer some </div><div class="t m65a xa5 h32 ya49 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">special gift on his son.
