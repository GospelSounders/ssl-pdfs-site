H.

He </div><div class="t m3d8 xa hc y1b0 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">remained for 12 years, mastering the writings of Buddha. He left the </div><div class="t m5e4 xa hc y1b1 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">monastery to teach history. Then in 1983 he and his wife fled Laos for </div><div class="t m2fa xa hc y1b2 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Thailand. </div><div class="t m688 x5c hc y1b3 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">While living in a refugee camp, Sakdarak met a Christian man who </div><div class="t m689 xa hc y2d4 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">talked to him about the Bible. One day his friend read John 1:1 to him. </div><div class="t m68a xa hc y1b5 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The verse startled Sakdarak. He recalled that Buddha had said that if his </div><div class="t m68b xa hc y2d5 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">followers obeyed the Word, they would be released from sin. Sakdarak </div><div class="t m68c xa hc y2d6 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">recalled other scriptures that told of the Messiah who would come. </div><div class="t m44f x5c hc y2d7 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">His friend gave him a Bible. As he read, he found the crucifixion </div><div class="t m68d xa hc y2d8 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">story. Sakdarak recalled that the Buddhist scriptures had stated that the </div><div class="t m5c5 xa hc y2d9 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">coming Messiah would have marks or circles in his hands and feet. </div><div class="t m3ef x5c hc y1bb ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">After two months of careful study, the former monk was baptized. </div><div class="t m68e xa hc y5b0 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">He began teaching the Bible to fellow refugees. He explained to them </div><div class="t m398 xa hc y1bd ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that the one message that runs through the teachings of Buddha is that </div><div class="t m5f3 xa hc y1be ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">those who find the true Word and obey it will be saved. Sakdarak </div><div class="t m4ef xa hc y2da ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">shared this good news with anyone who would listen. </div><div class="t m68f x5c hc y2db ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">But when he told his wife, Khanthaly, about his discovery, she did </div><div class="t m19a x5b hc y1c0 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">not share his joy. In fact, she took his Bible, threw it on the ground, and </div><div class="t m3a3 xa hc y1c1 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">jumped on it. Within her culture this was the highest level of insult one </div><div class="t m5e7 x5b hc y48 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">could give. </div><div class="t m690 x5c hc y1c3 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Sakdarak was crushed at his wife&apos;s response. For two weeks the </div><div class="t ma8 x5b hc y2df ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">couple did not speak or even look at each other. A divorce seemed </div><div class="t m4a2 x5b hc y2e0 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">unavoidable. </div><div class="t m691 x5c hc y473 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Then one day Khanthaly reluctantly went to church with Sakdarak. </div><div class="t m1f8 x5b hc y2e2 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">A Laotian hymn touched her heart, and the Holy Spirit opened her </div><div class="t m430 x5b hc y474 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">understanding.
