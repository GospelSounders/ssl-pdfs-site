Then they noticed </div><div class="t m57f x49 h9 ya8b ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Rathi, the dead woman&apos;s house girl, in the house. She had no money, </div><div class="t m62e x49 h9 ya8c ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">so they beat her and locked her in a room. </div><div class="t m14a x11 h9 ya8d ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Police investigated the murder and learned that Rathi had been in </div><div class="t m6ba x49 h9 ya8e ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the house that day. They arrested her, and she was tried. In spite of a </div><div class="t m627 x49 h9 ya8f ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">lack of evidence, the judge found Rathi guilty of the woman&apos;s death </div><div class="t m2c9 x49 h9 y7eb ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and sentenced her to prison. </div><div class="t m6c6 x11 h9 ya90 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Locked in her jail cell, Rathi prayed to her family&apos;s and her village </div><div class="t mbb x49 h9 y7ed ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">gods. &quot;Please help me,&quot; she begged. &quot;You know I did not kill that </div><div class="t m77c x49 h9 ya91 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">woman.&quot; But years passed without any answer to her countless prayers. </div><div class="t m77d x49 h9 y7ef ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Rathi became discouraged. It seemed that no one would help her. </div><div class="t m4f6 x11 h9 y7f0 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Then two lay Bible workers began working in Rathi&apos;s home vil-</div><div class="t m307 x49 h9 y626 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">lage. One day as they visited from home to home, they heard the sad </div><div class="t m77e x49 h9 y7f1 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">story of Rathi. The next day they went to the jail to visit her. </div><div class="t m77f x11 h9 ya92 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">They shared with Rathi the story of Jesus. They told her how Christ </div><div class="t m780 x4a h9 y7f2 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">had spent his life helping others. Rathi was amazed that God Himself, </div><div class="t m163 x49 h9 y7f3 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">who could heal the sick and still the forces of nature, would take time </div><div class="t m781 x4a h9 y7f4 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to touch people&apos;s lives. &quot;Do you think that your Jesus can help me?&quot; </div><div class="t m53d x4a h9 y46d ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">she asked hopefully. &quot;I did nothing to deserve being here in jail.&quot; </div><div class="t m728 x6c h9 y648 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The two lay workers told her that Jesus answers prayer and then </div><div class="t m2da x4a h9 y7f5 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">offered an earnest prayer that Rathi would be released. &quot;Thank you for </div><div class="t m2ae x4a h9 y46f ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">visiting me,&quot; she said as they departed. </div><div class="t m16 x6c h9 y470 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The next day Rathi was set free. She learned that the police had </div><div class="t m445 x4a h9 y471 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">captured a gang of thieves who had confessed to killing Rathi&apos;s </div><div class="t m782 x4a h9 y472 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">employer. Rathi returned home convinced that God had stepped down </div><div class="t m514 x4a h9 y830 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">into her life and answered her visitors&apos; prayer. &quot;For more than three </div><div class="t m5c x4a h9 y474 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">years I prayed to the idols, and nothing happened,&quot; she told people. </div><div class="t m53d x4a h9 y475 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;But after just one prayer to Jesus, I was set free the next day.&quot; </div><div class="t m124 x6c h9 y476 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Rathi&apos;s happy family invited the two lay workers to come to their </div><div class="t m514 x29 h9 y832 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">home to tell them more about Jesus. Bible studies were started, and </div><div class="t m142 x29 h9 y478 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Rathi&apos;s entire family has been baptized. Rathi volunteered to become a </div><div class="t m783 x29 h9 y833 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Bible worker and has won several families to the Lord. Because the local </div><div class="t m784 x29 h9 y47a ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">mission is facing serious financial problems, they can give Rathi only 200 </div><div class="t m785 x29 h9 y834 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">rupees (about $4.45) a month. Her entire village is now receptive to the </div><div class="t m786 x29 h9 y835 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">message of Jesus, who listens to their prayers and answers them. </div><div class="t m36a x6f hf y47e ff7 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">J.
