It is, instead, a relationship between an offending </div><div class="t m98 x30 hb y9f ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">being and an offended God. </div><div class="t mbb x49 hb ya0 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Jesus Christ, through His incarnation, death, and resurrection, has </div><div class="t mbc x13 hb ya1 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">become the direct link between the offender and the offended. As God, </div><div class="t mbd x13 hb ya2 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">He reached into heaven; as man, He reached the earth; as both, He </div><div class="t mbe x13 hb y3f ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">spanned the gap between the two. He is, for us, a bridge across the </div><div class="t mbf x13 hb ya3 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">cosmos. In Him, and through Him, heaven and earth have become </div><div class="t mc0 x13 hb ya4 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">united. </div><div class="t m79 x49 hb ya5 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">How does it work? It is as simple as an exchange: Christ takes our </div><div class="t m5f x13 hb ya6 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sins and gives us His righteousness so that, through Him, we are </div><div class="t mc1 x13 hb ya7 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">accounted as righteous as God Himself. In this way, sin—that which </div><div class="t mc2 x13 hb ya8 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">formed the break between humankind and God to begin with—is no </div><div class="t mc3 x13 hb ya9 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">longer attributed to us; it no longer has to keep us separated from Him. </div><div class="t mc4 x13 hb yaa ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Murderers, adulterers, bigots, liars, thieves, and even the incestuous </div><div class="t mc5 x13 hb yab ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">can all be viewed as righteous as God Himself. And this wonderful gift, </div><div class="t mc6 x13 hb yac ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">this accounting of righteousness, comes to them by faith, and faith </div><div class="t mc7 x13 hb yad ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">alone. Hence the phrase &quot;righteousness by faith.&quot; </div><div class="t mc8 x49 hb yae ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">But it does not end there, either. Murderers, adulterers, bigots, </div><div class="t mc9 x4a hb yaf ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">liars, thieves, and even the incestuous can, through Jesus, enter into a </div><div class="t mca x13 hb yb0 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">relationship with God, because Jesus&apos; blood brings not only forgive-</div><div class="t mcb x13 hb yb1 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ness but cleansing, healing, and restoration. We are, through Christ, </div><div class="t mcc x13 hb yb2 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">born again, and through this experience God writes His holy law upon </div><div class="t mcd x4a hb yb3 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the fleshy tables of our hearts. Thus murderers, adulterers, bigots, </div><div class="t m78 x4a hb yb4 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">liars, thieves, and the incestuous no longer do the things they used to </div><div class="t mce x4a hb yb5 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">do. From and by this inward law, all of life is shaped for the believer. </div><div class="t mcf x4a hb yb6 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">These people desire to work out what God puts within them, and that </div><div class="t md0 x4a hb y50 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">desire is matched with the promise of Divine power. </div><div class="t mab x12 hb yb7 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">But this wonderful transformation does not happen in a vacuum. </div><div class="t m7d x4a hb yb8 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">God does not just arbitrarily do this work for some and not for others. </div><div class="t m9e x4a hb yb9 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">At the same time, He does not impose His saving grace upon us </div><div class="t mb0 x4a hb yba ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">against our will. Instead, responding to the prompting of His Holy </div><div class="t md1 x4a hb ybb ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Spirit, we enter into a special relationship with Him, a relationship that </div><div class="t md2 x4a hb ybc ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">is founded upon what the Bible calls &quot;the everlasting covenant,&quot; a </div><div class="t md3 x4a hb ybd ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">covenant sealed and ratified by blood—the blood of Christ. </div><div class="t md4 x12 hb ybe ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">This quarter we will study the covenant (or covenants).
