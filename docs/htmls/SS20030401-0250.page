In fact, he says in 1 Corinthians 5:3 that although he </div><div class="t m4c5 x3c h11 y134 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">has not been there in person to witness what was going on, he </div><div class="t m4c6 x3c h11 y135 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">nevertheless has already made a judgment about the person who </div><div class="t me7 x51 h11 y136 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;hath so done this deed&quot; (2 Cor. 5:3). </div><div class="t m4c7 x2b hf y138 ff3 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Read 1 Corinthians 5:4, 5.

First Corinthians, verse 5, is an especially difficult text. </div><div class="t m33c x3c hf y13c ff3 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">What do you think Paul is saying?

What does that mean? Commentators generally agree that what </div><div class="t m73 x3c h11 y181 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Paul seems to be saying here is that this person, by willfully defying </div><div class="t m4cb x3c h11 y13d ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the Lord, has severed Himself from the Lord, and the church is to </div><div class="t m244 x3c h11 y13e ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">acknowledge that choice by expelling him from the community of </div><div class="t m4cc x3c h11 y13f ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">faith. At the same time, too, Paul does not want them to give up on </div><div class="t mcf x3c h11 y140 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">him. There is a remedial element to be found in verse 5. The delivery </div><div class="t m4cd x3c h11 y141 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of a sinner to Satan appears also in 1 Timothy 1:20. The idea of the </div><div class="t m288 x51 h11 y24 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;destruction of the flesh&quot; (1 Cor. 5:15) perhaps could mean that </div><div class="t m3d7 x3c h11 y142 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">because of the chastisement the man will put away his sinful actions </div><div class="t m4e x3c h11 y144 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and as a result be saved &quot;in the day of the Lord Jesus&quot; (1 Cor. 5:5). </div><div class="t m1de x2b hf y29a ff3 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Read 1 Timothy 1:20. </div><div class="t m4ce x55 h11 y29a ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">What parallel can you find there with </div><div class="t m4cf x51 h11 y148 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">what Paul says to the Corinthians regarding the fate of this man? </div><div class="t m334 x2b h11 y2be ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">However difficult the phraseology, Paul&apos;s point seems clear: The </div><div class="t m9b x51 h11 y14c ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">man needs to be disfellowshiped for this deed. Perhaps, however, he </div><div class="t m24d x51 h11 y14d ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">will change his ways, as a result.
