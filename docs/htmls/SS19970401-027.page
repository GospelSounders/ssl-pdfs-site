In the </div><div class="t ma6 x47 h1f yb0 ff3 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">letters of John we have a firsthand description of the excitement of </div><div class="t ma7 x47 h1f yb1 ff3 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">knowing God. Every verse proclaims: What a God! Added to this is </div><div class="t ma8 x47 h1f yb2 ff3 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the central conviction that without God there is no hope, no assur-</div><div class="t ma9 x47 h1f yb3 ff3 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ance, no salvation, and no love—for God Himself </div><div class="t maa x2c h1f yb4 ff5 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">is </div><div class="t mab x48 h1f yb3 ff3 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">love.

That is why at times he speaks </div><div class="t mb5 x47 h1f ybe ff3 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">so strongly. For John and for us, these are life-and-death matters. He </div><div class="t mb6 x47 h1f ybf ff3 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">writes because he wants no one to miss out on a living relationship </div><div class="t mb7 x47 h1f yc0 ff3 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">with the Saviour. </div><div class="t mb8 x21 h1f yc1 ff3 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">John writes as the elder statesman of the church.

In 1 John he does not identify himself at all—and in reality </div><div class="t mbc x24 h1f yc4 ff3 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">he does not have to. There is no doubt as to who is writing. In style, </div><div class="t mbd x24 h1f yc5 ff3 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in content, and in personal enthusiasm this is the same John who </div><div class="t mbe x24 h1f yc6 ff3 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">wrote: &quot;In the beginning was the Word&quot; (John 1:1).
