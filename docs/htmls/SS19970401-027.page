In the </div><div class="t ma6 x48 h23 yb1 ff3 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">letters of John we have a firsthand description of the excitement of </div><div class="t ma7 x48 h23 yb2 ff3 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">knowing God. Every verse proclaims: What a God! Added to this is </div><div class="t ma8 x48 h23 yb3 ff3 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the central conviction that without God there is no hope, no assur-</div><div class="t ma9 x48 h23 yb4 ff3 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ance, no salvation, and no love—for God Himself </div><div class="t maa x2d h23 yb5 ff5 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">is </div><div class="t mab x49 h23 yb4 ff3 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">love.

That is why at times he speaks </div><div class="t mb5 x48 h23 ybf ff3 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">so strongly. For John and for us, these are life-and-death matters. He </div><div class="t mb6 x48 h23 yc0 ff3 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">writes because he wants no one to miss out on a living relationship </div><div class="t mb7 x48 h23 yc1 ff3 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">with the Saviour. </div><div class="t mb8 x22 h23 yc2 ff3 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">John writes as the elder statesman of the church.

In 1 John he does not identify himself at all—and in reality </div><div class="t mbc x25 h23 yc5 ff3 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">he does not have to. There is no doubt as to who is writing.
