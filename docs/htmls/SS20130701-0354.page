He wanted to be sure that his ad for home improvements was </div><div class="t m0 x50 h4 y65e ff55 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls1 ws6c">attractive and his prices competitive. His eyes fell on the religious section </div><div class="t m0 x50 h4 y65f ff55 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls1 wse7">of classified ads.

The next day he placed the ad in the paper.</div><div class="t m0 x6 h4 y663 ff55 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls1 ws27">His phone began ringing.

I want to </div><div class="t m0 x50 h4 y66c ff55 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls2 ws70">know about God while I have time.” Alexei opened his Bible and read several </div><div class="t m0 x50 h4 y66d ff55 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls2 ws67">verses about God. Then they watched an evangelistic video. For 10 days the </div><div class="t m0 x50 h4 y66e ff55 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls2 ws38">two studied God’s Word together.
