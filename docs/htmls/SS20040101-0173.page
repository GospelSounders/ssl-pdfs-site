His father </div><div class="t m179 xd4 h3 y70a ff1 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">drank and often did not come home for weeks at a time. When he did, he </div><div class="t m417 xd4 h3 y70b ff1 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">often beat Joel, the eldest son. Joel&apos;s classmates at school took drugs and </div><div class="t m619 xd4 h3 y70c ff1 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">offered Joel drugs, just to try them. But Joel refused. He was not a </div><div class="t m1c3 xd4 h3 y70d ff1 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Christian, but he knew drugs and alcohol messed up people&apos;s minds and </div><div class="t m438 xd4 h3 y9f ff1 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">lives, and he wanted nothing to do with them. </div><div class="t m5cc x1 h3 y4ef ff1 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">When Joel&apos;s father beat his mother, she often took Joel to the local </div><div class="t m33 xd4 h3 y70e ff1 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">church to pray. Joel sensed that religion was key to a more stable life. He </div><div class="t m61a xd4 h3 y4f1 ff1 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">began going on his own and made friends at the church. Joel wanted to </div><div class="t m543 xd4 h3 y4f2 ff1 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">know more about Jesus and God&apos;s plan for his life. </div><div class="t m514 x1 h3 y4f3 ff1 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Then his father had an accident that nearly killed him. As he recovered </div><div class="t m2b xd4 h3 y4f4 ff1 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in the hospital, he began to realize that he needed to change his life. And </div><div class="t m19d xd4 h3 y4f5 ff1 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">when Christians offered him Bible studies, he accepted. </div><div class="t m61b xbe h3 y4f6 ff1 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">An Adventist man visited the family and prayed with them. Joel </div><div class="t m20b xd4 h3 y4f7 ff1 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">wanted to know more about what this man&apos;s church taught. The family </div><div class="t m42a xd4 h3 y4f8 ff1 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">studied the Bible together and grew in their knowledge of God and their </div><div class="t m61c xd4 h3 y70f ff1 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">faith in Jesus. His father gave up his alcohol, and the family began </div><div class="t m5e4 xd4 h3 y4fa ff1 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">attending the Adventist church. Soon they were baptized. </div><div class="t m61d xbe h3 y710 ff1 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Joel was thirsty to know more about God. He studied his Bible and </div><div class="t m61e xd4 h3 yda ff1 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">grew in faith and in knowledge. He became a deacon at age 14 and </div><div class="t m42c xd4 h3 y4fb ff1 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">began to preach when the pastor was away. He became the youth leader </div><div class="t m44a xd4 h3 y5e8 ff1 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">while still a youth himself. Joel&apos;s pastor saw potential in Joel and urged </div><div class="t m387 xd4 h3 y711 ff1 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the boy to consider preparing for the ministry. Joel felt unworthy of the </div><div class="t m502 xd4 h3 y4fc ff1 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">calling, but he agreed to pray about it. Joel accepted God&apos;s call, but how </div><div class="t m86 xd4 h3 y712 ff1 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">could he afford university? His family was very poor. </div><div class="t m5d9 x68 h3 y4fe ff1 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Joel prayed that God would provide the tuition for his studies.
