He talked loudly, and was slow to catch on. </div><div class="t m641 x5c h21 ybba ff3 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Poor, simple, and dirty, he smoked, and often was seen staggering </div><div class="t m33e x5c h21 ybbb ff3 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">drunk down the streets. No one thought he would ever amount to </div><div class="t m520 x5c h21 ybbc ff3 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">anything. When he first came to our church, our members tried to </div><div class="t m363 x5c h21 y6c3 ff3 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">accept him, but he was so different. </div><div class="t m346 x4f h21 y6c4 ff3 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Fatherless and poor, he was raised by a simple-minded mother </div><div class="t m317 x5c h21 y6c5 ff3 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in a two-room house with no bathroom. An Adventist neighbor </div><div class="t m61a x5c h21 y6c6 ff3 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">visited them and encouraged Olek to read the Bible. When Olek </div><div class="t me3 x5c h21 ybbd ff3 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">asked the local priest questions about the Sabbath, the priest </div><div class="t m75a x5c h21 ybbe ff3 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">became angry. That is when Olek began to attend our church. </div><div class="t m3 x4f h21 ybbf ff3 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Olek had tried repeatedly to stop smoking, but with encourage-</div><div class="t m750 x5c h21 ybc0 ff3 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ment and many prayers, Olek successfully beat the habit. He began </div><div class="t m5b0 x5c h21 y6cb ff3 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">using a bathtub, and soon smelled better. As he read the Bible, he </div><div class="t m44c x5c h21 ybc1 ff3 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">made other changes in his life. He began to wear the clean clothes </div><div class="t m4f4 x4 h21 y6cd ff3 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">we gave him, and washed his hair more often. He became quieter, </div><div class="t ma8 x4 h21 y6ce ff3 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and more reasonable. He quit drinking coffee, eating unclean meats, </div><div class="t m399 x4 h21 y6cf ff3 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and finally, after a difficult struggle, he gave up his beloved beer. </div><div class="t m67e x4f h21 ybc2 ff3 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">He began preaching the gospel to anyone who would listen. One </div><div class="t m750 x4 h21 y6d1 ff3 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">day he saw a priest sitting on a bench reading a book. Olek thought </div><div class="t m5b4 x4 h21 y6d2 ff3 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the priest was reading the Bible. He greeted him and said, &quot;I see </div><div class="t m762 x4 h21 ybc3 ff3 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">you are interested in the Bible.&quot; The priest said &quot;Yes I am, but let&apos;s </div><div class="t m9d x4 h21 y6d4 ff3 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">not talk about it here; come to my house.&quot; </div><div class="t m142 x41 h21 y6d5 ff3 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Although Poland is a &quot;Christian&quot; country, people who dare to </div><div class="t m763 x4 h21 y6d6 ff3 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">change religions meet with opposition.
