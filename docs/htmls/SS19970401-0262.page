But, as when Jesus was faced with </div><div class="t m281 x4a h16 y502 ff3 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the woman taken in adultery, God says to us, &quot;Neither do I condemn </div><div class="t m51 x4a h16 y57b ff3 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">you,&quot; with the added command, &quot;Do not sin again&quot; (John 8:11, RSV). </div><div class="t m378 x4a h16 y1f5 ff3 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">And should you feel worried about what you have done, and hesitant </div><div class="t mdd x4a h16 y503 ff3 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">even to mention this in prayer, remember that God knows everything, </div><div class="t mcd x4a h16 y57d ff3 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and He is greater than our hearts.
