He grew up </div><div class="t m36f x2a h19 y3c9 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">attending church and singing in the choir, but as a teenager he became </div><div class="t m204 x13 h19 y21f ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">disenchanted and left the church. </div><div class="t m370 x4a h19 y3ca ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">People praised his musical ability, and Luis dreamed of becoming </div><div class="t m371 x13 h19 y3cb ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">famous. When church members told him that his voice was a gift from </div><div class="t m372 x13 h19 y222 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">God and should be used only for God&apos;s glory, he began to resent God. </div><div class="t m373 x4a h19 y3cc ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Luis drifted away from church. He wanted to live his own life, a life </div><div class="t m374 x13 h19 y3cd ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in which God did not play a large part. </div><div class="t m375 x4a h19 y225 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">After college he began studying voice with a well-known voice </div><div class="t m2be x13 h19 y3ce ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">teacher, Dorm Isabel, and the two developed a friendship. When he </div><div class="t m376 x13 h19 y227 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">married, Dofia Isabel invited Luis and his wife, Vicky, to join a small </div><div class="t m377 x13 h19 y228 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">group that met near their home. Luis did not want to go, but Vicky </div><div class="t m305 x13 h19 y54 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">yearned for a closer walk with God. Finally Luis accepted Dolia </div><div class="t m378 x13 h19 y229 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Isabel&apos;s invitation to attend the small group meeting. </div><div class="t m204 x6c h19 y3cf ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Luis was impressed with the speaker&apos;s understanding of the Bible. </div><div class="t mb4 x13 h19 y22b ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Luis and Vicky continued attending the small group meeting. Luis </div><div class="t m19e x13 h19 y22c ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">liked the group Bible study, but Vicky was concerned that he might </div><div class="t m379 x13 h19 y22d ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">want to change religions. But when the leader invited those present to </div><div class="t m37a x13 h19 y5b ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">surrender their lives to Christ, both Vicky and Luis stood. </div><div class="t m262 x6c h19 y22e ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Luis realized that he had never really understood God before. </div><div class="t m37b x13 h19 y22f ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Every day he fell more deeply in love with God. God began filling </div><div class="t m37c x13 h19 y3d0 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">every aspect of the Cano&apos;s lives.
