But for him farming is simply a means to earn a </div><div class="t mc5 x9 hd yad3 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">living. His real love is evangelism. </div><div class="t m2af x20 hd yad4 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Although he grew up in a religious home, as a teenager religion </div><div class="t m199 x9 hd yad5 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">never stopped him from doing the things he considered fun, such </div><div class="t m288 x9 hd y5bd ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">as going to movies, dances, and cockfights. &quot;Life was good,&quot; he </div><div class="t m452 x9 hd yad6 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">said. &quot;And I planned to get the most out of it!&quot; </div><div class="t m1c1 x20 hd y7e1 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">But when he was 19 years old, he met Jesus Christ, and every-</div><div class="t m57f x9 hd y59f ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">thing changed. </div><div class="t m4d8 x20 hd yad7 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">When his family was invited to attend evangelistic meetings, </div><div class="t m780 x36 hd yad8 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Mathurin decided to go. He was deeply moved as the speaker </div><div class="t m781 x36 hd y5c2 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">revealed Jesus Christ from the Bible. But he had no intention of </div><div class="t m53d x36 hd yad9 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">becoming an Adventist and having to give up cockfights and </div><div class="t m446 x36 hd y5c4 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">dancing. </div><div class="t m37 x59 hd yada ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Then he learned about the Sabbath. He asked his priest why </div><div class="t m23f x36 hd yadb ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">some Christians keep the Sabbath and others don&apos;t. The priest </div><div class="t m2be x36 hd ye3 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">responded honestly. &quot;The Sabbath day is Saturday; we observe </div><div class="t m738 x36 hd y7e2 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Sunday to honor Jesus&apos; resurrection.&quot; </div><div class="t m4ae x59 hd y7e3 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Mathurin was troubled. He wanted to be saved, spared from the </div><div class="t m43b x36 hd y1d ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">eternal fire reserved for Satan and his angels. But how could he be </div><div class="t m2bf x36 hd y7e4 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">saved if he did not obey God&apos;s law? He tried to ignore these new </div><div class="t m4ef x36 hd y7e5 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">truths, but his conscience would not let him. Finally he surren-</div><div class="t m2fd x36 hd y7e6 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">dered his life to Christ and was baptized. The rest of his family </div><div class="t m38c x36 hd y7e7 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">soon joined him. </div><div class="t m766 x59 hd y5cc ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Today Mathurin&apos;s family finds their greatest joy in seeing others </div><div class="t m205 x5a hd y7e9 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">come to know Jesus Christ as the Lord of their life. They sell farm </div><div class="t m5b4 x5a hd y5ce ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">products, including goat milk, to their neighbors. Often they include </div><div class="t m2df x5a hd y7eb ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">a book, a magazine, or literature with their milk deliveries. </div><div class="t m42e x59 hd y5d0 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">One customer has a sign on his house that says, &quot;No Jehovah&apos;s </div><div class="t m157 x5a hd y4dd ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Witnesses or Adventists allowed.&quot; Mathurin had given the family </div><div class="t m672 x5a hd y7ec ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">magazines before, but they had seemed unreceptive. Then last </div><div class="t m1f7 x5a hd y7ed ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">year the family was not getting milk deliveries and did not receive </div><div class="t m555 x5a hd ya44 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the gift books Mathurin gave to customers. When the family </div><div class="t m5cc x5a hd y6f8 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">resumed milk deliveries, they asked if they could get the gift </div><div class="t m782 x5a hd y7ee ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">books as well!
