The professor in charge stepped </div><div class="t mfa x39 h24 yf1 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">into the hallway for a few minutes. When he returned he said: &quot;The li-</div><div class="t mfb x72 h24 yf2 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">brarian is here. Apparently someone took the </div><div class="t mfc x46 h24 yf2 ff7 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">S.D.A. Bible Commentary </div><div class="t mfd x72 h24 yf3 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">volume on Isaiah out of the library last night. Students looking for it this </div><div class="t mfe x72 h24 yf4 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">morning to study for this exam could not find it. Would the culprit stand </div><div class="t mff x72 h24 yf5 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">up, go get the book, and return it to the library?&quot; The heart of a young </div><div class="t m100 x72 h24 yf6 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">minister-to-be began to race as he realized he had made a terrible mis-</div><div class="t m101 x72 h24 yf7 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">take. He had been getting an &quot;A&quot; in the class and did not want to lose it </div><div class="t m102 x72 h24 yf8 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">on the final exam. The night before he had come to the conclusion that </div><div class="t m103 x72 h24 yf9 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">without several hours&apos; more work with the commentary he probably </div><div class="t m104 x72 h24 yfa ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">would lose his &quot;A.&quot; The commentaries that were allowed to be taken out </div><div class="t m105 x72 h24 yfb ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of the library were gone; only those to be used in the library remained. </div><div class="t m106 x73 h24 yfc ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">But the library was closing. He thought it would be all right to take the </div><div class="t m107 x72 h24 yfd ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">volume he was using home and return it the moment the library door </div><div class="t m108 x72 h24 yfe ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">opened the next morning. No one even would suspect it had been taken. </div><div class="t m109 x61 h24 yff ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">He went to bed about 2:00 a.m., setting the clock for 6:45. But somehow </div><div class="t m10a x72 h24 y100 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the alarm did not go off when planned and he woke up at 8:30. The exam </div><div class="t m10b x72 h24 y101 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was at nine. &quot;Too late now,&quot; he said to himself as he dressed. &quot;I&apos;ll have </div><div class="t m10c x61 h24 y102 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to put that book back later and hope no one notices.&quot; </div><div class="t m10d x73 h24 y103 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Sitting in the classroom, he could feel his face flushing. No one sus-</div><div class="t m10e x61 h24 y104 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">pected him. He was a senior theology major and a student leader in reli-</div><div class="t m10f x72 h24 y105 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">gious activities. He noticed that those in the classroom had stopped writ-</div><div class="t m110 x61 h24 y106 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ing their exams. They were waiting to see if anyone would stand up. He </div><div class="t m111 x61 h24 y107 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">stumbled to his feet and left the room as quickly as possible. Some of his </div><div class="t m112 x61 h24 y108 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">friends gasped in surprise. He never had been more humiliated. </div><div class="t m113 x73 h24 y109 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">That afternoon the young man learned that both the librarian and the </div><div class="t m114 x61 h24 y10a ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">professor were jolted to think that he was the guilty party. That made </div><div class="t m115 x61 h24 y10b ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">going to them for forgiveness even harder. First, he visited the librarian, </div><div class="t m116 x61 h24 y10c ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">who expressed his disappointment and then told him that he hoped the </div><div class="t m117 x61 h24 y10d ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">young man had learned something. Next, he visited the chairman of the </div><div class="t m118 x61 h24 y10e ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">religion department, the teacher of the class. They talked for over an </div><div class="t m119 x61 h24 y10f ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">hour. The professor was patient and understanding. The theology student </div><div class="t m11a x61 h24 y110 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">felt forgiven but, of course, could not undo what had happened. </div><div class="t m74 x74 h24 y111 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Ours is a world of sin and brokenness, of minor offenses as well as </div><div class="t m11b x63 h24 y112 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">major holocausts. If there is no forgiveness for what we have done and </div><div class="t m11c x61 h24 y113 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">still do, there is no hope. Christ came to reveal the power of divine for-</div><div class="t m11d x61 h24 y114 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">giveness to usâ€”to teach us how to be forgiven, and to forgive. </div><div class="t m11e x74 h24 y115 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Beyond Christ&apos;s forgiveness God has provided a means of reclaiming </div><div class="t m11f x63 h24 y116 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">us from sin. God&apos;s love did not stop at Calvary. Because of what was </div><div class="t m120 x63 h24 y117 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">accomplished there, He reaches beyond to transform the hearts and lives </div><div class="t m121 x63 h24 y118 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of the truly penitent and to enable them to follow Him along the pathway </div><div class="t mfe x63 h24 y119 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of obedience. </div><div class="t m122 x52 h25 y11a ff6 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">5 </div></div><div class="pi" data-data='{"ctm":[1.000000,0.000000,0.000000,1.000000,0.000000,0.000000]}'></div></div>
