Life was hard, but Galina developed a </div><div class="t m38f x4f hd y3e1 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">close walk with Jesus. He sustained her through this difficult time. </div><div class="t m65 x9e hd y3e2 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Galina lives near Irkutsk, on the southern tip of Lake Baikal, in </div><div class="t m390 x4f hd y3e3 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">south central Siberia.

The city of Cheremhovo </div><div class="t m395 x4f hd y3e8 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and the region surrounding it were almost empty of believers. Some-</div><div class="t m396 x4f hd y3e9 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">one should share the gospel with the people in this region. </div><div class="t m397 x9e hd y3ea ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Galina stepped out in faith and took a year&apos;s leave from her work. </div><div class="t m398 x4f hd y3eb ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">She packed up her few belongings and went to Cheremhovo. She </div><div class="t m399 x4f hd y3ec ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">found a place to live then visited the city manager&apos;s office to secure a </div><div class="t m39a x4f hd y3ed ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">permit to be a missionary in the city. With her permission document </div><div class="t m39b x4f hd y3ee ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in hand, Galina began visiting schools, orphanages, and factories, </div><div class="t m369 x4f hd y3ef ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">offering to give a spiritual message to the students and employees. </div><div class="t mc8 x4f hd y3f0 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">She sold Christian literature to earn a living as she searched for </div><div class="t m39c x64 hd y3f1 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">honest souls who were interested in spiritual matters.
