Soon after my baptism I began having Sabbath </div><div class="t m6bd x21 ha y36d ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">problems, and I could not complete one of my classes; I would have to </div><div class="t m385 x21 ha y57a ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">take the class again the next year. </div><div class="t m28a x1 ha y36f ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">My parents were upset that I had let my faith get in the way of my stud-</div><div class="t m580 x21 ha y370 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ies, and they refused to pay my school fees after that. But I was determined </div><div class="t m6ab x21 ha y4e6 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to return to school and show my parents that my faith had not made me </div><div class="t m29b x9c ha y9a5 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">fail. The Lord blessed me, and I remained in school even without my par-</div><div class="t m55d x21 ha y4e8 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ents&apos; support. </div><div class="t m821 x61 ha ya9a ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">As final exams approached, I prayed that God would help me do well </div><div class="t m2be x9c ha y4ea ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and bring glory to His name. But just before exams the faculty went on </div><div class="t m720 x9c ha ya9b ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">strike and school closed. Some weeks later we were called back to take our </div><div class="t m604 x9c ha y4eb ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">exams. </div><div class="t m694 x61 ha y6e4 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The exam schedule indicated that my exams began on Tuesday, so I </div><div class="t m7c5 x9c ha y4ec ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">spent Monday reviewing.

To my dismay, I learned </div><div class="t m216 x9c ha y377 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that the exam schedule had been revised after I had checked it.
