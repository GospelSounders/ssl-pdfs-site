But instead of a welcome, the villagers told the two </div><div class="t m459 x24 h1f yb22 ff3 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">pastors to leave. However the mission plane had already left and </div><div class="t m1ea x24 h1f y638 ff3 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">would not return for five days. After praying for God&apos;s guidance, </div><div class="t m3d5 x24 h1f y63a ff3 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Pastor Nick spoke to the shouting crowd. &quot;I&apos;m sorry that our </div><div class="t m4b1 x24 h1f y606 ff3 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">coming has upset you,&quot; he said. &quot;We don&apos;t know what to do.
