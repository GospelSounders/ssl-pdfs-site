But instead of a welcome, the villagers told the two </div><div class="t m459 x25 h23 yb23 ff3 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">pastors to leave. However the mission plane had already left and </div><div class="t m1ea x25 h23 y639 ff3 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">would not return for five days. After praying for God&apos;s guidance, </div><div class="t m3d5 x25 h23 y63b ff3 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Pastor Nick spoke to the shouting crowd. &quot;I&apos;m sorry that our </div><div class="t m4b1 x25 h23 y607 ff3 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">coming has upset you,&quot; he said. &quot;We don&apos;t know what to do.
