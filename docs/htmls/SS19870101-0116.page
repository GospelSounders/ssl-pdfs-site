None of us have </div><div class="t m202 x5a h1e y226 ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">reason to complain about our lot.

Of course God is just, but in this lesson we want </div><div class="t m13e x5a h1e y22b ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to take a close look at His justice. </div><div class="t m111 x55 h1f y22c ff1 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">1. </div><div class="t m1c0 x7b h1f y22d ff1 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Hezekiah&apos;s Mistake (2 Kings 20). </div><div class="t m205 x55 h1e y22e ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Hezekiah was sick and about to die. Isaiah the prophet told him to set his </div><div class="t m113 x5c h1e y22f ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">house in order because death was imminent. Hezekiah prayed earnestly that his </div><div class="t m206 x5c h1e y230 ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">life might be spared, and it was. </div><div class="t m207 x5c h1f y14a ff1 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">THINK IT THROUGH: Why did God tell Hezekiah that he was going to die </div><div class="t m208 x5c h1f y231 ff1 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">(verse 1), and then give him an extension of fifteen years of life (verse 6)? </div><div class="t m209 x5c h1f y232 ff1 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Was it to teach us something? Was it to point out that we ought to accept </div><div class="t m20a x5c h1f y233 ff1 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">God&apos;s providences and not seek to change them? </div><div class="t m20b x52 h1e y234 ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Whatever answers you give to these questions, it is interesting to note that the </div><div class="t m20c x5c h1e y235 ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">healing was confirmed by a sign that involved the sunâ€”or, perhaps technically, </div><div class="t m1b6 x5c h1e y236 ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the rotation of the earth. Apparently the Babylonian observers of this remarkable </div><div class="t m20d x5c h1e y8d ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sign made inquiries and learned that what they had observed had to do with the </div><div class="t m12c x5c h1e y1a7 ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">healing of the King of Judah. A delegation came to make inquiries. (See verse </div><div class="t m6a x5c h1e y237 ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">12.) </div><div class="t m20e x55 h1f y238 ff1 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Instead of giving God the glory for his marvelous healing, what did Hez-</div><div class="t m20f x5c h1f y239 ff1 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ekiah do? Verse 13. Why do you think he responded that way? </div><div class="t m1b4 x52 h1e y23a ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">God gives us opportunities to tell others of His providences. When we fail to </div><div class="t m158 x5c h1e y23b ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">do so, we are failing in accomplishing God&apos;s purposes in and through us. This is </div><div class="t m13c x5c h1e y23c ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">a serious failure, and we should pray that we never disappoint God in this way. </div><div class="t m13c x5c h1e y23d ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Hezekiah received a strong rebuke through the prophet Isaiah. He was told that </div><div class="t mf5 x5c h1e y15b ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">as a result of his action and inaction the time would come when the king of Judah </div><div class="t m120 x5c h1e y23e ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">would lose his wealth and influence. Some of Hezekiah&apos;s descendants would be </div><div class="t m1b3 x5c h1e y23f ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">taken captive to Babylon.

It demonstrates a relationship between what Hezekiah did and what </div><div class="t m171 x30 h1e y243 ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">actually happened. Every act has its consequences, for good or ill. Hezekiah had </div><div class="t m154 x5c h1e y244 ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">revealed his treasures of wealth but not the treasures of grace for which God was </div><div class="t me0 x5c h1e y245 ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">responsible and which were of greater worth than anything this world can offer. </div><div class="t m112 x21 h1f ya0 ff1 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">2. </div><div class="t m113 x46 h1f y246 ff1 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Manasseh&apos;s Crimes (2 Kings 21; 2 Chron. </div><div class="t m213 x8 h1e y247 ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">33). </div><div class="t m214 x21 h1e y248 ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Hezekiah undoubtedly was relieved to know that, at least in his own time, </div><div class="t m215 x30 h1f y249 ff1 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">there </div><div class="t m70 x46 h1e y24a ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">would be peace and security.
