None of us have </div><div class="t m202 x5b h1c y225 ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">reason to complain about our lot. Instead, all of us have every reason to thank </div><div class="t m203 x5d h1c y226 ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">God for His providences. </div><div class="t m65 x5b h1d y227 ff1 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I. JUSTICE. </div><div class="t m1be x56 h1c y228 ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Abraham once asked the rhetorical question: &quot;Shall not the Judge of all the </div><div class="t m204 x5b h1c y229 ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">earth do right?&quot; (Gen. 18:25). Of course God is just, but in this lesson we want </div><div class="t m13e x5b h1c y22a ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to take a close look at His justice. </div><div class="t m111 x56 h1d y22b ff1 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">1. </div><div class="t m1c0 x7c h1d y22c ff1 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Hezekiah&apos;s Mistake (2 Kings 20). </div><div class="t m205 x56 h1c y22d ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Hezekiah was sick and about to die. Isaiah the prophet told him to set his </div><div class="t m113 x5d h1c y22e ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">house in order because death was imminent. Hezekiah prayed earnestly that his </div><div class="t m206 x5d h1c y22f ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">life might be spared, and it was. </div><div class="t m207 x5d h1d y149 ff1 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">THINK IT THROUGH: Why did God tell Hezekiah that he was going to die </div><div class="t m208 x5d h1d y230 ff1 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">(verse 1), and then give him an extension of fifteen years of life (verse 6)? </div><div class="t m209 x5d h1d y231 ff1 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Was it to teach us something? Was it to point out that we ought to accept </div><div class="t m20a x5d h1d y232 ff1 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">God&apos;s providences and not seek to change them? </div><div class="t m20b x53 h1c y233 ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Whatever answers you give to these questions, it is interesting to note that the </div><div class="t m20c x5d h1c y234 ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">healing was confirmed by a sign that involved the sunâ€”or, perhaps technically, </div><div class="t m1b6 x5d h1c y235 ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the rotation of the earth. Apparently the Babylonian observers of this remarkable </div><div class="t m20d x5d h1c y8c ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sign made inquiries and learned that what they had observed had to do with the </div><div class="t m12c x5d h1c y1a6 ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">healing of the King of Judah. A delegation came to make inquiries. (See verse </div><div class="t m6a x5d h1c y236 ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">12.) </div><div class="t m20e x56 h1d y237 ff1 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Instead of giving God the glory for his marvelous healing, what did Hez-</div><div class="t m20f x5d h1d y238 ff1 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ekiah do? Verse 13. Why do you think he responded that way? </div><div class="t m1b4 x53 h1c y239 ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">God gives us opportunities to tell others of His providences. When we fail to </div><div class="t m158 x5d h1c y23a ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">do so, we are failing in accomplishing God&apos;s purposes in and through us. This is </div><div class="t m13c x5d h1c y23b ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">a serious failure, and we should pray that we never disappoint God in this way. </div><div class="t m13c x5d h1c y23c ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Hezekiah received a strong rebuke through the prophet Isaiah. He was told that </div><div class="t mf5 x5d h1c y15a ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">as a result of his action and inaction the time would come when the king of Judah </div><div class="t m120 x5d h1c y23d ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">would lose his wealth and influence. Some of Hezekiah&apos;s descendants would be </div><div class="t m1b3 x5d h1c y23e ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">taken captive to Babylon. Some would become &quot;eunuchs in the palace of the </div><div class="t m210 x5d h1c y23f ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">king of Babylon&quot; (verse 18). </div><div class="t m211 x53 h1c y240 ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">This prediction was made nearly a hundred years before the actual exile and </div><div class="t m212 x2f h1c y241 ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">captivity. It demonstrates a relationship between what Hezekiah did and what </div><div class="t m171 x2f h1c y242 ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">actually happened. Every act has its consequences, for good or ill. Hezekiah had </div><div class="t m154 x5d h1c y243 ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">revealed his treasures of wealth but not the treasures of grace for which God was </div><div class="t me0 x5d h1c y244 ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">responsible and which were of greater worth than anything this world can offer. </div><div class="t m112 x20 h1d y9f ff1 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">2. </div><div class="t m113 x47 h1d y245 ff1 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Manasseh&apos;s Crimes (2 Kings 21; 2 Chron. </div><div class="t m213 x7 h1c y246 ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">33). </div><div class="t m214 x20 h1c y247 ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Hezekiah undoubtedly was relieved to know that, at least in his own time, </div><div class="t m215 x2f h1d y248 ff1 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">there </div><div class="t m70 x47 h1c y249 ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">would be peace and security.
