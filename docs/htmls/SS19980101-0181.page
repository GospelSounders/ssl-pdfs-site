He had seen some of them working on a road </div><div class="t m2ee xc h1c y8f5 ff5 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and others helping his neighbor with his crop. He had heard that </div><div class="t m816 xc h1c y8f6 ff5 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">they were clearing wells—and even washing clothes and cooking </div><div class="t m2ef xc h1c y8f7 ff5 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">meals for old people. He wondered why these young people were </div><div class="t m817 xc h1c y8f8 ff5 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">working so hard for people they did not know. Then he learned </div><div class="t m410 xc h1c y8f9 ff5 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that they were building a mud-and-wattle church in the village. So </div><div class="t m16a xc h1c y8fa ff5 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that was it! They were trying to convert people! Well, he thought, </div><div class="t m818 xc h1c y8fb ff5 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">they weren&apos;t going to convert </div><div class="t m76 xe0 h1c y8fb ff7 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">him! </div><div class="t m1e3 x2 h1c y8fc ff5 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">One evening Thomas heard singing from the direction of the </div><div class="t m819 xc h1c y60b ff5 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">new church. He saw people walking toward the building and </div><div class="t m26 xc h1c y461 ff5 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">wondered if the young people were going to start preaching now. </div><div class="t m6dd x2d h1c y681 ff5 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">He was not interested in religion; he found comfort in his bottle of </div><div class="t m6cf x2d h1c y8fd ff7 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">waragi, </div><div class="t m96 x2c h1c y8fd ff5 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Ugandan beer. But by the second week of meetings, Tho-</div><div class="t m81a x2d h1c y8fe ff5 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">mas decided to go to the church and investigate. And if the preacher </div><div class="t m18e x2d h1c y8ff ff5 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">said something about his drinking, he would start an argument. He </div><div class="t m81b x2d h1c y900 ff5 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">fortified his resolve with plenty of </div><div class="t m314 xbb h1c y900 ff7 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">waragi, </div><div class="t m1b4 x85 h1c y901 ff5 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and tucked a spare </div><div class="t m81c x2d h1c y902 ff5 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">bottle into his old bag. Then he staggered into the meeting. </div><div class="t m2bc x22 h1c ya7 ff5 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">An usher seated Thomas up front, but Thomas was so drunk he </div><div class="t m6a3 x2d h1c y903 ff5 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">fell asleep, waking only when the youth sang the closing song. The </div><div class="t m81d x2d h1c y904 ff5 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">next evening he came again, still intending to argue with the </div><div class="t m421 x2d h1c y905 ff5 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">preacher. He was not so drunk, and did not fall asleep, but the </div><div class="t m198 x2d h1c y38f ff5 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">meeting ended before he could interject his opinion. He continued </div><div class="t m16a x2d h1c y390 ff5 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">attending the meetings, but each night he was a little more sober. </div><div class="t med x22 h1c y1ab ff5 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">One night the speaker appealed for those who wanted to follow </div><div class="t m362 x2d h1c y906 ff5 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Jesus to stand. Several people responded, including Thomas. When </div><div class="t m454 x4f h1c y907 ff5 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the preacher called for believers to keep the Sabbath and be bap-</div><div class="t m393 x4f h1c y908 ff5 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tized, Thomas again responded. By now he was sober. He began </div><div class="t m16a x2d h1c y909 ff5 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">studying the Bible and was baptized with 100 others. </div><div class="t m69c x22 h1c y90a ff5 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Now, instead of arguing with the preacher, Thomas is helping to </div><div class="t m96 x4f h1c y90b ff5 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">build a permanent church. The believers have made burned bricks </div><div class="t m6b1 x4f h1c y90c ff5 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">for the walls, but they have no money for sand or cement for mortar, </div><div class="t m3cc x4f h1c y90d ff5 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">or for timber or iron sheets for the roof. Pray that God will supply </div><div class="t m331 x4f h1c y90e ff5 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">their needs as they seek to reach out to others with God&apos;s love. </div><div class="t mab x22 h16 y6aa ff3 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Christian Aliddeki is president of the Uganda Union in Eastern Africa </div><div class="t m714 x4f h16 y792 ff3 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Division. </div><div class="t m714 xe1 hb y90f ff4 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0"><span class="fc0 sc0"> </span></div><div class="t m81e x35 h54 y910 ff5 fs20 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">PrOd </div><div class="t m81f xd3 h55 y910 ff5 fs1b fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">IC</div><div class="t m820 x2c h55 y910 ff5 fs1b fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">1</div><div class="t m821 x84 h55 y910 ff5 fs1b fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">/</div><div class="t m822 x84 h55 y910 ff5 fs1b fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">4</div><div class="t m569 x7d h54 y910 ff5 fs20 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">2(.1 h \ lhC </div><div class="t m437 xae h55 y910 ff5 fs1b fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ICIILT;11 </div><div class="t ma x54 h55 y910 ff5 fs1b fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0"></div><div class="t m823 x7b h55 y910 ff5 fs1b fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">011CCIVI1CC )111CC </div><div class="t ma x25 h55 y910 ff5 fs1b fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0"></div><div class="t m824 x5f h55 y910 ff5 fs1b fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">11</div><div class="t m825 x12 h55 y910 ff5 fs1b fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">,</div><div class="t m186 x32 h55 y910 ff5 fs1b fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">,:•1011 </div><div class="t ma xa1 h55 y910 ff5 fs1b fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0"></div><div class="t m826 x56 h55 y910 ff5 fs1b fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">\ </div><div class="t ma xe h55 y910 ff5 fs1b fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0"></div><div class="t m827 x75 h55 y910 ff5 fs1b fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">CI1C </div><div class="t m827 xe1 hb y911 ff4 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0"><span class="fc0 sc0"> </span></div></div><div class="pi" data-data='{"ctm":[1.000000,0.000000,0.000000,1.000000,0.000000,0.000000]}'></div></div>
