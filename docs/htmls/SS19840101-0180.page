He had a plan for this &quot;giant&quot;; He </div><div class="t m62e x2d h1f y8fb ff5 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">loved him. The enemy&apos;s intentions surely were clear to Samson. On a </div><div class="t m1b8 x2d h1f y8fc ff5 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">previous occasion his own people, in fear, had bound him and delivered </div><div class="t m26b x2d h1f y8fd ff5 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">him to enemy lines. Through the Spirit&apos;s power he had then broken the </div><div class="t m50d x2d h1f y1a ff5 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">cords, escaped, and inflicted heavy casualties among the Philistines.

But at midnight he broke down the city gate </div><div class="t m112 x2d h1f y62d ff5 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and took it with him (Judges 16:3). Artists love to depict Samson, in this </div><div class="t m348 x2d h1f y73 ff5 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">display of superhuman strength, carrying the heavy weight.
