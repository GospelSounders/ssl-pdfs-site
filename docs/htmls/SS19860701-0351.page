Last week&apos;s study of John 3:16 reminded us again that </div><div class="t m5fa x33 h16 y80f ff5 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the life He brings is everlasting or eternal life. Even though our limited </div><div class="t m5fb x33 h16 y810 ff5 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">minds may be unable to comprehend fully how long &quot;eternity&quot; is, the </div><div class="t m5fc x33 h16 y811 ff5 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Lord still wants us to appreciate as much as we can how exceedingly </div><div class="t m5fd x80 h16 y812 ff5 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">valuable the gift of eternal life is. </div><div class="t m5a5 x47 h16 y813 ff5 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">We also need to appreciate the difference between the idea of eternal </div><div class="t m3f x80 h16 y814 ff5 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">life and mere eternal existence. To exist forever would be no blessing at </div><div class="t m549 x80 h16 y815 ff5 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">all if that eternity were one of boredom, loneliness, unsatisfied yearnings, </div><div class="t m69 x80 h16 y816 ff5 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and constant battles with sin and self. </div><div class="t m5fe x71 h16 y817 ff5 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">But the eternal life that Jesus offers us is unlimited, not only in quantity </div><div class="t m59c x80 h16 y5b0 ff5 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">but in quality.
