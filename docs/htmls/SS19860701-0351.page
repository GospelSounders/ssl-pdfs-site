When we stud-</div><div class="t m5f9 x32 h13 y80c ff5 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ied John 1, we learned that this Jesus, who has no beginning, brings each </div><div class="t m3af x32 h13 y80d ff5 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of us the gift of life. Last week&apos;s study of John 3:16 reminded us again that </div><div class="t m5fa x32 h13 y80e ff5 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the life He brings is everlasting or eternal life. Even though our limited </div><div class="t m5fb x32 h13 y80f ff5 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">minds may be unable to comprehend fully how long &quot;eternity&quot; is, the </div><div class="t m5fc x32 h13 y810 ff5 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Lord still wants us to appreciate as much as we can how exceedingly </div><div class="t m5fd x80 h13 y811 ff5 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">valuable the gift of eternal life is. </div><div class="t m5a5 x46 h13 y812 ff5 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">We also need to appreciate the difference between the idea of eternal </div><div class="t m3f x80 h13 y813 ff5 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">life and mere eternal existence. To exist forever would be no blessing at </div><div class="t m549 x80 h13 y814 ff5 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">all if that eternity were one of boredom, loneliness, unsatisfied yearnings, </div><div class="t m69 x80 h13 y815 ff5 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and constant battles with sin and self. </div><div class="t m5fe x70 h13 y816 ff5 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">But the eternal life that Jesus offers us is unlimited, not only in quantity </div><div class="t m59c x80 h13 y5af ff5 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">but in quality.

Best of all, the greatest reward </div><div class="t mb2 x80 h13 y819 ff5 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of eternal life is the privilege of intimate companionship with the three </div><div class="t m5ff x80 h13 y81a ff5 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Persons of the Godhead. </div><div class="t m599 x70 h13 y81b ff5 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Some of the best news that John shares with us is that eternal life is not </div><div class="t m164 x80 h13 y81c ff5 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">something we must wait until the return of Jesus to experience.
