Lynn Martell </div><div class="t m67c x4f h20 yb97 ff3 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Carolyn put the telephone receiver back on the hook. Her </div><div class="t m38d x79 h20 y148 ff3 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">mother&apos;s words still rang in her ear: Her father had been strug-</div><div class="t m412 x79 h20 yb98 ff3 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">gling with cancer and emphysema, but he was losing the battle. </div><div class="t m2bd x79 h20 yb99 ff3 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Could she come right away? </div><div class="t m113 x4f h20 yb9a ff3 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Although Carolyn had beenreared in a Christian home, both </div><div class="t m22d x79 h20 yb9b ff3 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">she and her family had strayed from their faith. Now, when death </div><div class="t m5e2 x79 h20 yb9c ff3 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">seemed imminent, she did not know what to say to give her father </div><div class="t m55 x79 h20 y9df ff3 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">hope--or to shore up her own faith. Realizing that she did not </div><div class="t m439 x79 h20 yb9d ff3 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">know God as she should, she spent time fasting and praying, </div><div class="t m77 x79 h20 yb9e ff3 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">asking God for spiritual restoration to enable her to comfort and </div><div class="t m386 x79 h20 y9e1 ff3 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">help her father. </div><div class="t mb5 x4f h20 y197 ff3 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">God came near to her, giving her the assurance of His love and </div><div class="t m3b3 x79 h20 y198 ff3 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">acceptance. With new hope she traveled to the island of Hawaii, </div><div class="t m255 x6 h20 yb9f ff3 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">where her parents lived. She spent an entire night reading the </div><div class="t m12f x6 h20 y3fe ff3 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Bible to her father and talking to him about salvation. He renewed </div><div class="t m245 x79 h20 y19c ff3 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">his faith in Christ and accepted Jesus as his Saviour just before he </div><div class="t m2ac x79 h20 yba0 ff3 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">died. </div><div class="t m49f xd h20 y19e ff3 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">After the funeral Carolyn returned home and continued to </div><div class="t m1a7 x6 h20 y65d ff3 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">nurture her new relationship with God. She began searching for a </div><div class="t m2bd x6 h20 y1a1 ff3 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">church that would meet her spiritual needs. She attended several </div><div class="t m380 x6 h20 y347 ff3 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">churches, but was not satisfied with any of them. </div><div class="t m1cc xd h20 y1a3 ff3 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">One day her husband, Taeleipu (Ipu, for short), a post-office </div><div class="t m4b7 x6 h20 y348 ff3 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">worker, noticed a brochure for the Discoveries in Prophecy semi-</div><div class="t m184 x6 h20 y349 ff3 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">nars as he sorted mail. As a child he had known some Adventists </div><div class="t m1ab x6 h20 y1a5 ff3 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in his homeland of Samoa. Although he also had a Christian </div><div class="t m3b7 x6 h20 y9bc ff3 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">background, he no longer attended church. But he knew his wife </div><div class="t m5f6 x6 h20 y813 ff3 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was searching, and brought one of the brochures home for her. </div><div class="t m3ce x6 h20 y814 ff3 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">When she lost it, he found another one in the trash at work. This </div><div class="t m18c x6 h20 yba1 ff3 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">time he suggested that she attend. He even offered to care for the </div><div class="t m317 x6 h20 y815 ff3 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">children so she could go. </div><div class="t m22e xd h20 y816 ff3 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Carolyn began attending the meetings. After each meeting she </div><div class="t m410 x6 h20 y1a9 ff3 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">shared what she had learned with her husband. He listened and </div><div class="t m172 x6 h20 y9c1 ff3 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">willingly accepted each truth. </div><div class="t m38c xd h20 y9e7 ff3 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">When Ipu needed surgery, members of the Adventist church </div><div class="t m136 x6 h20 y7b5 ff3 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">visited him in the hospital. Their caring attitude deeply impressed </div><div class="t m4fc x6 h20 yba2 ff3 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">him. Ipu decided that the Adventist faith must be real, and decided </div><div class="t m19e x6 h20 yba3 ff3 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to attend church and be baptized. Today Ipu and Carolyn rejoice </div><div class="t m14d x6 h20 yba4 ff3 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in their new walk with God, forged in the face of death. </div><div class="t m5a0 xd h20 yba5 ff3 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">J.
