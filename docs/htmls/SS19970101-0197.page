Lynn Martell </div><div class="t m67c x4e h1d yb96 ff3 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Carolyn put the telephone receiver back on the hook. Her </div><div class="t m38d x78 h1d y147 ff3 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">mother&apos;s words still rang in her ear: Her father had been strug-</div><div class="t m412 x78 h1d yb97 ff3 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">gling with cancer and emphysema, but he was losing the battle. </div><div class="t m2bd x78 h1d yb98 ff3 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Could she come right away? </div><div class="t m113 x4e h1d yb99 ff3 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Although Carolyn had beenreared in a Christian home, both </div><div class="t m22d x78 h1d yb9a ff3 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">she and her family had strayed from their faith. Now, when death </div><div class="t m5e2 x78 h1d yb9b ff3 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">seemed imminent, she did not know what to say to give her father </div><div class="t m55 x78 h1d y9de ff3 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">hope--or to shore up her own faith. Realizing that she did not </div><div class="t m439 x78 h1d yb9c ff3 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">know God as she should, she spent time fasting and praying, </div><div class="t m77 x78 h1d yb9d ff3 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">asking God for spiritual restoration to enable her to comfort and </div><div class="t m386 x78 h1d y9e0 ff3 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">help her father. </div><div class="t mb5 x4e h1d y196 ff3 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">God came near to her, giving her the assurance of His love and </div><div class="t m3b3 x78 h1d y197 ff3 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">acceptance. With new hope she traveled to the island of Hawaii, </div><div class="t m255 x5 h1d yb9e ff3 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">where her parents lived. She spent an entire night reading the </div><div class="t m12f x5 h1d y3fd ff3 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Bible to her father and talking to him about salvation. He renewed </div><div class="t m245 x78 h1d y19b ff3 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">his faith in Christ and accepted Jesus as his Saviour just before he </div><div class="t m2ac x78 h1d yb9f ff3 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">died. </div><div class="t m49f xc h1d y19d ff3 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">After the funeral Carolyn returned home and continued to </div><div class="t m1a7 x5 h1d y65c ff3 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">nurture her new relationship with God. She began searching for a </div><div class="t m2bd x5 h1d y1a0 ff3 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">church that would meet her spiritual needs. She attended several </div><div class="t m380 x5 h1d y346 ff3 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">churches, but was not satisfied with any of them. </div><div class="t m1cc xc h1d y1a2 ff3 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">One day her husband, Taeleipu (Ipu, for short), a post-office </div><div class="t m4b7 x5 h1d y347 ff3 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">worker, noticed a brochure for the Discoveries in Prophecy semi-</div><div class="t m184 x5 h1d y348 ff3 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">nars as he sorted mail. As a child he had known some Adventists </div><div class="t m1ab x5 h1d y1a4 ff3 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in his homeland of Samoa. Although he also had a Christian </div><div class="t m3b7 x5 h1d y9bb ff3 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">background, he no longer attended church. But he knew his wife </div><div class="t m5f6 x5 h1d y812 ff3 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was searching, and brought one of the brochures home for her. </div><div class="t m3ce x5 h1d y813 ff3 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">When she lost it, he found another one in the trash at work. This </div><div class="t m18c x5 h1d yba0 ff3 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">time he suggested that she attend. He even offered to care for the </div><div class="t m317 x5 h1d y814 ff3 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">children so she could go. </div><div class="t m22e xc h1d y815 ff3 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Carolyn began attending the meetings. After each meeting she </div><div class="t m410 x5 h1d y1a8 ff3 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">shared what she had learned with her husband. He listened and </div><div class="t m172 x5 h1d y9c0 ff3 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">willingly accepted each truth. </div><div class="t m38c xc h1d y9e6 ff3 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">When Ipu needed surgery, members of the Adventist church </div><div class="t m136 x5 h1d y7b4 ff3 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">visited him in the hospital. Their caring attitude deeply impressed </div><div class="t m4fc x5 h1d yba1 ff3 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">him. Ipu decided that the Adventist faith must be real, and decided </div><div class="t m19e x5 h1d yba2 ff3 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to attend church and be baptized. Today Ipu and Carolyn rejoice </div><div class="t m14d x5 h1d yba3 ff3 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in their new walk with God, forged in the face of death. </div><div class="t m5a0 xc h1d yba4 ff3 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">J.
