Ps. 27:10. </div><div class="t m154 x43 h23 y923 ff4 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Have you noticed how the psalmist expressed a deeply felt need and </div><div class="t m324 x41 h23 y924 ff4 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">then immediately expressed a strong faith and trust in God? He knew that </div><div class="t m242 x41 h23 y925 ff4 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">even if mother or father should forsake him, God would give support. We </div><div class="t m1a8 x41 h23 y372 ff4 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">need to develop the habit of countering doubt with faith, fear with trust, </div><div class="t m471 x41 h23 y373 ff4 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">uncertainty with confidence.

He recognized </div><div class="t m80 x3 h23 y928 ff4 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">his need to be taught and led. So many of us are self-confident.
