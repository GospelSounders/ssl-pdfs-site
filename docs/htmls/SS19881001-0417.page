The </div><div class="t m22a x7 ha y24f ff4 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">great descent of Christ from God to man is given in Philippians 2:5-8. The </div><div class="t m152 x12 ha y250 ff4 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ultimate humility is revealed in the words &quot;He humbled himself by living a </div><div class="t m22b x12 ha y251 ff4 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">life of utter obedience, to the point of death, and the death He died was the </div><div class="t m22c x12 ha y252 ff4 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">death of a common criminal&quot; (verse 8, Phillips). </div><div class="t m218 x3a ha y253 ff4 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Think of the emotions that must have surged through Judas&apos; mind as Jesus </div><div class="t m22d x12 ha y254 ff4 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">washed his feet. For thirty pieces of silver Judas was about to hand Jesus </div><div class="t m22e x12 ha y255 ff4 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">over to the Jewish authorities. Nevertheless, the Messiah, who knew what </div><div class="t m22f x12 ha y256 ff4 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Judas had done, instead of exposing him, stooped to wash his feet. The </div><div class="t m230 x12 ha y257 ff4 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">power of Christ&apos;s love brought powerful conviction for Judas to confess his </div><div class="t m231 x12 ha y19d ff4 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sin. Tragically he rejected it. In his estimation, no one who would adopt the </div><div class="t mdd x12 ha y258 ff4 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">position of an unimportant servant was worthy of his adoration. He deter-</div><div class="t m232 x12 ha y259 ff4 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">mined to go through with his plan to betray Jesus and thereby lost eternal </div><div class="t m233 x12 ha y25a ff4 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">life. </div><div class="t m18f x3a ha y25b ff4 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Peter&apos;s reaction was different. He was overwhelmed by His Lord&apos;s bend-</div><div class="t m1f5 x12 ha y1a0 ff4 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ing so low as to wash his feet. He was ashamed that he was not doing what </div><div class="t m149 x12 ha y25c ff4 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Jesus was doing. He sensed that his personal pride had kept him from being </div><div class="t m234 x12 ha y25d ff4 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">a servant.

This was of far more conse-</div><div class="t m23f x12 ha y36 ff4 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">quence than the washing of their dusty feet. With the spirit they then had, </div><div class="t m1ff x2 ha ydb ff4 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">not one of them was prepared for communion with Christ. Until brought into </div><div class="t mb9 x12 ha y268 ff4 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">a state of humility and love, they were not prepared to partake of the paschal </div><div class="t m240 x2 ha yde ff4 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">supper, or to share in the memorial service which Christ was about to insti-</div><div class="t m241 x2 ha y70 ff4 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tute.
