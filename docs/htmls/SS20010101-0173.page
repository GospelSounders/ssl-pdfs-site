When John Kingston, a literature evange-</div><div class="t m381 x41 hf y614 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">list, visited her, Pat sensed his relationship with God and began </div><div class="t m606 x41 hf y7aa ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">asking him questions. She expressed her desire to know God, and </div><div class="t m72 x41 hf y616 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Kingston arranged for Pat to take Bible studies. </div><div class="t m546 x46 hf y617 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Then Pat&apos;s husband died suddenly. Pat was devastated, but she </div><div class="t m421 x41 hf y618 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">continued her Bible studies. However, Pat had an addiction to </div><div class="t m5fe x41 hf y7ab ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tobacco, and following her husband&apos;s death, her smoking increased. </div><div class="t md7 x46 hf y61a ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Pat moved to a small farm some distance away, but the peace </div><div class="t m16a x41 hf y61b ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">she sought eluded her. </div><div class="t m58b x46 hf y61c ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">One day an Adventist couple living near Pat received a phone </div><div class="t m7f x1d hf y61d ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">call alerting them to Pat&apos;s interest in spiritual matters. They visited </div><div class="t m234 x1d hf y61e ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Pat, and she resumed Bible studies. Eventually Pat was baptized. </div><div class="t m12a x46 hf y61f ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">But Pat had not gained complete victory over tobacco. She tried </div><div class="t m303 x41 hf y620 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to hide her habit from her friends, but the habit drove a wedge </div><div class="t m18b x1d hf y7ac ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">between her and God. Soon she stopped attending church and </div><div class="t m55e x1d hf y623 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">pretended to be away when church members came to visit. </div><div class="t m36b x1e hf y7ad ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Months passed; Pat tried everything she knew to win the battle </div><div class="t m315 x1d hf y7ae ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">over cigarettes. But the habit was stronger than her will. Her health </div><div class="t m619 x1d hf y6a7 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">began failing as her smoking increased to 150 cigarettes a day. </div><div class="t md9 x1d hf y7af ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Then she heard about the church&apos;s stop-smoking program and </div><div class="t m384 x1d hf y7b0 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">called to see if any sessions were being held in her area. None </div><div class="t m3d2 x1d hf y7b1 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">were. Pat asked for a &quot;stop-smoking-at-home&quot; kit. </div><div class="t m515 x1e hf y7b2 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">As Pat waited for the kit to arrive, she thought seriously about </div><div class="t m573 x1d hf y7b3 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">her relationship with God and her inability to stop smoking. She </div><div class="t m61a x1d hf y7b4 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">knew she needed to surrender her life fully to God before she could </div><div class="t m49b x1d hf y7b5 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">truly gain victory over cigarettes. When the stop-smoking kit ar-</div><div class="t m615 x1d hf y7b6 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">rived, Pat committed her problem to God and asked Him for the </div><div class="t m5a3 x1d hf y7b7 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">victory over tobacco and her will. With strength she received from </div><div class="t mc2 x1d hf y7b8 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">reading the Bible and the encouragement of a trusted Adventist </div><div class="t m72 x1d hf y7b9 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">friend, Pat started the stop-smoking plan. </div><div class="t m10c x1e hf y7ba ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">With God&apos;s help she won her freedom from tobacco.
