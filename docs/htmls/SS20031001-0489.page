She </div><div class="t m63c x6f h16 y241 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">hung her head as she listened to a list of Femando&apos;s latest misdeeds. </div><div class="t ma8 x6f h16 y242 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The story was all too familiar to her. The family lived in a poor </div><div class="t m63d x6f h16 y133 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">neighborhood with a lot of crime in southern Brazil. Lorene prayed </div><div class="t m63e x6f h16 y134 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">constantly for her son and was sure God had a plan for his life. </div><div class="t m477 x10 h16 y136 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Fernando seemed to find trouble. When he was 8 years old he </div><div class="t m465 x6f h16 y245 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">grabbed onto the back of a moving truck. The driver did not see the </div><div class="t m63f x1d h16 y138 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">boy, and as he sped around a corner, Fernando fell off. Someone found </div><div class="t m640 x6f h16 y139 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the boy lying beside the road and they took him to the hospital. </div><div class="t m1ae x10 h16 y400 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Fernando lay unconscious in intensive care for three days. The </div><div class="t m641 x1d h16 y13b ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">doctor told his mother that there was little chance for the boy to </div><div class="t m618 x1d h16 y401 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">recover. But Fernando&apos;s mother was not willing to give up on him. </div><div class="t m642 x1d h16 y5c9 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">She begged the doctor to give the boy more time to come out of the </div><div class="t m643 x1d h16 y13d ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">coma, and reluctantly the doctor agreed to give her one more day. </div><div class="t m644 x10 h16 y24a ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Lorene went into the bathroom and begged God to save her son. The </div><div class="t m645 x1d h16 y2c9 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">next day the doctor was surprised to find that Fernando was beginning to </div><div class="t m40a x1d h16 y24c ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">respond to touch. His reflexes were improving, and soon he awakened </div><div class="t m646 x1d h16 y140 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">from the coma. Soon after his recovery, Fernando returned home. But </div><div class="t m647 x1d h16 y24d ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">his life was not easy, and he needed constant medical care. </div><div class="t m1b2 x10 h16 y144 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Fernando caused problems in school, and often his mother was </div><div class="t m648 x1d h16 y382 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">called to the school to deal with him. His teachers sometimes said he </div><div class="t m55d x1d h16 y24e ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was a lost cause, but his mother refused to give up on him. Often she </div><div class="t m1f9 x1d h16 y513 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">reminded the boy of the miracles God had done in his life. </div><div class="t m649 x10 h16 y403 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">When Fernando was 13 years old a neighbor invited him to attend </div><div class="t m64a x8 h16 y4fa ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Pathfinders. He loved it and began attending regularly. As he attended, </div><div class="t m64b x8 h16 y405 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">his behavior began to change. He attended an evangelistic series and </div><div class="t m64c x8 h16 y4fb ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">asked his mother to allow him to be baptized. But his mother thought he </div><div class="t m64d x8 h16 y4fc ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was too young. Besides, the family attended another church. </div><div class="t m64e x10 h16 y4d1 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The night before the scheduled baptism, Lorene dreamed that Jesus </div><div class="t m194 x8 h16 y66 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was coming. She saw other people going to heaven, but she and </div><div class="t m46c x43 h16 y465 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Fernando remained on earth. When she awoke she realized that she </div><div class="t m1e7 x43 h16 y43d ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">must allow her son to be baptized. </div><div class="t m64f x2a h16 y43e ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Today Fernando is a faithful young member of the local church in </div><div class="t m459 x8 h16 y43f ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">southern Brazil. He no longer causes problems in school. Those who </div><div class="t m650 x43 h16 y420 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">thought he was a lost cause now are convinced that God has changed </div><div class="t m204 x43 h16 y440 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">him. His parents, who thought he was too young to decide for Christ, </div><div class="t m651 x43 h16 y196 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">now attend church and are preparing for baptism as well. </div><div class="t m652 x2a h16 y4d4 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Sonia Santos is </div><div class="t m234 x6a h2d y299 ff4 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">director of Women&apos;s and Children&apos;s Ministries in the </div><div class="t m653 x43 h2d y29a ff4 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Rio Grande do Sul mission in southern Brazil. </div><div class="t m555 x57 h2e y61c ff2 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Produced by the Office of Mission </div><div class="t m654 xaf h2e y7f7 ff2 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Sabbath School-Personal Ministries department of the General Conference </div><div class="t m1f4 x13 h2e y7f8 ff2 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Email: gomission@gc.adventist.org </div><div class="t m3f x72 h2e y7f9 ff2 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">î˜‰</div><div class="t m569 x86 h16 y355 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">87 </div></div><div class="pi" data-data='{"ctm":[1.000000,0.000000,0.000000,1.000000,0.000000,0.000000]}'></div></div>
