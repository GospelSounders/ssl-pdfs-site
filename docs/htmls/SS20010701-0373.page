We decided to buy a kerosene lamp to light these evening </div><div class="t m51b x52 h11 y803 ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">worships. The villagers enjoy sitting in the light of the lamp listening </div><div class="t m375 x52 h11 y804 ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to Bible stories. When the villagers learned that the light from the </div><div class="t m17 x1f h11 y805 ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">lamp can be seen in villages quite a distance away, they compared </div><div class="t m665 x52 h11 y806 ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">their lamp with the light of salvation that has come to their village. </div><div class="t m5e1 x5f h11 y807 ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">One night we discovered that we were out of kerosene. Villagers </div><div class="t m666 x1f h11 y808 ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">scampered home to bring what kerosene they had to fill the lamp. We </div><div class="t m667 x1f h11 y809 ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">pooled the kerosene and poured it into the lamp. It was not enough to </div><div class="t m668 x1f h11 y80a ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">keep the lamp burning for long, so we decided to shorten the evening </div><div class="t m669 x1f h11 y6e2 ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">worship. But during the lively worship we all forgot about the limited </div><div class="t m44d x1f h11 y80b ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">supply of kerosene. When worship ended we checked the lamp&apos;s fuel </div><div class="t m66a x1f h11 y80c ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tank and found it was empty. It was too far to walk to the nearest trader </div><div class="t m66b x1f h11 y80d ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">who had kerosene to sell, so we knew that we would have no kerosene </div><div class="t m66c x1f h11 y80e ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">for the next night&apos;s worship. </div><div class="t m66d x1b h11 y6e4 ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The next evening as we prepared for worship my partner checked </div><div class="t m66e x1f h11 y80f ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the lamp and found the tank was full! He asked me if I had found some </div><div class="t m66f x1f h11 y810 ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">kerosene, but I had not. We lighted the lamp and began worship. We </div><div class="t m607 x1f h11 y811 ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">told the villagers that our God had worked a miracle and provided </div><div class="t m3b3 x1f h11 y812 ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">kerosene to light our worship. We told the story of the widow who </div><div class="t m30c x1f h11 y813 ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">borrowed vessels to fill with oil, and the oil failed not until all the </div><div class="t m201 x1f h11 y814 ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">vessels were filled. We explained that this miracle occurred because </div><div class="t m18f x1f h11 y815 ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of the widow&apos;s faith and compared the story with the kerosene in our </div><div class="t m670 x11 h11 y816 ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">lamp. We had a wonderful worship, lighted by faith and kerosene. The </div><div class="t m5fc x11 h11 y817 ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">following evening we again inspected the lamp and found the tank </div><div class="t m671 x11 h11 y818 ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">full! This continued for three nights before we could purchase more </div><div class="t m672 x11 h11 y92 ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">kerosene. </div><div class="t m453 x1b h11 y93 ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The village chief summed up our miracle when, during one of our </div><div class="t m617 x11 h11 y819 ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">worships, he said, &quot;With our own eyes we have seen the miracle given </div><div class="t m673 x11 h11 y81a ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to us by the God in heaven. We need to be faithful to Him every day!&quot; </div><div class="t m5f8 x1b h11 y81b ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;We will be faithful!&quot; the villagers responded. </div><div class="t m17e x28 h2f y81c ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Rendy Sebilo was a student missionary in Lapangon in southern </div><div class="t m68 x11 h2f y6d8 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Philippines.
