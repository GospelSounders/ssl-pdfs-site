What is true for the father of the race is </div><div class="t m764 x67 h1e ycc0 ff5 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">true for all its members. Our fate, our destiny, is included in his. So Paul </div><div class="t m22 x67 h1e ycc1 ff5 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tells us that when one man (Adam) sinned and brought death into the </div><div class="t m1e6 x67 h1e ycc2 ff5 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">world, that death &quot;passed upon all men&quot; (Rom. 5:12). </div><div class="t m69c x17 h1e y51 ff5 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Sometimes when the first mountain climber on a rope falls, the climber </div><div class="t m3fa x67 h1e y52 ff5 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">takes the others tied to the rope down with him. When Adam fell, he took </div><div class="t m400 x67 h1e ycc3 ff5 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">us down with him. All of us came under the power of death when Adam </div><div class="t m4b x67 h1e ybc6 ff5 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">did. When he died, he was a prisoner of the grave. He was locked in.

Adam had no key to unlock his own grave. </div><div class="t m1f4 x67 h1e ycc5 ff5 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Somewhere it holds him still. </div><div class="t m2ea x17 h1e ycc6 ff5 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">We might well abandon hope and embrace despair if it were not for the </div><div class="t m408 x67 h1e ycc7 ff5 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">thrilling news that God shares with us in His Word.
