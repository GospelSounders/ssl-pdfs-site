What is true for the father of the race is </div><div class="t m764 x66 h1a ycbf ff5 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">true for all its members. Our fate, our destiny, is included in his. So Paul </div><div class="t m22 x66 h1a ycc0 ff5 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tells us that when one man (Adam) sinned and brought death into the </div><div class="t m1e6 x66 h1a ycc1 ff5 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">world, that death &quot;passed upon all men&quot; (Rom. 5:12). </div><div class="t m69c x16 h1a y50 ff5 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Sometimes when the first mountain climber on a rope falls, the climber </div><div class="t m3fa x66 h1a y51 ff5 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">takes the others tied to the rope down with him. When Adam fell, he took </div><div class="t m400 x66 h1a ycc2 ff5 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">us down with him. All of us came under the power of death when Adam </div><div class="t m4b x66 h1a ybc5 ff5 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">did. When he died, he was a prisoner of the grave. He was locked in. And </div><div class="t m816 x66 h1a ycc3 ff5 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">when we die, so are we. Adam had no key to unlock his own grave. </div><div class="t m1f4 x66 h1a ycc4 ff5 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Somewhere it holds him still. </div><div class="t m2ea x16 h1a ycc5 ff5 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">We might well abandon hope and embrace despair if it were not for the </div><div class="t m408 x66 h1a ycc6 ff5 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">thrilling news that God shares with us in His Word.

But God has sent a second Adam to </div><div class="t m49f x66 h1a yb95 ff5 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">attempt success where the first Adam failed. The second Adam gloriously </div><div class="t m70c x66 h1a ycc8 ff5 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">succeeded! </div><div class="t m3c5 x16 h1a ycc9 ff5 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">And now God gives each of us a choice.

Death is reduced to locking up its prisoners for a time until </div><div class="t m50 x66 h1a ycd4 ff5 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Jesus comes to set them free.
