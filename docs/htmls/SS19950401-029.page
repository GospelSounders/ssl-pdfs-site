However, Moses </div><div class="t mff x30 h19 y10f ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">knows him well, and is confident in his ability as leader and soldier. </div><div class="t m100 x30 h19 y110 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">From the first, Joshua is a successful warrior-general fighting the </div><div class="t m101 x30 h19 y111 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">battles of the Lord. Verse 14 also hints at the work God had in store </div><div class="t m102 x30 h19 y112 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">for him. God&apos;s promise to destroy utterly the Amalekites was to be </div><div class="t m103 x30 h19 y113 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">written in a book and recounted in the hearing, not of all Israel, but of </div><div class="t m104 x30 h19 y114 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Joshua.

Ex. 17:8-16; Joshua 6-8. How did Joshua show compas-</div><div class="t m106 x30 h19 y117 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sion? Joshua 6:22, 23. </div><div class="t m107 x10 h19 y118 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">In God&apos;s warfare, mercy takes precedence.

For 40 years (the time between Israel&apos;s depar-</div><div class="t m10a x30 h19 y11c ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ture from Egypt and their entrance into Canaan) these citizens had </div><div class="t m10b x30 h19 y11d ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">time to consider the nature of the true God and commit their lives to </div><div class="t m10c x30 h19 y11e ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Him. But only one family did so. Joshua&apos;s act of compassion tells us </div><div class="t m7c x30 h19 y11f ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that God delights more in salvation than in destruction. (See Eze. </div><div class="t m10d x3f h19 y120 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">18:21-23, 32.) </div><div class="t m10e x10 h19 y121 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">What was Joshua&apos;s ultimate source of power in battle?
