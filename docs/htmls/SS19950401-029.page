However, Moses </div><div class="t mff x31 h1d y110 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">knows him well, and is confident in his ability as leader and soldier. </div><div class="t m100 x31 h1d y111 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">From the first, Joshua is a successful warrior-general fighting the </div><div class="t m101 x31 h1d y112 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">battles of the Lord. Verse 14 also hints at the work God had in store </div><div class="t m102 x31 h1d y113 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">for him. God&apos;s promise to destroy utterly the Amalekites was to be </div><div class="t m103 x31 h1d y114 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">written in a book and recounted in the hearing, not of all Israel, but of </div><div class="t m104 x31 h1d y115 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Joshua.
