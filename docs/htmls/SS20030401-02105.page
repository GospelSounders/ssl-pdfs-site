Raymund prayed for 12 days that God would </div><div class="t m67e x17 h11 y3a2 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">help the rescuers find them alive. Then the news arrived, &quot;No </div><div class="t m170 x17 h11 y4dd ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">survivors.&quot; </div><div class="t m3c7 x18 h11 y3a3 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Raymund&apos;s father had been the head elder in their church. His </div><div class="t m705 x17 h11 y3a4 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">brother was a good Christian boy. Over and over 13-year-old </div><div class="t m3c0 x17 h11 y7dc ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Raymund asked God &quot;Why?&quot; But no answer came, and Raymund </div><div class="t m163 x17 h11 y7dd ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">became angry with God. </div><div class="t m196 x18 h11 y10 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">In time Raymund&apos;s mother remarried. But Raymund, still bit-</div><div class="t m1dd x17 h11 y3a6 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ter, began to rebel. He started smoking then drinking. Desperate, </div><div class="t m2ff x17 h11 y4e2 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">his mother sent him to the Adventist college. But Raymund did </div><div class="t m10d x17 h11 y3a8 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">not fit in. Beneath the surface the questions remained. Why had </div><div class="t m21e x17 h11 y3a9 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">God let his father and brother die? </div><div class="t m31b x18 h11 y4e4 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">A church pastor took a special interest in Raymund. One day he </div><div class="t mad x17 h11 y3aa ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">offered to take Raymund to Mountain View College in the Philip-</div><div class="t m636 x17 h11 y3ab ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">pines. Raymund jumped at the chance to get away from home, to </div><div class="t m43a x17 h11 y60a ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">start over. After a short flight and a long bus ride, Raymund and </div><div class="t m178 x17 h11 ycb ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the pastor arrived at the college. </div><div class="t m12d x1f h11 y4e6 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Raymund enrolled in the business course at Mountain View. </div><div class="t m64c x17 h11 y7de ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">He found the staff and students warm and friendly. Raymund </div><div class="t m706 x68 h11 y55a ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">learned that most of the popular students were members of the </div><div class="t m16e x68 h11 y3ae ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ministerial seminary, and he decided to join too. Every weekend </div><div class="t m62b x68 h11 y60c ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">they visited churches in nearby villages. In his efforts to help </div><div class="t m707 x68 h11 y7df ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">others, Raymund began to find healing for his own wounded </div><div class="t m23a x68 h11 y7e0 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">heart. He mastered many Bible topics so he could share with </div><div class="t mbc x68 h11 y7e1 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">others the truths his father had loved. </div><div class="t m353 x1f h11 y711 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;In serving others, I found Jesus as my own Friend and Sav-</div><div class="t m473 x68 h11 y4e9 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">iour,&quot; Raymund said.
