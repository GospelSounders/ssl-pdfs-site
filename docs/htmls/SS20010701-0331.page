He was challenged by the careful Bible </div><div class="t m1c0 x2e h13 y412 ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">study he found there and began attending regularly. However, the </div><div class="t m3af x2e h13 y216 ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">closer Jin drew to the Adventists, the farther Zhu drifted from </div><div class="t m286 x2e h13 y413 ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">them. Finally Zhu cast his lot with the Sunday-keeping church, in </div><div class="t mab x6f h13 y414 ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">hopes that the pastor would train him for a leadership position. </div><div class="t m1e2 x2e h13 y219 ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;I&apos;ll bring you some books that will prove the Adventists wrong,&quot; </div><div class="t m268 x6f h13 y415 ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">he told Jin. Jin wondered whether his friend was right and he was </div><div class="t m2ce x6f h13 y416 ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">wrong. After all, Christianity was so new to him, and the books </div><div class="t m8f x6f h13 y417 ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">were written by learned scholars. </div><div class="t m3b0 x67 h13 y418 ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">That night he dreamed that he found some books in an eagle&apos;s </div><div class="t m1be x6f h13 y419 ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">nest. He opened one and found it full of lies about God. He picked </div><div class="t m3a8 x6f h13 y41a ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">up another and found it contained lies as well. When Jin awoke he </div><div class="t m8b x6f h13 y41b ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">wondered what his dream meant. He decided to put his faith in </div><div class="t m10b x6f h13 y41c ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">God rather than in dreams. </div><div class="t mca x67 h13 y41d ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">When Zhu arrived with the books, Jin could hardly contain his </div><div class="t m6e x6f h13 y41e ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">surprise. The books Zhu carried were the same ones Jin had seen in </div><div class="t m3b1 x6f h13 y41f ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">his dream. He did not want to take the books, but his friend </div><div class="t m3b2 x6f h13 y420 ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">insisted. &quot;I&apos;ve gone to a lot of trouble to get these,&quot; Zhu said. &quot;Are </div><div class="t m261 x6f h13 y421 ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">you afraid you will lose confidence in your beliefs?&quot; </div><div class="t m3b3 x76 h13 y422 ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Jin told Zhu that God had already shown him the books and told </div><div class="t m11f x6f h13 y423 ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">him he should not read them. Under pressure, Jin finally took the </div><div class="t m3b4 x6f h13 y424 ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">books, but instead of reading them, he took them to a member of </div><div class="t m317 x6f h13 y425 ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the house church and asked her how to answer the accusations in </div><div class="t m1cb x6f h13 y426 ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the books. When she answered the accusations with Bible texts, </div><div class="t m55 x6f h13 y427 ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Jin was satisfied. </div><div class="t m1ee x7 h13 y428 ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Jin returned the books to his friend </div><div class="t m195 x91 h13 y429 ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and urged him to obey God&apos;s laws </div><div class="t m13d x91 h13 y42a ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">rather than man&apos;s rationales. But his </div><div class="t m335 x91 h13 y42b ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">friend refused. Jin studied the Bible </div><div class="t m24d x91 h13 y100 ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">with the members of the house church </div><div class="t m3b5 x91 h13 y42c ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and was baptized.
