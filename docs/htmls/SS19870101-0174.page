God&apos;s righteousness is not </div><div class="t m3b6 x5c h1e y9ae ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">merely an abstract quality of God&apos;s being. It is the way that God makes men and </div><div class="t m22b x5c h1e y9af ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">women right with Himselfâ€”His way of righting wrongs. God had brought the </div><div class="t m23e x5c h1e y9b0 ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">children of Israel out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand (verse 5). This was </div><div class="t m23d x5c h1e y981 ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">a righteous act. Daniel pled that God would again act righteously in restoring </div><div class="t m240 x5c h1e y9b1 ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">true worship in Jerusalem. </div><div class="t mcf x55 h1e y9b2 ff7 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;For the Lord&apos;s sake&quot; </div><div class="t m1a0 x43 h1e y9b3 ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">(verse 17). Daniel asked that the captivity and all that </div><div class="t m2e7 x5c h1e y9b4 ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">it entailed be changed so that God&apos;s name would be vindicated. He recognized </div><div class="t m434 x5c h1e y9b5 ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that the heathen world had a false conception of the power of God. This situation </div><div class="t m563 x5c h1e y726 ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">had to be changed, so that the heathen would not suppose that it was by the might </div><div class="t m564 x5c h1e y9b6 ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of their own gods that they were victorious and that the children of Judah were in </div><div class="t m565 x5c h1e y9b7 ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">captivity. </div><div class="t m404 x55 h1e y899 ff7 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;For thy great mercies&quot; </div><div class="t me8 x94 h1e y6dd ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">(verse 18). Daniel&apos;s plea was that God be merciful </div><div class="t m190 x5a h1e y72a ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">because it is only through His mercy that favor can be shown. </div><div class="t m2c3 x55 h1e y799 ff7 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;For thine own sake . . . for thy city and thy people are called by thy name&quot; </div><div class="t m296 x5a h1e y79a ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">(verse 19). Again Daniel&apos;s plea was based on God doing something to vindicate </div><div class="t m450 x5a h1e y79b ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">His name, His character. Our only hope is in God&apos;s righteousness, mercy, for-</div><div class="t m2eb x5c h1e y9b8 ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">giveness, and willingness to save us from sin. </div><div class="t m155 x55 h1e y79d ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">In his intercessory prayer Daniel threw himself on the mercy of God. It was </div><div class="t m22b x5a h1e y79e ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the only thing he could do. Having done this he was confident that God would </div><div class="t m456 x5a h1e y731 ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">not let him or his people down. </div><div class="t m3cf x55 h1f y9b9 ff1 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Why does God sometimes seem to take a long time to effect changes? </div><div class="t m271 x5a h1f y9ba ff1 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">2 Peter 3:9. </div><div class="t m256 x55 h1e y9bb ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Many of us always seem to be in a hurry. We can see things only from our </div><div class="t m13f x5a h1e y7a2 ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">limited persepective. But God sees the larger picture. He knows when it is best </div><div class="t m17c x5a h1e y9bc ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to effect changes. Our concept of time is different from God&apos;s. We may think </div><div class="t m566 x5a h1e y7a3 ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that God sometimes is delaying. But actually, God is being merciful, giving </div><div class="t m567 x5a h1e y9bd ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">everyone ample time to repent and be saved. We should not complain about </div><div class="t m16c x5a h1e y7a5 ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">apparent delays, but be thankful that God knows what is best and is in control. </div><div class="t m16a x9d h3a y6f2 ff3 fs23 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">WED </div><div class="t m186 x5a h1f y9be ff1 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">II.
