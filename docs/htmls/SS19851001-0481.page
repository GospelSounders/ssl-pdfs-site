The first church to receive a letter probably had copies made </div><div class="t m439 xa6 h1a yb18 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">for the benefit of other congregations. In that way a greater number of </div><div class="t m135 xa6 h1a yb19 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">believers were edified. By his reference to &quot;the other scriptures&quot; (2 Peter </div><div class="t m73f x64 h1a yb1a ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">3:16) Peter indicates that the early church had accepted Paul&apos;s letters as </div><div class="t m36e xa6 h1a yb1b ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">inspired and had begun to lay the groundwork for the sacred canon of the </div><div class="t m3a0 xa6 h1a yb1c ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">New Testament. </div><div class="t m426 x3c h1a yb1d ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The above considerations enlarge our view of church life in Asia Minor, </div><div class="t m5a1 xa6 h1a yb1e ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and beyond, during the early decades after Christ&apos;s ascension. Although </div><div class="t m30f xa6 h1a yb1f ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in most cases the groups of believers were scattered, they communicated </div><div class="t m35e xa6 h1a yb20 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">with each other. More interestingly still, it is possible to see Peter and </div><div class="t m6ad xa6 h1a yb21 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Paul both working in that large geographical area with both contributing </div><div class="t m3ae xa6 h1a yb22 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to the faith and works of congregations in which each was particularly </div><div class="t m71f xa6 h1a yb23 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">interested.

Should the search be widened, it may </div><div class="t m1f8 xa6 h1a yb2a ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">include the whole epistle, but that is scarcely needed, although Paul&apos;s vo-</div><div class="t m61 x76 h1a yb2b ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">luminous letters certainly covered most of the ground traversed by Peter </div><div class="t m5d x76 h1a yb2c ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in this epistle. However, the main thrust of the reference to Paul&apos;s epistles </div><div class="t m60d x76 h1a yb2d ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">concerns &quot;some things hard to be understood&quot; that have been twisted by </div><div class="t m742 x76 h1a yb2e ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the &quot;unlearned and unstable&quot; (verse 16). The Greek word for &quot;un-</div><div class="t m5c2 x76 h1a yb2f ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">learned&quot; is the opposite of the Greek word for learner or disciple. The </div><div class="t m743 x76 h1a yb30 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">word translated &quot;unstable&quot; refers to those who have no support. It is </div><div class="t m129 x76 h1a yb31 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">easy for such people to &quot;wrest&quot; or twist the Scriptures. The original word </div><div class="t m710 x76 h1a yb32 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">for &quot;wrest&quot; referred to torture on the rack when a victim&apos;s limbs were </div><div class="t m744 x76 h1a yb33 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">twisted or dislocatedâ€”a most vivid and painful picture of distortion of </div><div class="t m25 x76 h1a yb34 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">truth. </div><div class="t m5e0 x22 h1a y4f ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Few Bible students will quarrel with Peter&apos;s comment on Paul&apos;s epis-</div><div class="t m745 x76 h1a yb35 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tles, &quot;in which are some things hard to be understood.&quot; Indeed, the </div><div class="t mce x76 h1a yb36 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">casual Bible reader might describe it as an understatement, while the ear-</div><div class="t m369 x76 h1a yb37 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">nest student will agree as to its truth. But the difficulties in those epistles </div><div class="t m631 x76 h1a yb38 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">largely arise from the magnitude of the subjects with which they deal as </div><div class="t m62 x76 h1a yb39 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">well as with Paul&apos;s involved sentence structure. A finite being, although </div><div class="t m65 x11 h1a yb3a ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">inspired, is struggling to grasp infinity; a human is seeking to explain the </div><div class="t m5bb x76 h1a yb3b ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">divine; a mortal is trying to describe the immortal; a time-bound mind is </div><div class="t m38e x76 h1a yb3c ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">grappling with the nature of the eternal. It is not surprising that we who </div><div class="t m442 x76 h1a yb3d ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">work on lower planes should find it difficult to follow the workings of a </div><div class="t m668 x11 h1a yb3e ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">mastermind such as Paul&apos;s. When the inspiration factor is added we must </div><div class="t m2d x76 h1a y79a ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">expect our mental and spiritual capacities to be stretched beyond their </div><div class="t m4a5 x11 h1a yb3f ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">normal limits.
