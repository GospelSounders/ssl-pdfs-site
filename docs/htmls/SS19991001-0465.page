She did not know </div><div class="t m1b9 x1c h17 y67a ff2 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">where to go to get it extended. </div><div class="t m16d x56 h17 y67b ff2 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">By chance Rina met Mabel Ngui, who took her to the embassy </div><div class="t m553 x1c h17 y67c ff2 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to extend her visa.
