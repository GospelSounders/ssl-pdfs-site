They are growing up now, and they cannot remember their father </div><div class="t m10e x8 h1e y3c4 ff5 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">very well anymore. The constant brainwashing is having its effect. </div><div class="t m117 x94 h1e y3c5 ff5 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Your father does not care,&quot; their kidnapper tells them. &quot;You are mis-</div><div class="t m385 x44 h1e y3c6 ff5 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">erable? You have pain and grief? It is his fault. If he really cared, he </div><div class="t m376 x44 h1e y3c7 ff5 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">would not ignore you. But he has abandoned you. </div><div class="t m290 x94 h1e y2a6 ff5 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;But one of these days when you least expect it he will show up. And </div><div class="t m386 x44 h1e y3c8 ff5 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">when he does, he will haul every one of you into court on trumped-up </div><div class="t m37 x44 h1e y3c9 ff5 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">charges. He will be both judge and jury, and he will see to it that all of you </div><div class="t m387 x44 h1e y3ca ff5 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">are sentenced to death and executed. </div><div class="t m388 x7d h1e y3cb ff5 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;He says he is your father.

He tells them who he is, but they do not recognize him. It has </div><div class="t m38b x44 h1e y3d0 ff5 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">been too long. And they are suspicious of him because he says he has </div><div class="t m4e x44 h1e y3d1 ff5 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">lived with their father all these years. </div><div class="t m26a x7d h1e y27a ff5 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Slowly, gently, he begins to tell them the truth about their father—that </div><div class="t m13e x44 h1e y27b ff5 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">he loves each of them more than life itself.

But sadly, some of the children choose to </div><div class="t m38f x44 h1e y3d6 ff5 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">believe their captor rather than their older brother, and thus the story has </div><div class="t m390 x44 h1e y3d7 ff5 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">a bittersweet ending. </div><div class="t m391 x71 h3 y286 ff1 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ILLUMINATION: </div><div class="t m32b x12 h1e y286 ff5 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;The enemy of good blinded the minds of men, so that </div><div class="t m392 x44 h1e y3d8 ff5 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">they looked upon God with fear; they thought of Him as severe and </div><div class="t m393 x44 h1e y3d9 ff5 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">unforgiving.
