During the 15 months I spent working in public health in </div><div class="t m217 x35 h9 y1ff ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">south Sudan, broken bones, malaria, and other hardships threatened </div><div class="t m218 x35 h9 y200 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">our work.

The rain-rutted </div><div class="t m21c x35 h9 y204 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">roads made travel painful at best. Halfway to our destination we were </div><div class="t m21d x35 h9 y205 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">stopped by a roadblock. When the base commander saw us he asked </div><div class="t m17e x35 h9 y206 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">us to examine a Dinka woman who had been in labor for five days. </div><div class="t mbc x35 h9 y207 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">George, a Kenyan nurse, and I examined her and agreed to take her to </div><div class="t m1ea x35 h9 y41 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">a hospital four hours away. </div><div class="t m21e x74 h9 y208 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">We squeezed back into the jeep and continued our journey.

I wrapped the baby boy in my bath towel while George </div><div class="t m208 x3b h9 y210 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">worked on the little girl. After several minutes the little girl began </div><div class="t m225 x3b h9 y211 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to breathe on her own! </div><div class="t m1a7 x74 h9 y212 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">After Mary had rested a bit we loaded her and the twins into the </div><div class="t m226 x3b h9 y213 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">back of the vehicle.
