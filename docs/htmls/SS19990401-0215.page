During the 15 months I spent working in public health in </div><div class="t m217 x36 hb y200 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">south Sudan, broken bones, malaria, and other hardships threatened </div><div class="t m218 x36 hb y201 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">our work. But some experiences made it all worthwhile. This was one </div><div class="t m219 x36 hb y202 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of them. </div><div class="t m21a x75 hb y203 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Six of us crammed into ADRA&apos;s tiny utility vehicle for the eight-</div><div class="t m21b x36 hb y204 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">hour trip to the ADRA base camp in South Sudan. The rain-rutted </div><div class="t m21c x36 hb y205 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">roads made travel painful at best. Halfway to our destination we were </div><div class="t m21d x36 hb y206 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">stopped by a roadblock. When the base commander saw us he asked </div><div class="t m17e x36 hb y207 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">us to examine a Dinka woman who had been in labor for five days. </div><div class="t mbc x36 hb y208 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">George, a Kenyan nurse, and I examined her and agreed to take her to </div><div class="t m1ea x36 hb y42 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">a hospital four hours away. </div><div class="t m21e x75 hb y209 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">We squeezed back into the jeep and continued our journey. Two </div><div class="t m21f x36 hb y20a ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">hours later Mary, the expectant mother, began to fidget and perspire. </div><div class="t m20d x36 hb y20b ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">George suggested we stop and examine her again. We laid my bed </div><div class="t m220 x36 hb y20c ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sheet on the tall savanna grass beside the road and examined Mary </div><div class="t m221 x36 hb y20d ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">again. The baby was comingâ€”now! </div><div class="t m209 x75 hb y66 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">George quickly went to work, but Mary delivered a baby boy </div><div class="t m222 x3c hb y20e ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">before we were ready.

I wrapped the baby boy in my bath towel while George </div><div class="t m208 x3c hb y211 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">worked on the little girl. After several minutes the little girl began </div><div class="t m225 x3c hb y212 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to breathe on her own! </div><div class="t m1a7 x75 hb y213 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">After Mary had rested a bit we loaded her and the twins into the </div><div class="t m226 x3c hb y214 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">back of the vehicle.
