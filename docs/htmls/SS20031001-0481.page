As a child she was shifted </div><div class="t m559 x71 h16 y3fc ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">from one relative to another to live and work. By age 13 she worked as </div><div class="t m148 x71 h16 y758 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">a servant. She married young and had five children, before her hus-</div><div class="t m16 x71 h16 y4de ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">band left her. She supports the family by washing clothes. </div><div class="t m5f0 x4b h16 y759 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">When her youngest child was admitted to the hospital, Florentine </div><div class="t m5f1 x71 h16 y3fd ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">met a woman, who invited her to church. Florentine believed in God, </div><div class="t m5f2 x71 h16 y3fe ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">but she was not interested in the woman&apos;s invitation, because she did </div><div class="t mb0 x71 h16 y3ff ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">not know which church was God&apos;s true church. The woman urged her </div><div class="t m5f3 x71 h16 y4a ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to ask God to show her the church she should attend. </div><div class="t m52 x4b h16 y40e ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Florentine began to pray, &quot;God, I know You want me to attend </div><div class="t m27e x71 h16 y4f5 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">church. Please show me the church where You want me to worship </div><div class="t m37c x71 h16 y4ec ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">You, so I and my children can be saved.&quot; </div><div class="t m5f4 x4b h16 y4ed ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The next day an Adventist woman visited her home and invited her </div><div class="t m389 x71 h16 y45b ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to attend evangelistic meetings. Florentine felt this woman&apos;s visit was </div><div class="t mad x71 h16 y4ee ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">an answer to her prayer. She took her children to the meetings. She </div><div class="t m5f5 x5b h16 y45c ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">wrote down the Bible references that the pastor quoted, but she had no </div><div class="t m5f6 x5b h16 y45d ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Bible to look them up. So she borrowed a Bible. Soon she realized that </div><div class="t m5f7 x5b h16 y415 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">this was the church that taught all of God&apos;s commandments. </div><div class="t m5f8 x4b h16 y436 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Florentine asked for prayer to quit smoking and to find work that </div><div class="t m1a4 x71 h16 y45e ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">allowed her to keep the Sabbath. The unskilled work she did required </div><div class="t m5f9 x5b h16 y437 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that she work every day in order to feed her family. If she did not work, </div><div class="t m19c x5b h16 y18d ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">they did not eat. </div><div class="t m38 xbe h16 y438 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Following the prayers on her behalf, Florentine was able to quit </div><div class="t m5fa x5b h16 y654 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">smoking. The evangelist asked her to work in his garden to earn a little </div><div class="t m55d x5b h16 y439 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">money. Soon she began washing the family&apos;s clothes too. </div><div class="t m291 xbe h16 y4d7 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Some weeks later Florentine and two of her five children were </div><div class="t m5fb x5b h16 y43a ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">baptized. Then one of her sons left home to stay with his father. But his </div><div class="t m2fe x53 h16 y419 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">father sent him back to her. Florentine </div><div class="t m5fc x53 h16 y34e ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">believes that God sent the boy back in </div><div class="t m5fd x53 h16 y4f2 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">answer to her prayers, so that he would </div><div class="t m5fe x53 h16 y191 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">remain in the influence of a Christian </div><div class="t m5ff x53 h16 y4d8 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">home. </div><div class="t m12d x75 h16 y294 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Florentine still does not have her </div><div class="t m459 x53 h16 y34f ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">own Bible.
