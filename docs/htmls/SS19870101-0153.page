This indicates the direction of Daniel&apos;s thought; he </div><div class="t mcb x84 h1e y70a ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was concerned about Jerusalem. Furthermore, Solomon in his dedicatory prayer </div><div class="t m18a x84 h1e y70b ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of the temple, had suggested that effective prayer should be offered in the direc-</div><div class="t m445 x84 h1e y70c ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tion of Jerusalem.

Nor did Daniel feel that he ought to keep his religious practices </div><div class="t m1af x84 h1e y70f ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">secret. Even when he would be breaking the law of the land by praying, he felt </div><div class="t m446 x84 h1e y83 ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that the honest thing to do was to continue worshiping openly as he had done </div><div class="t m2c6 x84 h1e y710 ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">before. To do otherwise would be to show fear of what people may do, or to </div><div class="t m265 x84 h1e y711 ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">practice deceit. </div><div class="t m99 x4a h1e y712 ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">o </div><div class="t m234 x21 h1e y712 ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Daniel was not doing something merely to be contrary.

In the </div><div class="t mf5 x84 h1e y713 ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">circumstances his conscience told him that he must be true to his religious princi-</div><div class="t m128 x85 h1e y714 ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ples.
