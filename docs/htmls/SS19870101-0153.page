This indicates the direction of Daniel&apos;s thought; he </div><div class="t mcb x85 h1c y709 ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was concerned about Jerusalem. Furthermore, Solomon in his dedicatory prayer </div><div class="t m18a x85 h1c y70a ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of the temple, had suggested that effective prayer should be offered in the direc-</div><div class="t m445 x85 h1c y70b ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tion of Jerusalem.

Nor did Daniel feel that he ought to keep his religious practices </div><div class="t m1af x85 h1c y70e ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">secret.

In the </div><div class="t mf5 x85 h1c y712 ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">circumstances his conscience told him that he must be true to his religious princi-</div><div class="t m128 x86 h1c y713 ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ples.
