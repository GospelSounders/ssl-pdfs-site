He attended a military school, where he </div><div class="t m1d0 x26 h8 y293 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">learned that the strongest prevail. He worked hard to strengthen his body </div><div class="t mff x26 h8 y779 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and focus his mind. </div><div class="t maa x49 h8 y92 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">After completing his training in military school, he joined some friends </div><div class="t m2f0 x26 h8 y9e9 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to start a small business. But his life was not going as he wished. One day </div><div class="t m2c5 x26 h8 y296 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">he realized that he felt empty, with no sense of purpose or meaning in life. </div><div class="t mf7 x26 h8 y297 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">If there were no meaning to life, what was the difference?

He began searching it for answers. </div><div class="t m302 x26 h8 y9eb ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">An Adventist friend invited Nyamdavaa to church, and he went.

His family thought he was </div><div class="t m41d x26 h8 y9ee ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">crazy, for he spent all his time reading and praying.

During his three months there, he experienced several </div><div class="t m2c5 x84 h8 y9f3 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">miracles of protection and providence. One exercise required him to swim </div><div class="t m1e6 x84 h8 y29f ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">across a river, but Nyamdavaa could not swim. He prayed for God&apos;s pro-</div><div class="t m11d x84 h8 y9f4 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tection as he jumped into the water.
