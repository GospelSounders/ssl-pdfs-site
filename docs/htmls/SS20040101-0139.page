Then he reminded </div><div class="t m65 x62 h2 y148 ff1 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">himself of his promise to visit every apartment. </div><div class="t m280 x19 h2 y371 ff1 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Tars raised his hand to knock on the aging and broken door. Surely the </div><div class="t m46d x62 h2 y497 ff1 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">person living here spends their meager earnings on things other than his </div><div class="t m2d2 x62 h2 y498 ff1 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">or her home, he thought. </div><div class="t m46e x19 h2 y499 ff1 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">A man answered the knock and opened the door. He hesitated before he </div><div class="t m3de x62 h2 y373 ff1 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">let Tars come in, saying his apartment was untidy. And it was. Plastic bags </div><div class="t m1f4 x62 h2 y49a ff1 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">filled with empty alcohol bottles littered the floor. Tars decided that the </div><div class="t m206 x62 h2 y3fc ff1 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">man must collect empty vodka bottles to earn money for his own alcohol. </div><div class="t m3e9 x19 h2 y49b ff1 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Tars wondered what he should say to the man. &quot;Do you believe in God?&quot; </div><div class="t m169 x62 h2 y49c ff1 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">he asked. </div><div class="t m167 x19 h2 y49d ff1 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The man answered, &quot;Yes, somewhere in my heart I believe in God, but I </div><div class="t m1ad x62 h2 y49e ff1 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">do not think there is anything that can help me in my situation.&quot; </div><div class="t m46f x19 h2 y49f ff1 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Tars shared stories of others whose lives God had rescued from drugs, </div><div class="t m470 x62 h2 y4a0 ff1 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">alcohol, and other vices. He assured the man that Christ can change his </div><div class="t m457 x62 h2 y4a1 ff1 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">heart, too.

The man was interested, and </div><div class="t m472 x62 h2 y4a5 ff1 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">when Tars told him the book was $1, the man began searching for money. </div><div class="t m75 x55 h2 y4a6 ff1 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">He dug into his pockets, into the couch, every place he had ever left </div><div class="t m1d x55 h2 y4a7 ff1 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">money, until he found enough to buy the book. </div><div class="t m1d x2b h2 y4a8 ff1 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Tars knew that to buy this book the man would go hungry, but the man </div><div class="t m3a5 x55 h2 y4a9 ff1 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">wanted the book. &quot;Now I have no money for bread,&quot; he said, handing the </div><div class="t m20 x55 h2 y4aa ff1 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">money to Tars. </div><div class="t m474 x2b h2 y4ab ff1 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Take out a few rubles for bread, and I will make up the amount myself,&quot; </div><div class="t m54 x55 h2 y4ac ff1 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Tars answered.
