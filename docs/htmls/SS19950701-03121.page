The government forbade churches to collect tithes or </div><div class="t m6f6 xa h14 yc61 ff1 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">obtain other financial support, so churches had to keep their </div><div class="t m6f7 xa h14 yc62 ff1 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">offerings a secret. We could not put money into a bank, so we had </div><div class="t m22a xb h14 y440 ff1 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to keep large sums of money at home. </div><div class="t m15a x77 h14 y49c ff1 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">We knew that at any time the police or the KGB could bang on </div><div class="t m698 xb h14 yc63 ff1 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">our door and search our home.

In the spring, before the birds returned to </div><div class="t mb3 xb h14 yc6a ff1 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">nest, our elder son climbed the tree and cleaned the nesting box. </div><div class="t m12e xb h14 y428 ff1 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Then, after making sure that our neighbors were not watching, </div><div class="t m4e9 x7 h14 y393 ff1 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">my husband handed our son a packet of large bills wrapped in </div><div class="t m572 x7 h14 yc6b ff1 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">plastic. &quot;Put this on the bottom to warm the box and put some dry </div><div class="t mb0 xb h14 y12e ff1 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">grass on it,&quot; he instructed our son. </div><div class="t m3c7 x88 h14 y44b ff1 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Eventually birds came, laid their eggs, and hatched their brood </div><div class="t mfe x7 h14 y130 ff1 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in the nest.
