Believers relied on </div><div class="t m184 xb h18 yc5a ff1 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">God&apos;s guidance and protection as we sought to further God&apos;s </div><div class="t m372 xb h18 yc5b ff1 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">cause in an atheistic society. We understood very distinctively </div><div class="t m2cb xb h18 yc5c ff1 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the admonition of Jesus to be &quot;wise as serpents, and harmless as </div><div class="t m6f4 xb h18 yc5d ff1 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">doves&quot; (Matt. 10:16). God gave wisdom to church ministers </div><div class="t mfb xb h18 yc5e ff1 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">during the trying times we faced. </div><div class="t m215 x78 h18 yc5f ff1 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">As a church pastor, my husband often had to keep the church&apos;s </div><div class="t m6f5 x4c h18 yc60 ff1 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ii</div><div class="t m260 xc h18 yc61 ff1 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">money. The government forbade churches to collect tithes or </div><div class="t m6f6 xb h18 yc62 ff1 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">obtain other financial support, so churches had to keep their </div><div class="t m6f7 xb h18 yc63 ff1 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">offerings a secret. We could not put money into a bank, so we had </div><div class="t m22a xc h18 y441 ff1 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to keep large sums of money at home. </div><div class="t m15a x78 h18 y49d ff1 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">We knew that at any time the police or the KGB could bang on </div><div class="t m698 xc h18 yc64 ff1 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">our door and search our home.

Large sums were </div><div class="t m2f3 xc h18 yc68 ff1 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">often kept by trusted church members. One pastor hid the church </div><div class="t m32c xc h18 yc69 ff1 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">moneys in beehives. My husband chose a birdhouse for his &quot;trea-</div><div class="t m59c xc h18 y12c ff1 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sury.&quot; Near our house grew a tall pear tree. He placed a bird-</div><div class="t m3f0 xc h18 yc6a ff1 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">house high in the tree. In the spring, before the birds returned to </div><div class="t mb3 xc h18 yc6b ff1 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">nest, our elder son climbed the tree and cleaned the nesting box. </div><div class="t m12e xc h18 y429 ff1 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Then, after making sure that our neighbors were not watching, </div><div class="t m4e9 x8 h18 y394 ff1 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">my husband handed our son a packet of large bills wrapped in </div><div class="t m572 x8 h18 yc6c ff1 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">plastic. &quot;Put this on the bottom to warm the box and put some dry </div><div class="t mb0 xc h18 y12f ff1 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">grass on it,&quot; he instructed our son. </div><div class="t m3c7 x89 h18 y44c ff1 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Eventually birds came, laid their eggs, and hatched their brood </div><div class="t mfe x8 h18 y131 ff1 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in the nest.
