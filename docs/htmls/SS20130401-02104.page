Sandy helped the people plant and </div><div class="t m0 x64 h36 y374 ff10 fs3 fc3 sc0 ls2 ws7c">harvest their crops, and Yolande braided the women’s hair. Then the </div><div class="t m0 x64 h36 y375 ff10 fs3 fc3 sc0 ls2 ws5">couple invited their new friends to learn about Christ.</div><div class="t m0 x14 h36 y376 ff10 fs3 fc3 sc0 ls2 wsa4">They started a literacy center to teach the villagers to read and write </div><div class="t m0 x64 h36 y377 ff10 fs3 fc3 sc0 ls2 ws49">better. Yolande now teaches the younger children and youth while Sandy </div><div class="t m0 x64 h36 y378 ff10 fs3 fc3 sc0 ls2 ws87">teaches the adults. They hope that soon the people will be able to read the </div><div class="t m0 x64 h36 y379 ff10 fs3 fc3 sc0 ls2 ws8e">Bible for themselves. They include worship as part of their literacy pro<span class="ws4">-</span></div><div class="t m0 x64 h36 y37a ff10 fs3 fc3 sc0 ls2 ws5">gram, and the villagers found great interest in getting to know Jesus. </div><div class="t m0 x14 h36 y37b ff10 fs3 fc3 sc0 ls2 ws82">Recently Sandy and Yolande held evangelistic meetings in a village </div><div class="t m0 x64 h36 y37c ff10 fs3 fc3 sc0 ls2 ws80">known for its rough gangs. One night they were startled to see a group of </div><div class="t m0 x64 h36 y37d ff10 fs3 fc3 sc0 ls2 ws96">gang members who were carrying guns enter the meeting. Sandy knew </div><div class="t m0 x64 h36 y37e ff10 fs3 fc3 sc0 ls2 wse9">that the gang would make trouble if they felt that he was imposing on </div><div class="t m0 x64 h36 y37f ff10 fs3 fc3 sc0 ls2 ws5">their territory. </div><div class="t m0 x14 h36 y380 ff10 fs3 fc3 sc0 ls2 ws9a">Haja, the gang leader, was tough, and it was obvious that the other gang </div><div class="t m0 x64 h36 y381 ff10 fs3 fc3 sc0 ls2 ws2c">members respected him. But Sandy and Yolande weren’t afraid. “I talked </div><div class="t m0 x64 h36 y382 ff10 fs3 fc3 sc0 ls2 ws55">to Haja and asked him to make sure his gang members were there every </div><div class="t m0 x64 h36 y383 ff10 fs3 fc3 sc0 ls2 ws5">night,” Sandy said.</div><div class="t m0 x14 h36 y384 ff10 fs3 fc3 sc0 ls2 wse0">And Haja and his 20 gang members did come to the meetings every </div><div class="t m0 x64 h36 y385 ff10 fs3 fc3 sc0 ls2 ws106">night. In fact, Haja was one of the 31 people who was baptized at the end </div><div class="t m0 x64 h36 y386 ff10 fs3 fc3 sc0 ls2 ws37">of the meetings. He’s no longer the gang leader. Instead, he’s preparing </div><div class="t m0 x64 h36 y387 ff10 fs3 fc3 sc0 ls2 ws38">to become a Sabbath School leader. He’s still influential among his gang </div><div class="t m0 x64 h36 y388 ff10 fs3 fc3 sc0 ls2 ws5">friends and encourages them to come to church. </div><div class="t m0 x14 h36 y389 ff10 fs3 fc3 sc0 ls2 ws13c">Sandy and Yolande face many challenges in their work. Dirty water </div><div class="t m0 x64 h36 y38a ff10 fs3 fc3 sc0 ls2 wsaa">often makes the people sick. Many of the villagers want nothing to do </div><div class="t m0 x64 h36 y38b ff10 fs3 fc3 sc0 ls2 wsad">with Christianity. Some believe in witchcraft and fear a woman who is the </div><div class="t m0 x64 h36 y38c ff10 fs3 fc3 sc0 ls2 ws5">local witch doctor. Alcohol use is prevalent. </div><div class="t m0 x14 h36 y38d ff10 fs3 fc3 sc0 ls2 wsd3">But this Global Mission couple isn’t discouraged. “We love the people </div><div class="t m0 x64 h36 y38e ff10 fs3 fc3 sc0 ls2 ws64">God has sent us to minister to,” says Sandy. “We praise Him for the 60 </div><div class="t m0 x64 h36 y38f ff10 fs3 fc3 sc0 ls2 ws1a">people who have joined God’s family and the two churches we’ve been </div><div class="t m0 x64 h36 y390 ff10 fs3 fc3 sc0 ls2 ws38">able to start here.
