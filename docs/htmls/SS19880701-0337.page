In departing, Christ could send the Spirit to bring </div><div class="t m3fd x16 h1e y524 ff5 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Himself to be present everywhere. Cumbered with humanity, Christ no </div><div class="t m171 x21 h1e y525 ff5 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">longer had omnipresence. This is why it was expedient that He depart. </div><div class="t m15 x16 h1e y526 ff5 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Rather than be limited to one place at a time, through the Spirit He could be </div><div class="t m17b x21 h1e y42c ff5 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">everywhere all the time. With this in mind, Jesus said, &quot;I will ask the Fa-</div><div class="t m1bf x21 h1e y195 ff5 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ther, and He will give you another Counselor . . . the Spirit of truth. . . . I </div><div class="t mb9 x21 h1e y527 ff5 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">will not leave you as orphans; I will come to you&quot; (John 14:16-18, NIV). </div><div class="t m6c x44 h1d y528 ff6 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">What new names are given to the Holy Spirit in the New Testament? </div><div class="t m29c x21 h1d y529 ff6 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">John 14:16, 17. </div><div class="t m3fe x44 h1e y101 ff5 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">In the New Testament age the Holy Spirit brings Christ to people in a way </div><div class="t m56 x21 h1e y430 ff5 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">not done before. Incarnation has made a decisive difference to God&apos;s Son. </div><div class="t m242 x21 h1e y431 ff5 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Now He is human forever. His life and death have made a decisive differ-</div><div class="t m390 x21 h1e y44f ff5 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ence to us. What He has wrought out for us needs now to be applied within </div><div class="t m284 x21 h1e y105 ff5 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">us. The Spirit does not add to what Christ has done any more than a mailman </div><div class="t m3ff x21 h1e y434 ff5 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">adds to the letter he delivers. There still is only one name &quot;given among </div><div class="t m400 x21 h1e y411 ff5 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">men whereby we must be saved,&quot; and that is Jesus (Acts 4:12). It still is true </div><div class="t mc5 x21 h1e y451 ff5 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">about Jesus, that &quot; &apos;no one comes to the Father except through me&apos; &quot; (John </div><div class="t m33 x21 h1e y109 ff5 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">14:6, NIV). The Spirit does not apply Christ&apos;s work to people on earth—He </div><div class="t m2ee x21 h1e y52a ff5 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">brings Christ Himself to make the application. </div><div class="t m1fc x44 h1d y453 ff6 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">What part does the Holy Spirit have in interceding for us before the </div><div class="t m38a x21 h1d y52b ff6 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">throne of God? How does this indicate His love for us? Rom. 8:26, 27. </div><div class="t m29b x21 h1d y52c ff6 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">IV. THE SPIRIT&apos;S WORK IN US. </div><div class="t m401 x44 h1e y17d ff5 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">John 14, 15, and 16 record Christ&apos;s description of the work of the Holy </div><div class="t m11a x3d h1e y17e ff5 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Spirit.
