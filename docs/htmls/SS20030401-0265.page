She admits she was </div><div class="t m563 x9 h14 y5cd ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">not a nice person. She lied, gossiped, and did many other things that </div><div class="t m3bd x9 h14 y5ce ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">she is not proud of. When she attended school in another city, she </div><div class="t m43f x9 h14 y5cf ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">made friends with young people who influenced her to smoke and </div><div class="t m2dc x9 h14 y5d0 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">drink. Even Nara worried about what was becoming of herself. She </div><div class="t m5ab x9 h14 y5d1 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">felt an emptiness in her life, but she did not know how to fill it. </div><div class="t m5ac x8 h14 y5d2 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Nara&apos;s family was worried and told her to come home. But even in </div><div class="t m2e3 x9 h14 y73 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the little village, Nara found friends who shared her bad habits. They </div><div class="t m5ad x9 h14 y74 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">stayed out late and drank, and sometimes she did not return home. </div><div class="t m5ae xd h14 y5d3 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Desperate to get her away from her destructive friends, her family sent </div><div class="t m5af xd h14 y5d4 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">her to live with a relative far away from the cities and towns. Nara </div><div class="t m5b0 xd h14 y5d5 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">hated living so far from everyone and soon returned to the village. </div><div class="t m5b1 x4a h14 y5d6 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Back home, Nara met two young women from Ulaanbaatar, mis-</div><div class="t m2b6 xd h14 y5d7 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sionaries who were working in the town. A friend of Nara&apos;s was </div><div class="t m5b2 xd h14 y5d8 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">attending a group meeting in the missionaries&apos; home and invited Nara </div><div class="t m5ab xd h14 y5d9 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to go and meet her brother from Ulaanbaatar. Nara was not interested </div><div class="t m82 xd h14 y5da ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in the meetings, but she wanted to meet her friend&apos;s brother. </div><div class="t m2de x4a h14 y5db ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Nara went to the meeting and felt the love of the young people. She </div><div class="t m3e0 xd h14 y5dc ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">continued to attend the meetings and made new friends there. Sud-</div><div class="t m16 xd h14 y5dd ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">denly, her former friends did not appeal to her. The Christians shared </div><div class="t m124 xd h14 y5de ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">their love for Jesus with her. They spent time talking and singing about </div><div class="t m5b3 xd h14 y5df ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">God and shared their faith with Nara, drawing her to Christ. Several </div><div class="t m4ad xd h14 y5e0 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">months later, Nara was baptized. </div><div class="t m5b4 x4a h14 y5e1 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">But Nara&apos;s family was not excited about her Christian friends.

But to </div><div class="t m5b6 xd h14 y5e4 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">her surprise, he listened to her testimony and quietly told her that she had </div><div class="t m5b7 xd h14 y5e5 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">chosen the best path. &quot;Continue growing in your faith,&quot; he said. </div><div class="t m14 x4 h14 y5e6 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Nara thanks God for changing her </div><div class="t m138 xc2 h14 y587 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">life.
