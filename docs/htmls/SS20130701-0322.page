Soon he would take the </div><div class="t m0 x3c h4 y2de ff23 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls1 ws19">national exams that would grant—or deny—him the right to pursue higher </div><div class="t m0 x3c h4 y2df ff23 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls1 ws1a">education. Roger had taken the exams before, but when one of the exams </div><div class="t m0 x3c h4 y2e0 ff23 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls1 wsec">fell on Sabbath, he had chosen to honor God rather than take the exam.

The director had been </div><div class="t m0 x3c h4 y2e8 ff23 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls1 ws18">polite, but his response was simply “We’ll see how it goes.” Roger could </div><div class="t m0 x3c h4 y2e9 ff23 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls1 ws1">only hope—and pray—that the man would honor his request. </div><div class="t m0 x6 h4 y2ea ff23 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls1 wsd6">When Roger looked at his class schedule, he saw that nearly every exam </div><div class="t m0 x3c h4 y2eb ff23 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls1 wsee">was scheduled for a Sabbath.
