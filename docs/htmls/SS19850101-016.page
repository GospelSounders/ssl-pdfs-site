Our study will provide us </div><div class="t mcf x30 hd yc7 ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">many insights into how He desires to meet our needs today. </div><div class="t md0 x31 hd yc8 ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">This quarterly introduces the Bible Book curriculum that will be pre-</div><div class="t md1 x30 hd yc9 ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sented in a new study format. The new curriculum will take us through </div><div class="t md2 x30 hd yca ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">every book of the Bible in the next ten years and will concentrate on </div><div class="t md3 x30 hd ycb ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">showing how each Bible book meets current human needs. The new for-</div><div class="t md4 x30 hd ycc ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">mat is designed to foster deeper Bible study. You may elect not to read all </div><div class="t md5 x30 hd ycd ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the passages listed or not to do all the exercises outlined in a lesson. But </div><div class="t md6 x30 hd yce ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">they are provided for the benefit of those who wish to do more in-depth </div><div class="t md7 x30 hd ycf ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">study. </div><div class="t md8 x31 hd yd0 ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The old adage, &quot;we are what we eat,&quot; suggests one reason why we </div><div class="t md9 x30 hd yd1 ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">need more in-depth Bible study. It applies not only to the physical dimen-</div><div class="t mda x30 hd yd2 ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sion of life but also to the spiritual. If our spiritual diet is impoverished </div><div class="t mdb x30 hd yd3 ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and we try to feed our souls on the husks of the commonplace and the </div><div class="t mdc x30 hd yd4 ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">uninspired, our minds and souls will become dwarfed and cheapened. </div><div class="t mdd x30 hd yd5 ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth </div><div class="t mde x32 hd yd6 ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">out of the mouth of God&quot; (Matt. 4:4). All of us need regular daily Bible </div><div class="t mdf x32 hd yd7 ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">study as much as, if not more than, we need regular meals. </div><div class="t me0 x31 hd yd8 ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Another good reason for engaging in daily Bible study is suggested by </div><div class="t me1 x32 hd yd9 ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Ellen White: &quot;We need to search the Scriptures daily, that we may know </div><div class="t me2 x32 hd yda ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the way of the Lord, and that we be not deceived by religious fallacies. </div><div class="t me3 x32 hd y15 ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The world is full of false theories and seductive spiritualistic ideas, which </div><div class="t me4 x32 hd ydb ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tend to destroy clear spiritual perception, and to lead away from truth and </div><div class="t me5 x32 hd ydc ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">holiness.
