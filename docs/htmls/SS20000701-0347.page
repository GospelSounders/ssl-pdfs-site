But her success as a singer could </div><div class="t m4df x5a he y398 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">not fill the emptiness in her life. She recognized that forces of good </div><div class="t m4e0 x5a he y4f3 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and evil existed in the world, but she did not know what their existence </div><div class="t m3fb x5a he y4f4 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">meant for her. She read books on various religious philosophies, but </div><div class="t m4e1 x5a he y1b5 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was disappointed when they did not point her toward Allah, or God. </div><div class="t m1e8 x5a he y23e ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">She began studying the Qu&apos;ran and the Bible, but she found the </div><div class="t m4e2 x5a he y1b7 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Qur&apos;an too difficult to understand. </div><div class="t ma9 x6c he y39c ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Then while browsing a bookstore, she found </div><div class="t m10b x2a he y4f5 ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The Acts of the </div><div class="t m4a1 x5a he y241 ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Apostles </div><div class="t m1a6 x9c he y1b8 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and </div><div class="t m4e3 x43 he y1b8 ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Steps to Christ. </div><div class="t m3ae x37 he y1b8 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">In these books she found answers to her </div><div class="t m4c7 x5a he y39d ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">deepest questions. She accepted their teachings and began searching </div><div class="t m33a x5a he y1ba ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">for a church that followed the principles taught in these books. She </div><div class="t m1cd x5a he y39e ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">visited several religious meetings, but was disappointed. Finally she </div><div class="t m199 x5a he y244 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">started her own small group. </div><div class="t m113 x6c he y245 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Then she met Victor, a literature evangelist, who shared his faith </div><div class="t m4e4 x5a he y246 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">with her and made the Bible seem easy to understand. But she politely </div><div class="t m4d0 x71 he y386 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">refused his invitations to attend religious meetings. &quot;I do not trust </div><div class="t m4e5 x71 he y247 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">religious teachers,&quot; she answered. &quot;They have disappointed me.&quot; </div><div class="t m4e6 x6c he y4ad ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Victor invited her to watch video Bible studies, and Ulzhan agreed. </div><div class="t m4e7 x71 he y4ae ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">She was delighted with the videos, and after viewing several, she and her </div><div class="t m4e8 x71 he y4af ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">friends decided to visit the church with Victor. Ulzhan was so thrilled </div><div class="t m459 x71 he y48 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">with the church members&apos; friendliness that she offered to sing for the </div><div class="t m58 x71 he y387 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">service. But the cautious pastor told her that she would have to be a </div><div class="t m4e9 x71 he y4f6 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">member before she could sing. Rather than being put off, Ulzhan and two </div><div class="t m4ea x71 he y389 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of her friends joined the baptismal class.
