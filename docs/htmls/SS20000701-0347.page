But her success as a singer could </div><div class="t m4df x59 hc y397 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">not fill the emptiness in her life. She recognized that forces of good </div><div class="t m4e0 x59 hc y4f2 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and evil existed in the world, but she did not know what their existence </div><div class="t m3fb x59 hc y4f3 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">meant for her. She read books on various religious philosophies, but </div><div class="t m4e1 x59 hc y1b4 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was disappointed when they did not point her toward Allah, or God. </div><div class="t m1e8 x59 hc y23d ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">She began studying the Qu&apos;ran and the Bible, but she found the </div><div class="t m4e2 x59 hc y1b6 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Qur&apos;an too difficult to understand. </div><div class="t ma9 x6b hc y39b ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Then while browsing a bookstore, she found </div><div class="t m10b x29 hc y4f4 ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The Acts of the </div><div class="t m4a1 x59 hc y240 ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Apostles </div><div class="t m1a6 x9b hc y1b7 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and </div><div class="t m4e3 x42 hc y1b7 ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Steps to Christ. </div><div class="t m3ae x36 hc y1b7 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">In these books she found answers to her </div><div class="t m4c7 x59 hc y39c ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">deepest questions.

She </div><div class="t m1cd x59 hc y39d ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">visited several religious meetings, but was disappointed.

But the cautious pastor told her that she would have to be a </div><div class="t m4e9 x70 hc y4f5 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">member before she could sing. Rather than being put off, Ulzhan and two </div><div class="t m4ea x70 hc y388 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of her friends joined the baptismal class.
