Things </div><div class="t m0 x5f h36 y1e2 ff12 fs3 fc3 sc0 ls2 ws97">were going well until the boy’s father returned home from prison, where </div><div class="t m0 x5f h36 y1e3 ff12 fs3 fc3 sc0 ls2 ws6">he had been serving a sentence for murder. </div><div class="t m0 x4a h36 y1e4 ff12 fs3 fc3 sc0 ls2 wsb6">At first the young man’s father was impressed with the changes he </div><div class="t m0 x5f h36 y1e5 ff12 fs3 fc3 sc0 ls2 ws35">saw in his son. But when he learned that his son had been studying with </div><div class="t m0 x5f h36 y1e6 ff12 fs3 fc3 sc0 ls2 ws3d">a Christian, he became furious. He felt he had to save his son from the </div><div class="t m0 x5f h36 y1e7 ff12 fs3 fc3 sc0 ls2 ws6">dangerous ideas Christians have. </div><div class="t m0 x4a h36 y1e8 ff12 fs3 fc3 sc0 ls2 wsb7">The father tried talking to his son. When that didn’t work, he yelled; </div><div class="t m0 x5f h36 y1e9 ff12 fs3 fc3 sc0 ls2 ws80">then he beat his son. But the young man refused to give up his new faith </div><div class="t m0 x5f h36 y1ea ff12 fs3 fc3 sc0 ls2 ws70">in Christ. His father knew if he kept on beating his son, he would soon kill </div><div class="t m0 x5f h36 y1eb ff12 fs3 fc3 sc0 ls2 ws6">him. And what good would that do? </div><div class="t m0 x4a h36 y1ec ff12 fs3 fc3 sc0 ls2 ws55">Then the father had an idea. He would kill the pastor instead. It would </div><div class="t m0 x5f h36 y1ed ff12 fs3 fc3 sc0 ls2 wsb8">be worth another prison sentence to save his son from the Christians’ </div><div class="t m0 x5f h36 y1ee ff12 fs3 fc3 sc0 ls2 ws5">heresy. </div><div class="t m0 x4a h36 y1ef ff12 fs3 fc3 sc0 ls2 wsb9">The father staked out the pastor’s house and learned his schedule. He </div><div class="t m0 x5f h36 y1f0 ff12 fs3 fc3 sc0 ls2 ws67">sharpened his long knife.

When the pastor got out of his car to see </div><div class="t m0 x5f h36 y1f3 ff12 fs3 fc3 sc0 ls2 ws5d">what the problem was, the angry father grabbed him and forced him into </div><div class="t m0 x5f h36 y1f4 ff12 fs3 fc3 sc0 ls2 ws6">his own car. </div><div class="t m0 x4a h36 y1f5 ff12 fs3 fc3 sc0 ls2 ws4f">The pastor recognized the man and guessed why he had attacked him. </div><div class="t m0 x5f h36 y1f6 ff12 fs3 fc3 sc0 ls2 wsbb">The pastor tried to share some Bible verses with the man, but the man </div><div class="t m0 x5f h36 y1f7 ff12 fs3 fc3 sc0 ls2 wsbc">yelled at him as he reached for his knife. Suddenly the man’s hand froze <span class="_ _31"></span> </div><div class="t m0 x5f h36 y1f8 ff12 fs3 fc3 sc0 ls2 ws6">in midair; his arm went numb, and he couldn’t move it. </div><div class="t m0 x4a h36 y1f9 ff12 fs3 fc3 sc0 ls2 ws1b">The pastor calmly continued sharing scripture with the man until his </div><div class="t m0 x5f h36 y1fa ff12 fs3 fc3 sc0 ls2 ws6">attacker began to weep. </div><div class="t m0 x4a h36 y1fb ff12 fs3 fc3 sc0 ls2 ws84">A few months later the father was baptized. As the members publicly </div><div class="t m0 x5f h36 y1fc ff12 fs3 fc3 sc0 ls2 ws9e">welcomed him into the church, he asked for the microphone. “I have a </div><div class="t m0 x5f h36 y1fd ff12 fs3 fc3 sc0 ls2 wsba">gift for the pastor,” he said. Carefully he unwrapped the long, sharp knife </div><div class="t m0 x5f h36 y1fe ff12 fs3 fc3 sc0 ls2 ws71">and said, “This is the sword I was going to use to kill you. But you have a </div><div class="t m0 x5f h36 y1ff ff12 fs3 fc3 sc0 ls2 ws31">longer, stronger, sharper sword—a two-edged one, which is the Word of </div><div class="t m0 x5f h36 y200 ff12 fs3 fc3 sc0 ls2 wsbd">God.
