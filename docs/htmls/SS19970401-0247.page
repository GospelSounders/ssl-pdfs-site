His work was </div><div class="t m4aa x8 h23 y604 ff3 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">well known, and he had a flourishing business in Cotonou, the </div><div class="t m4ab x8 h23 y605 ff3 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">capital of Benin, a tiny country in West Africa. Then one day his </div><div class="t m453 x48 h23 y606 ff3 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">right hand was crushed in an accident. His work as a carpenter was </div><div class="t m3d9 x8 h23 y588 ff3 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">over. Sometimes Victor wondered how God could bring victory </div><div class="t m213 x8 h23 y3a0 ff3 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">out of such a loss. </div><div class="t m4ac x22 h23 y607 ff3 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Victor had to support his family, so he returned to his home </div><div class="t m4ad x48 h23 y608 ff3 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">village of Lobogo, a farming region 55 miles north of the capital. </div><div class="t m2d7 x48 h23 y609 ff3 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">His family owned a plot of land there, and he began cultivating it </div><div class="t mc1 x48 h23 y3a4 ff3 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and planted vegetables and nursery stock to sell in the city. </div><div class="t m27e x22 h23 y60a ff3 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">As he traveled back and forth to Lobogo, Victor began to feel a </div><div class="t m471 x48 h23 y60b ff3 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">burden for the people there. Many were relatives and old friends. </div><div class="t m459 x48 h23 y60c ff3 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">There was no one else to share the Adventist message with them. </div><div class="t m156 x48 h23 y60d ff3 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">So Victor began offering his customers Bible studies. In faith, he </div><div class="t m37f x48 h23 y60e ff3 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">bought a field on which to build a church, and painted a little sign </div><div class="t m4ae x48 h23 y60f ff3 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that read &quot;Seventh-day Adventist Church.&quot; He placed it in the </div><div class="t m120 x48 h23 y610 ff3 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">middle of the empty field. </div><div class="t m4af x22 h23 y611 ff3 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">He began spending more and more of his time in Lobogo, and </div><div class="t m4b0 x48 h23 y612 ff3 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">soon he had a group of about 30 people meeting in a temporary </div><div class="t m2d6 x48 h23 y613 ff3 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">shelter to study the Bible. Three young men were ready for bap-</div><div class="t m41c x48 h23 y614 ff3 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tism, and others soon would be ready. But they had no baptistry. </div><div class="t m4b1 x22 h23 y615 ff3 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Victor and the other believers began building a baptismal tank </div><div class="t m491 x48 h23 y616 ff3 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in the empty field. Bit by bit they bought cement and made blocks. </div><div class="t m4b2 x48 h23 y617 ff3 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">They sacrificed to put up a temporary shelter around their bap-</div><div class="t m15 x48 h23 y618 ff3 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tistry. Then they invited a lay evangelist from another area to hold </div><div class="t m15c x48 h23 y619 ff3 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">evangelistic meetings. </div><div class="t m1bf x22 h23 y61a ff3 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">One day a message came to the mission office. &quot;Pastor, come </div><div class="t m163 x48 h23 y61b ff3 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">soon. Eleven people want to be baptized.&quot; The minister arrived </div><div class="t m3c9 x48 h23 y61c ff3 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and interviewed the new believers. Then with great joy he invited </div><div class="t m2cb x25 h23 y61d ff3 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">one after another of the new believers to enter the new baptismal </div><div class="t m4a3 x25 h23 y61e ff3 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tank and seal their commitment to a totally different way of life in </div><div class="t m488 x25 h23 y61f ff3 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Jesus. Faces of new believers shone with joy as they began their </div><div class="t m4b3 x25 h23 y620 ff3 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">new life in Christ, but the most radiant face of all was Victor </div><div class="t mcc x25 h23 y621 ff3 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Kpoto&apos;s.
