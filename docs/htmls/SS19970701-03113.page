Koester </div><div class="t m3a3 x15 h21 yb87 ff4 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Peter thought Christians should not believe in magic. But </div><div class="t m272 x1e h21 yb88 ff4 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">recent events had made him wonder. The pastor where he can-</div><div class="t m183 x21 h21 yb89 ff4 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">vassed invited him to offer prayer for the church service. Peter </div><div class="t m1f0 x21 h21 y710 ff4 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">agreed. But people began to tell him, &quot;You are just a boy; you </div><div class="t m775 x21 h21 yb8a ff4 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">should not pray in the divine service. Go and sit where you </div><div class="t m3a1 x1e h21 yb8b ff4 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">belong.&quot; Others called his willingness to pray in public a sign of </div><div class="t m776 x1e h21 y953 ff4 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">pride and disrespect to his elders. Peter worried about these </div><div class="t mf5 x1e h21 yb8c ff4 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">charges, but he offered the prayer, as the pastor had requested. </div><div class="t m777 x15 h21 yb8d ff4 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The following day Peter rode a bicycle four miles to the </div><div class="t m15f x1e h21 yb8e ff4 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">pastor&apos;s home to pick up some materials. To reach the pastor&apos;s </div><div class="t m305 x1e h21 yb8f ff4 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">house he had to pass through a village notorious for its powerful </div><div class="t m40b x1e h21 y955 ff4 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">magic. As he rode down a hillside past a certain spot on the road, </div><div class="t m303 x1e h21 yb90 ff4 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">suddenly his eyes became so blurred that he could not see. </div><div class="t m1f8 x1e h21 yb91 ff4 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Instantly he prayed that God would help him stop the bicycle </div><div class="t m176 x1e h21 yb92 ff4 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">without injury to himself or the other people walking along the </div><div class="t m1e4 x1e h21 yb93 ff4 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">path. He managed to stop the bicycle and climb off. Trembling, </div><div class="t m596 x1e h21 yb94 ff4 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">he pushed the bicycle the rest of the way to the pastor&apos;s home, </div><div class="t m3c6 x1e h21 yb95 ff4 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">still able to see only dimly. </div><div class="t m183 x15 h21 yb96 ff4 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">To his dismay, the pastor was not home. Peter, his eyes still </div><div class="t m150 x1e h21 y721 ff4 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">blurry, turned and began pushing the bicycle toward home, squinting </div><div class="t m33 x1e h21 yb97 ff4 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and struggling to see the path. Peter suspected that magic had caused </div><div class="t md8 x1e h21 yb98 ff4 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">his near-blindness. As he neared the spot where his eyesight had </div><div class="t m560 x1e h21 y724 ff4 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">become blurry, he stopped and called out loud, &quot;God, You are more </div><div class="t m6f6 x1e h21 yb99 ff4 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">powerful than magic. Send the devil away!&quot; At that instant, his </div><div class="t m778 x1e h21 yb9a ff4 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">eyesight was restored. Then, instead of hurrying away from the place </div><div class="t m3ef x1e h21 yb9b ff4 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">where Satan had attacked him, Peter stepped into the bushes and </div><div class="t m779 x1e h21 yb9c ff4 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">prayed for several minutes, thanking God for the faith to trust in Him </div><div class="t m22e x9 h21 yb9d ff4 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">rather than to fear magic. Then Peter mounted the bicycle and </div><div class="t m19e x1e h21 yb9e ff4 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">continued on his journey. </div><div class="t m135 x1c h21 yb9f ff4 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Peter did not tell others about his encounter with the powers </div><div class="t m55 x9 h21 yba0 ff4 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of evil. He knew that people in this area believed strongly in the </div><div class="t m690 x9 h21 yba1 ff4 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">powers of the devil, which they call magic. His brush with </div><div class="t m216 x9 h21 yba2 ff4 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">blindness would only convince them of the devil&apos;s powers, and </div><div class="t m4d x9 h21 yba3 ff4 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">they would try to fill him with fear of the devil. But when Peter </div><div class="t m77a x9 h21 yba4 ff4 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">returned to school, he shared his story with his close friend. </div><div class="t m1ac x9 h21 yba5 ff4 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Peter admitted that now he knows magic is real, that it is the </div><div class="t m8 x9 h21 yba6 ff4 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">devil&apos;s power. &quot;But&quot;, he added with a smile, &quot;God really is more </div><div class="t m2da x9 h21 yba7 ff4 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">powerful than magic!&quot; </div><div class="t m74e x1c h26 yba8 ff3 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Beverly H.
