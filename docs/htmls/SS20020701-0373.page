I was thrilled </div><div class="t m8e x6d h10 y595 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to find a church with 90 members. Some of the charter members were </div><div class="t m2c1 x6d h10 y53b ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">people to whom I had sold books! Others whom I had met while </div><div class="t m662 x6d h10 y573 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">colporteuring have since been baptized into this church. </div><div class="t m663 x1 h10 y16a ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">One couple I had sold books to lived a wild life. The husband was </div><div class="t m325 x6d h10 y599 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">an alcoholic and a drug addict. I invited them to church and was </div><div class="t m664 x6d h10 y16c ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">surprised when they came. After the service they told me that they had </div><div class="t m50d xd h10 y59a ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">lived together for 10 years, but they wanted to be married. Soon after </div><div class="t m363 x6d h10 y8 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">their marriage they began preparing for baptism. Recently I met this </div><div class="t m665 xd h10 y53c ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">family in church and found a faithful Christian couple. </div><div class="t m386 x1 h10 y579 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I gave Bible studies to a woman named Susan. She wanted to be </div><div class="t m4d2 xd h10 y7e5 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">baptized, but her husband was angry about her decision. On the </div><div class="t m305 xd h10 y59b ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">morning of her baptism, the pastor and I went to pick her up. We found </div><div class="t m2d1 xd h10 y53d ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the husband standing in his yard bare chested and angry. &quot;So you are </div><div class="t m514 xd h10 y57c ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the guy who convinced my wife to become an Adventist!&quot; he roared. </div><div class="t m666 xd h10 y7e6 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The man charged toward us.

The pastor, a judo expert, had flipped him onto the </div><div class="t m5b6 xd h10 y53e ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ground. He was unhurt, but he lay quietly while Susan got into the car. </div><div class="t med x7c h10 y177 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I went to visit Susan and found her happy in her Christian life. </div><div class="t m667 xd h10 y7e7 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">When I asked about her husband, she told me he would soon be home. </div><div class="t m668 xd h10 y179 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I wondered if I should leave, but just then he walked in. </div><div class="t m669 x1 h10 y7e8 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Guess who this is,&quot; Susan said, smiling.
