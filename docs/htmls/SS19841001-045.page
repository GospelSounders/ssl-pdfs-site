Our planet </div><div class="t me5 x78 h20 ydb ff5 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was isolated in rebellion. Its inhabitants had been infected with sin. The </div><div class="t me6 x78 h20 ydc ff5 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">survival of the human race was in doubt. Communication had been </div><div class="t me7 x78 h20 ydd ff5 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">limited, and a great gulf separated human beings from God. An impen-</div><div class="t me8 x78 h20 yde ff5 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">etrable gloom enshrouded the globe. To all appearances the rebels were </div><div class="t me9 x78 h20 ydf ff5 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">without hope, without remedy. </div><div class="t mea x32 h20 ye0 ff5 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">To bridge the gulf a mediator was needed who could provide a way </div><div class="t meb x78 h20 ye1 ff5 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">back to God—someone in between, someone who could bring the es-</div><div class="t mec x78 h20 ye2 ff5 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tranged parties together. In the desperate situation God took the initia-</div><div class="t med x78 h20 ye3 ff5 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tive. Christ was provided as Mediator. He alone had the proper creden-</div><div class="t mee x78 h20 ye4 ff5 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tials and credibility to be able to guarantee results, to speak to both sides </div><div class="t mef x78 h20 ye5 ff5 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and to draw fallen human beings back into fellowship with God. In order </div><div class="t mf0 x78 h20 ye6 ff5 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to do so He had to be willing to pay the price, no matter how high it would </div><div class="t mf1 x79 h20 ye7 ff5 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">be. Being interested in us in a most personal way, He was determined not </div><div class="t mf2 x79 h20 ye8 ff5 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to fail or become discouraged in His intervention on our behalf. </div><div class="t mf3 x32 h20 ye9 ff5 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The Mediator has acted and continues to act in our behalf. Most of His </div><div class="t mf4 x79 h20 yea ff5 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">primary mission has been accomplished. Planet Earth rightfully is His. </div><div class="t mf5 x79 h20 yeb ff5 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The broken relationship has been restored. The communication gulf has </div><div class="t mf6 x79 h20 yec ff5 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">been bridged, the gloom has been lifted, and salvation has been provided </div><div class="t mf7 x79 h20 yed ff5 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">for those willing to accept it. </div><div class="t mf8 x32 h20 yee ff5 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Two more acts in the drama remain—the completion of the investiga-</div><div class="t mf9 x79 h20 yef ff5 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tive judgment and the complete banishment of the instigator, the archen-</div><div class="t mfa x79 h20 yf0 ff5 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">emy, the chief rebel and his followers in the fmal executive judgment. </div><div class="t mfb x79 h20 yf1 ff5 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Annihilation of the root cause will lead to the restoration of the planet to </div><div class="t mfc x79 h20 yf2 ff5 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">what God originally intended it to be. </div><div class="t mfd x32 h20 yf3 ff5 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">For the next thirteen weeks, we will embark on a study journey </div><div class="t mfe x79 h20 yf4 ff5 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">through this grand truth, Jesus our Mediator, and will trace His activity </div><div class="t mff x79 h20 yf5 ff5 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and ministry. We will come to know Him better in the many phases of His </div><div class="t m100 x79 h20 yf6 ff5 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">noble efforts to rescue humanity. We will understand more clearly the </div><div class="t m101 x7a h20 yf7 ff5 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">way God works and come to experience at deeper levels the impact of </div><div class="t m102 x7a h20 yf8 ff5 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">what He has done and what He is doing—of the great salvation He has </div><div class="t m103 x7a h20 yf9 ff5 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">provided. Doing so should enable us to articulate more effectively the </div><div class="t m104 x7a h20 yfa ff5 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">essential meaning of the grand old story. No wonder this teaching has </div><div class="t m105 x7a h20 yfb ff5 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">been called the central doctrine of the Christian faith. It is a key to the </div><div class="t m106 x7a h20 yfc ff5 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">unity of the Bible. In the Mediator, Jesus Christ, God has placed before </div><div class="t m107 x7a h20 yfd ff5 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">His throne our Substitute and Surety. </div><div class="t m108 x2 h20 yfe ff5 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Christianity is a religion of mediation. Ever since the inception of sin, </div><div class="t m109 x7a h20 yff ff5 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Jesus has been and continues to be our Mediator with the Father. His </div><div class="t m10a x59 h20 y100 ff5 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">mediation is our only hope of redemption and restoration. </div><div class="t m10b x2 h20 y101 ff5 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;God is approached through Jesus Christ, the Mediator, the only way </div><div class="t m10c x59 h20 y102 ff5 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">through which He forgives sins. . . . This is the sinner&apos;s only hope, and if </div><div class="t m10d x59 h20 y103 ff5 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">he rests here in sincere faith, he is sure of pardon and that full and free. </div><div class="t m10e x7a h20 y104 ff5 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">There is only one channel and that is accessible to all, and through that </div><div class="t m10f x59 h20 y105 ff5 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">channel a rich and abundant forgiveness awaits the penitent, contrite soul </div><div class="t m110 x59 h20 y2 ff5 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and the darkest sins are forgiven.&quot;—Ellen G.
