With </div><div class="t m4a8 x6e h11 y38e ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the prison administration&apos;s permission, Beatriz arranged with women </div><div class="t m101 x6e h11 y8b5 ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">from an Adventist church an hour from the prison to come and teach </div><div class="t m6c6 x6e h11 y8b6 ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">them about nutrition, household skills, and money management.

The church women began distributing clothes, food, and other </div><div class="t m215 x52 h11 y8bd ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">necessities to these families.
