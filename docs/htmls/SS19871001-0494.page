Esther 9:22. </div><div class="t m170 x18 h19 yaf9 ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The Jews instituted a feast to celebrate their deliverance, calling it Purim. </div><div class="t m6a9 x44 h19 ycf ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The name in itself insults the powers of the pagan deities. Haman, in his </div><div class="t m33c x44 h19 yafa ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">superstition, had wanted to find </div><div class="t m100 x55 h19 yafb ff5 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the </div><div class="t m1a2 x8d h19 yafb ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">perfect day to accomplish his evil pur-</div><div class="t m1bd x44 h19 y89e ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">pose.

Note that it was to be a time of joyous giving and sharing. A loving God </div><div class="t m493 x44 h19 yfe ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">wants even the special occasions we set aside to remember Him to be happy </div><div class="t m12f x44 h19 yff ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ones. </div><div class="t m1b2 x44 h19 y9a3 ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ADDITIONAL BACKGROUND: The modern feast of Purim is one of the </div><div class="t m6af x44 h19 y9a4 ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">highlights of the Jewish religious year. (In the years before the birth of </div><div class="t m16e x44 h19 y103 ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Christ, it was also called Mordecai Day.) As was done in the time of Esther, </div><div class="t m253 x44 h19 y3b0 ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">gifts are given, and there is great rejoicing. </div><div class="t m2a0 x18 h19 y106 ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Purim has many characteristics in common with the Christian celebration </div><div class="t m478 x44 h19 y107 ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of Christmas. Besides gifts for the children, housewives send friends and </div><div class="t m474 x44 h19 y108 ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">relatives platters of food. The people hold special parties and costume balls. </div><div class="t m13b x18 h19 y109 ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The Jewish people gather in the synagogues, where parts or all of the </div><div class="t m36b x44 h19 y9a5 ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">account of Esther is read. Because the name Haman is anathema to the Jews, </div><div class="t m18e x44 h19 y839 ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">a little game is played whereby the reader of the story lets his listeners know </div><div class="t m3fc x44 h19 y3b6 ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">when they are approaching his name. The congregation begins to stamp, </div><div class="t m6b0 x44 h19 y9a6 ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">clap, hiss, boo, and in general make noise because they must not hear the </div><div class="t m6d x44 h19 y10d ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">name when it is read. Normally, traditional Judaism excuses women from </div><div class="t m203 x44 h19 y3bb ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">attending the synagogues because it believes that it is even more important </div><div class="t m5e3 x44 h19 y9a9 ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">for the woman to remain at home to take care of small children. But at </div><div class="t m2d2 x44 h19 yb00 ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Purim, women are obligated to attend because it was through a woman that </div><div class="t m30a x44 h19 y925 ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">deliverance was accomplished for the Jews in Persia. </div><div class="t m37d x18 h19 yb01 ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The festival of Purim has helped the Jews to endure much persecution.
