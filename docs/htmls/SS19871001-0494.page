Esther 9:22. </div><div class="t m170 x17 h17 yaf8 ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The Jews instituted a feast to celebrate their deliverance, calling it Purim. </div><div class="t m6a9 x43 h17 yce ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The name in itself insults the powers of the pagan deities.

Note that it was to be a time of joyous giving and sharing.

(In the years before the birth of </div><div class="t m16e x43 h17 y102 ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Christ, it was also called Mordecai Day.) As was done in the time of Esther, </div><div class="t m253 x43 h17 y3af ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">gifts are given, and there is great rejoicing. </div><div class="t m2a0 x17 h17 y105 ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Purim has many characteristics in common with the Christian celebration </div><div class="t m478 x43 h17 y106 ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of Christmas. Besides gifts for the children, housewives send friends and </div><div class="t m474 x43 h17 y107 ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">relatives platters of food. The people hold special parties and costume balls. </div><div class="t m13b x17 h17 y108 ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The Jewish people gather in the synagogues, where parts or all of the </div><div class="t m36b x43 h17 y9a4 ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">account of Esther is read. Because the name Haman is anathema to the Jews, </div><div class="t m18e x43 h17 y838 ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">a little game is played whereby the reader of the story lets his listeners know </div><div class="t m3fc x43 h17 y3b5 ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">when they are approaching his name. The congregation begins to stamp, </div><div class="t m6b0 x43 h17 y9a5 ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">clap, hiss, boo, and in general make noise because they must not hear the </div><div class="t m6d x43 h17 y10c ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">name when it is read. Normally, traditional Judaism excuses women from </div><div class="t m203 x43 h17 y3ba ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">attending the synagogues because it believes that it is even more important </div><div class="t m5e3 x43 h17 y9a8 ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">for the woman to remain at home to take care of small children. But at </div><div class="t m2d2 x43 h17 yaff ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Purim, women are obligated to attend because it was through a woman that </div><div class="t m30a x43 h17 y924 ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">deliverance was accomplished for the Jews in Persia. </div><div class="t m37d x17 h17 yb00 ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The festival of Purim has helped the Jews to endure much persecution.
