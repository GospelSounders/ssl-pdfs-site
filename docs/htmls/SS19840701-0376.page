The Bible </div><div class="t m1ae x9a h36 y966 ff5 fs1d fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">has much to say about our words and their potential for being a blessing </div><div class="t m42f x9a h36 y6b ff5 fs1d fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">or a curse. There can be no doubt that God intended the ninth command-</div><div class="t m6e7 x9a h36 y967 ff5 fs1d fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ment to embrace the entire sphere of our spoken words. In the light that </div><div class="t m768 x9a h36 y968 ff5 fs1d fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">shines on God&apos;s law from the gospel, it is clear that God intends the </div><div class="t m3f4 x9a h36 y969 ff5 fs1d fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">speech of His people to be not only strictly truthful but also kind, helpful, </div><div class="t m769 x9a h36 y64 ff5 fs1d fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and edifying. Here the thoughts and motives play key roles. Of Jesus, the </div><div class="t m71 x9a h36 y96a ff5 fs1d fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">prophet says, &quot;He will magnify the law, and make it honourable&quot; (Isa. </div><div class="t m420 x9a h36 y96b ff5 fs1d fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">42:21). This applies to those aspects of God&apos;s law of love that govern our </div><div class="t m1f6 x9a h36 y96c ff5 fs1d fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">conversation in all spheres of our daily lives. </div><div class="t m76a x8e h36 y96d ff5 fs1d fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">If, as we believe, it is out of the heart that the mouth speaketh (see </div><div class="t m63c x9a h36 y96e ff5 fs1d fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Luke 6:45), then it is the thought that is father to the word. The motive—</div><div class="t m76b x9a h36 y96f ff5 fs1d fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the underlying reason for what we do—likewise influences both the </div><div class="t m46d x9a h36 y970 ff5 fs1d fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">thought and the word.
