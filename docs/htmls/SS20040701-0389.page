He let his peers influence his </div><div class="t m243 x4 h6 y871 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">decisions and began smoking and taking drugs. He experimented with </div><div class="t m8a x4 h6 y188 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">every drug he could get, and often he grew weak because he was not eat-</div><div class="t m101 x4 h6 y18a ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ing. Drugs were all he cared for. </div><div class="t mbf x3c h6 y872 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Solomon and his friends were always together, smoking and taking </div><div class="t m341 x4 h6 y873 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">drugs. They formed a gang and often fought with other teens. Once when </div><div class="t m577 x4 h6 y874 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">he was high on drugs, he picked up a machete, ready to strike his father. </div><div class="t m655 x4 h6 y875 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">But a voice shouted to him, &quot;Stop!&quot; and he dropped the machete as if it </div><div class="t m421 x4 h6 y876 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">were on fire. </div><div class="t m4df x3c h6 y877 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Help me, please!&quot; he cried. His family took him to a mental hospital </div><div class="t m104 x4 h6 y18c ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">for treatment. But the hospital kept him for only a few days. </div><div class="t m172 x3c h6 y18d ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Solomon&apos;s grandmother prayed for him constantly and encouraged him </div><div class="t m637 x4 h6 y18e ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to attend church with her and let God heal him. Solomon went, and there </div><div class="t m1fd x4 h6 y39f ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">he felt God&apos;s love calling him. But he continued taking drugs for ten more </div><div class="t m577 x4 h6 y190 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">years. Then Solomon&apos;s grandmother and his father died. The two people </div><div class="t m32b x4 h6 y191 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">who had tried to help him were gone. Finally Solomon could run away </div><div class="t m12e x4 h6 y192 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">from God no longer. He gave up and gave his life to God. It had taken him </div><div class="t m376 x4 h6 y193 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">years to heed the voice of God. </div><div class="t m431 x51 h6 y194 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Solomon did not know which church to attend. He tried several before </div><div class="t m304 x25 h6 y196 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">he visited an Adventist church. There he watched the pastor baptize some-</div><div class="t m39f x4 h6 y878 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">one, and instantly he knew what he must do. He went to the pastor and </div><div class="t m8c x25 h6 y197 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">asked for baptism. The pastor reviewed the doctrines with him and bap-</div><div class="t m16c x25 h6 y879 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tized Solomon. </div><div class="t m376 x51 h6 y199 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Solomon&apos;s repentance was real. He serves his church and his God with </div><div class="t m656 x25 h6 y87a ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">joy and faithfulness as a deacon and an elder.
