He let his peers influence his </div><div class="t m243 x5 h8 y872 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">decisions and began smoking and taking drugs. He experimented with </div><div class="t m8a x5 h8 y189 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">every drug he could get, and often he grew weak because he was not eat-</div><div class="t m101 x5 h8 y18b ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ing. Drugs were all he cared for. </div><div class="t mbf x3d h8 y873 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Solomon and his friends were always together, smoking and taking </div><div class="t m341 x5 h8 y874 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">drugs. They formed a gang and often fought with other teens. Once when </div><div class="t m577 x5 h8 y875 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">he was high on drugs, he picked up a machete, ready to strike his father. </div><div class="t m655 x5 h8 y876 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">But a voice shouted to him, &quot;Stop!&quot; and he dropped the machete as if it </div><div class="t m421 x5 h8 y877 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">were on fire. </div><div class="t m4df x3d h8 y878 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Help me, please!&quot; he cried. His family took him to a mental hospital </div><div class="t m104 x5 h8 y18d ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">for treatment. But the hospital kept him for only a few days. </div><div class="t m172 x3d h8 y18e ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Solomon&apos;s grandmother prayed for him constantly and encouraged him </div><div class="t m637 x5 h8 y18f ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to attend church with her and let God heal him. Solomon went, and there </div><div class="t m1fd x5 h8 y3a0 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">he felt God&apos;s love calling him. But he continued taking drugs for ten more </div><div class="t m577 x5 h8 y191 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">years. Then Solomon&apos;s grandmother and his father died. The two people </div><div class="t m32b x5 h8 y192 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">who had tried to help him were gone. Finally Solomon could run away </div><div class="t m12e x5 h8 y193 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">from God no longer. He gave up and gave his life to God. It had taken him </div><div class="t m376 x5 h8 y194 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">years to heed the voice of God. </div><div class="t m431 x52 h8 y195 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Solomon did not know which church to attend. He tried several before </div><div class="t m304 x26 h8 y197 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">he visited an Adventist church. There he watched the pastor baptize some-</div><div class="t m39f x5 h8 y879 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">one, and instantly he knew what he must do. He went to the pastor and </div><div class="t m8c x26 h8 y198 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">asked for baptism. The pastor reviewed the doctrines with him and bap-</div><div class="t m16c x26 h8 y87a ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tized Solomon. </div><div class="t m376 x52 h8 y19a ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Solomon&apos;s repentance was real.
