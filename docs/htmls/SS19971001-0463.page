Thus it is no surprise that after sin entered the </div><div class="t m52d x43 h9 y424 ff3 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">world, one of Satan&apos;s most concerted attacks focused on the Sabbath. If </div><div class="t m339 x43 h9 y7d1 ff3 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">he could take this day of love and undermine it, he would be able to </div><div class="t m52e x43 h9 y426 ff3 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">achieve in the spiritual realm what he had already achieved in the </div><div class="t m322 x43 h9 y427 ff3 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">physical realm. Just as a perfume-laden rose now carries thorns on its </div><div class="t m456 x43 h9 y428 ff3 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">stem, Satan sought to place thorns on the stem of the Sabbath rose. These </div><div class="t m52f x43 h9 y42a ff3 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;thorns&quot; placed on the Sabbath came from well-meaning people who </div><div class="t m483 x43 h9 y7d2 ff3 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">said they were acting to protect the sanctity of Sabbath. But Jesus chose </div><div class="t m530 x43 h9 y7d3 ff3 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to challenge their approach to Sabbath keeping through healing miracles. </div><div class="t m17d x46 h14 y42e ff2 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Before one Sabbath miracle, Jesus gave the reasons for His </div><div class="t m14a x1c h14 y7d4 ff2 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">reformation of Sabbath keeping as practiced by the Pharisees. </div><div class="t m2b3 x1c h14 y430 ff2 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Identify His two reasons.

While they believed you could seek to prevent the loss of </div><div class="t m1ee x1c h9 y7d9 ff3 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">life, they opposed the promotion of healing. In other words, if your </div><div class="t m532 x1c h9 y7da ff3 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">hand or wrist were cut and bleeding, you could stop the bleeding, </div><div class="t m533 x1c h9 y7db ff3 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">because it was a threat to life.
