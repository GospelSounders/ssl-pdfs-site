Just as a perfume-laden rose now carries thorns on its </div><div class="t m456 x43 hb y429 ff3 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">stem, Satan sought to place thorns on the stem of the Sabbath rose. These </div><div class="t m52f x43 hb y42b ff3 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;thorns&quot; placed on the Sabbath came from well-meaning people who </div><div class="t m483 x43 hb y7d3 ff3 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">said they were acting to protect the sanctity of Sabbath. But Jesus chose </div><div class="t m530 x43 hb y7d4 ff3 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to challenge their approach to Sabbath keeping through healing miracles. </div><div class="t m17d x46 h17 y42f ff2 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Before one Sabbath miracle, Jesus gave the reasons for His </div><div class="t m14a x1d h17 y7d5 ff2 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">reformation of Sabbath keeping as practiced by the Pharisees. </div><div class="t m2b3 x1d h17 y431 ff2 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Identify His two reasons.
