For </div><div class="t ma2 x3f ha y93 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Daniel, the end wasn&apos;t found within humans themselves as some natural </div><div class="t ma3 x3f ha y94 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">result of who and what they were; instead, the end was something brought </div><div class="t ma4 x3f ha y95 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">about by the supernatural intervention of an all-knowing, all-powerful God </div><div class="t ma5 x3f ha y96 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">who promised that &quot;the end&quot;—meaning the end of this world—was, in fact, </div><div class="t ma6 x3f ha y97 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the beginning of a new one.
