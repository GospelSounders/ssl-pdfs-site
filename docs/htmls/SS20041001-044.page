For </div><div class="t ma2 x3e h8 y92 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Daniel, the end wasn&apos;t found within humans themselves as some natural </div><div class="t ma3 x3e h8 y93 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">result of who and what they were; instead, the end was something brought </div><div class="t ma4 x3e h8 y94 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">about by the supernatural intervention of an all-knowing, all-powerful God </div><div class="t ma5 x3e h8 y95 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">who promised that &quot;the end&quot;—meaning the end of this world—was, in fact, </div><div class="t ma6 x3e h8 y96 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the beginning of a new one. In short, while Aristotle looked within human-</div><div class="t mc x3e h8 y97 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ity for its end, Daniel (as do all the Bible writers) puts the end in something </div><div class="t ma7 x3e h8 y98 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that transcends humanity, and that is the God who first created humanity. </div><div class="t ma8 x3f h8 y99 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">How thankful we should be, too, because if our &quot;end,&quot; our purpose, were </div><div class="t ma9 x3e h8 y9a ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">limited only to ourselves, it hardly seems worth the effort to reach that end. </div><div class="t maa x3e h8 y9b ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Why expend all the energy and pain of eking out an existence here, only to </div><div class="t mab x3e h8 y9c ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">have it all culminate in death?
