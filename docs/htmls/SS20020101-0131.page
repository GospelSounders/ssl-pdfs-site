From childhood </div><div class="t m380 x1e h10 y288 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Lamine had memorized large portions of the Qu&apos;ran. But as he ma-</div><div class="t m381 x1e h10 y289 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tured, he became discouraged over the uncertainties of life. He wished </div><div class="t m382 x1e h10 y42 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">for a deeper spiritual experience, but he did not know how to achieve it. </div><div class="t m383 x1e h10 y28a ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Then he met Pastor Patinde, the first Christian pastor Lamine had ever </div><div class="t m35f x1e h10 y28b ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">known. </div><div class="t m384 x92 h10 y28c ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Religion should be a joy,&quot; Lamine told Patinde. &quot;So why is it such </div><div class="t m385 x1e h10 y28d ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">a burden? Why is there so much fear and hatred, so much killing?&quot; </div><div class="t m169 x1f h10 y28e ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The youthful pastor and the imam&apos;s son talked for some time. As </div><div class="t m29a x1e h10 y28f ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the two discussed spiritual issues and prayed together, Lamine caught a </div><div class="t m386 x1e h10 y291 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">new glimpse of God. Patinde gave Lamine a Bible, and Lamine began </div><div class="t m32c x1e h10 y3dd ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to read it. He was amazed that it contained some stories found in the </div><div class="t m387 x1e h10 y292 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Qu&apos;ran. </div><div class="t m388 x1f h10 y293 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">When Lamine read in the Qu&apos;ran that a true believer should read the </div><div class="t m389 x13 h10 y3de ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">prophets, the Gospels, and other writings of the Bible, he felt that he </div><div class="t m365 x1e h10 y3df ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was following the counsel of Mohammed, Islam&apos;s prophet. As he </div><div class="t m38a x13 h10 y2bb ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">continued studying the Bible, his burden was replaced with joy. He felt </div><div class="t m38b x1e h10 y3e0 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">a peace he had never known. </div><div class="t m38c x12 h10 y3e1 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Lamine had to be careful that no one saw him enter or leave the </div><div class="t m2e5 x13 h10 y3e2 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">pastor&apos;s home.
