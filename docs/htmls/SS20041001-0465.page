He had been working in </div><div class="t m651 x35 h2 y2f1 ff3 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">southern China for several months without any apparent success, in spite </div><div class="t m54c x35 h2 y777 ff3 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of his best efforts. </div><div class="t m652 x19 h2 y673 ff3 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Then one day Brother Lee was involved in a serious accident that also </div><div class="t m653 x35 h2 y2f4 ff3 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">involved another man. Both victims were sent to the hospital and placed </div><div class="t m600 x35 h2 y24c ff3 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in the same room. During their lengthy recuperation Brother Lee had </div><div class="t m11d x35 h2 y778 ff3 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">plenty of time to become acquainted with his roommate. By the time the </div><div class="t mc8 x35 h2 y2f6 ff3 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">men were released from the hospital, the two men had become good </div><div class="t m654 x35 h2 y779 ff3 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">friends, and Brother Lee had led his roommate to accept Jesus as his Lord </div><div class="t m655 x35 h2 y2f7 ff3 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and Savior. In fact, the two men decided to work together for God. </div><div class="t m14f x81 h2 y675 ff3 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Brother Lee learned that his new friend&apos;s wife had been paralyzed by a </div><div class="t m656 x35 h2 y77a ff3 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">stroke and was confined to their home. She could not walk or take care of </div><div class="t m3e6 x35 h2 y77b ff3 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">herself. Brother Lee asked a kind Adventist woman to visit this man&apos;s </div><div class="t m657 x20 h2 y77c ff3 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">wife. The Adventist woman gave her massage and other natural treat-</div><div class="t m658 x20 h2 y6e4 ff3 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ments. Before long the woman could stand and move slowly around using </div><div class="t m5c5 x20 h2 y508 ff3 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">a cane. </div><div class="t m187 x81 h2 y2fd ff3 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">This woman&apos;s healing created interest in knowing more about God, and </div><div class="t m659 x20 h2 y77d ff3 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">before long several people were meeting in a small group with Brother </div><div class="t m65a x20 h2 y77e ff3 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Lee. They meet for worship in a small room that they have rented. The lit-</div><div class="t m65b x20 h2 y77f ff3 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tle group is growing. </div><div class="t m65c x0 h2 y6e6 ff3 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Brother Lee is happy that the Lord has used an unfortunate situation to </div><div class="t m324 x20 h2 y780 ff3 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">bring him in contact with someone whose heart was searching for a better </div><div class="t m655 x20 h2 y781 ff3 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">life. Through this unfortunate incident God continues to work in the lives </div><div class="t m65d x20 h2 y782 ff3 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of this family. Even his friend&apos;s mother-in-law, a lifelong Buddhist, began </div><div class="t m65e x20 h2 ye5 ff3 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">warming to the gospel as she saw the power of God to heal her daughter. </div><div class="t m65f x0 h2 y646 ff3 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The wife&apos;s healing continued through patient massage and natural treat-</div><div class="t m660 x20 h2 y3bd ff3 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ments, and eventually she was able to throw away her cane and even </div><div class="t m661 x20 h2 y783 ff3 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">resume working.
