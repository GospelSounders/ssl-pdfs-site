Paul made this abundantly clear in </div><div class="t m1a5 x46 h1d yb43 ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Galatians 2 and 3 and in Romans 3 through 6.

(See Col. 2:10; </div><div class="t m75 x46 h1d yb46 ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">1 Cor. 1:30; 6:11.) Holiness is sanctification.

The Bible teaches that no unholy person will go to </div><div class="t m13 x46 h1d yb49 ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">heaven. (See Heb. 12:14.) But Jesus promised the dying thief that he would </div><div class="t m5f x46 h1d y218 ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">be in heaven. (See Luke 23:43.) When the thief trusted Christ, he was both </div><div class="t m439 x46 h1d yb4a ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">justified and holy in Christ.

(See Rom. 6:17, </div><div class="t m583 x22 h1d yb5f ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">18.) This is not an experience that occurs once in a Christian life.
