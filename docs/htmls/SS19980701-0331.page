The </div><div class="t m352 x2a hb y17e ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">earnest young man was looking for an Adventist church, so I invited </div><div class="t m353 x2a hb y17f ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">him to evangelistic meetings that evening. </div><div class="t m354 x2d hb y3b4 ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I arrived at the meeting hall early, and found Sidraque already </div><div class="t m31 x2a hb y23c ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">waiting. We sat together during the meeting, and afterward I invited </div><div class="t m17e x2a hb y180 ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">him to study the Bible with me and see for himself if the Adventist </div><div class="t m1a4 x2a hb y23e ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">church taught the truth. He readily agreed. I gave him some Bible </div><div class="t m355 x2a hb y182 ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">study guides and invited him to come again the next night. </div><div class="t m315 x2d hb y183 ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The following evening he brought three cousins with him to the </div><div class="t m356 x2a hb y133 ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">evangelistic meeting. After the meeting all four young men stayed to </div><div class="t m357 xb hb y184 ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">review the Bible lesson I had given Sidraque the night before. It took </div><div class="t m2cf x2a hb y186 ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">a long time to cover each lesson, for Sidraque had many questions. </div><div class="t m358 xb hb y3b5 ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">He wanted to understand everything! </div><div class="t m359 x2d hb y3b6 ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">When we studied the lessons on the Ten Commandments and the </div><div class="t m35a xb hb y188 ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Sabbath, Sidraque hesitated. He was convinced that the Sabbath was </div><div class="t m353 xb hb y189 ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">God&apos;s holy day, but some of his classes at the military school met on </div><div class="t m313 xb hb y18a ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Saturdays, and he could not let his family down. They expected him </div><div class="t m35b xb hb y3b7 ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to do well, become a professional soldier, and bring honor to the </div><div class="t m18d xb hb y3b8 ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">family. And even though his father knew Sabbath was special, he did </div><div class="t m17e xb hb y3b9 ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">not know how to keep it. Sidraque was not sure what to do; he was </div><div class="t m35c xb hb y3ba ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">not ready to give up his dream of becoming a soldier. </div><div class="t m24a x22 hb y3bb ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Not long after this he asked me if an Adventist could become a </div><div class="t m327 xb hb yf3 ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">soldier. I told him, &quot;I know Adventists who are soldiers in the army, </div><div class="t m7b xb hb yf4 ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">but they have difficulties keeping the Sabbath.&quot; </div><div class="t m20a x22 hb y3bc ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">After one Bible study Sidraque asked me how he could learn to </div><div class="t m35d xb hb yf6 ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tell others what he was learning from the Bible. He paused, then </div><div class="t m1dc xb hb yf7 ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">asked, &quot;What do I do to become a preacher?&quot; I explained that he </div><div class="t m35e xb hb y3bd ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">would have to study theology for four years to become a minister. </div><div class="t m16d x22 hb yf8 ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Not long after that, Sidraque announced, &quot;I have decided to quit </div><div class="t m35f x2b hb y3be ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">my military studies.
