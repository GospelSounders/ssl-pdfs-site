I learned to fight, to trust no one, to rely only on </div><div class="t mca x15 h18 y990 ff5 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">myself. The guerrillas carried on their hit-and-run warfare from </div><div class="t m30a x9 h18 y991 ff5 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">hiding places in the forested mountains of the central Philippines. </div><div class="t m43d x9 h18 y992 ff5 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Violence dominated our lives; killing had little meaning. Eventually </div><div class="t m144 x9 h18 y918 ff5 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I became commander of the guerrillas in the National People&apos;s Army. </div><div class="t mc8 x9 h18 y919 ff5 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Religion had no part in my life. I thought God was for the weak; I </div><div class="t m2a4 x9 h18 y993 ff5 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was strong and fearless. </div><div class="t m114 x2a h18 y994 ff5 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">One Sunday we walked into a church, machine guns loaded, and </div><div class="t m4e3 x9 h18 y91c ff5 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">forced the congregation stand along the church&apos;s aisle and place their </div><div class="t m636 x9 h18 y995 ff5 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Bibles on the floor. Then we made them walk on their Bibles and </div><div class="t m1eb x9 h18 y996 ff5 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">leave the church. Shoving a gun at the pastor, we ordered him to lead </div><div class="t m41a x9 h18 y997 ff5 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the way, and the congregation followed. The people scattered like </div><div class="t m21e x9 h18 y998 ff5 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">bats as they stepped outside the church. What a sight to see these </div><div class="t m123 x9 h18 y999 ff5 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">poor people run for their lives! </div><div class="t m4c x2a h18 y99a ff5 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">But I heard a sound inside the church and saw an old woman lying </div><div class="t m38b x9 h18 y99b ff5 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">under one of the pews, sobbing and clutching her Bible to her chest. I </div><div class="t m41f x9 h18 y99c ff5 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ordered her to get up and leave, but she would not go. Her refusal </div><div class="t m433 x9 h18 y99d ff5 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">irritated me, and I pointed the barrel of my gun at her chest. Still she </div><div class="t m4e0 x9 h18 y99e ff5 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">would not move.

Eventually I was captured </div><div class="t m10f x9 h18 y9a1 ff5 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and charged with rebellion against the government and murder. I was </div><div class="t m4fe x9 h18 y9a2 ff5 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sentenced to death for killing 282 people. </div><div class="t m671 xa h18 y9a3 ff5 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">With two other men I stood before a firing squad at the edge of a </div><div class="t m55b x9 h18 y6bc ff5 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">freshly dug ditch.
