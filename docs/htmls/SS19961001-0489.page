I learned to fight, to trust no one, to rely only on </div><div class="t mca x16 h1b y991 ff5 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">myself. The guerrillas carried on their hit-and-run warfare from </div><div class="t m30a xa h1b y992 ff5 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">hiding places in the forested mountains of the central Philippines. </div><div class="t m43d xa h1b y993 ff5 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Violence dominated our lives; killing had little meaning.

Then we made them walk on their Bibles and </div><div class="t m1eb xa h1b y997 ff5 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">leave the church. Shoving a gun at the pastor, we ordered him to lead </div><div class="t m41a xa h1b y998 ff5 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the way, and the congregation followed. The people scattered like </div><div class="t m21e xa h1b y999 ff5 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">bats as they stepped outside the church.

Her refusal </div><div class="t m433 xa h1b y99e ff5 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">irritated me, and I pointed the barrel of my gun at her chest.
