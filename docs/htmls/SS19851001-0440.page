The apostle&apos;s use of the same word in connection </div><div class="t m2c6 x3c h1f y603 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">with the giving of prophecy suggests that the Holy Spirit came upon the </div><div class="t m4cb x3c h1f y604 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">prophets with a driving force, giving them their message from God that </div><div class="t m15c x3c h1f y605 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">they in turn felt impelled by a force outside themselves to pass on to their </div><div class="t m4e7 x3c h1f y606 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">people. The entire final phrase of verse 21 might then be translated: &quot;To </div><div class="t m30f x3c h1f y607 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the contrary, impelled by the Holy Spirit men spoke from God.&quot; There is </div><div class="t m64 x3c h1f y608 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">no word &quot;holy&quot; attached to &quot;men&quot; in the original, and the words &quot;from </div><div class="t m4e8 x3c h1f y609 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">God&quot; refer not so much to the prophets as to the message that God gave </div><div class="t m3bf x3c h1f y60a ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">them to share with His people. </div><div class="t m4e9 x3b h1f y60b ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The same concluding phrase throws light on the way that inspiration </div><div class="t m35a x3c h1f y60c ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">worked on the prophet. The messenger believed himself to be God&apos;s in-</div><div class="t m281 x3c h1f y60d ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">strument. He did not create the message; it was given him by God, and it </div><div class="t m3a0 x3c h1f y60e ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was his mission to share it with those for whom the Lord intended it. But </div><div class="t m4ea x3c h1f y60f ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the prophet expressed that message in his own words, in language that </div><div class="t m4eb x3c h1f y610 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was best suited to his audience or readership. The message passed </div><div class="t m2f x3c h1f y611 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">through the mechanism of his own mind and personality and bore the </div><div class="t m59 x3c h1f y612 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">impress of his own individuality. That process gives us the vastly differing </div><div class="t m316 x3c h1f y613 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">styles of Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Ezekiel, although each prophet delivered </div><div class="t m48f x3c h1f y614 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">messages that were given directly by the Holy Spirit. </div><div class="t mb6 x3b h20 y615 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">What additional light does Paul throw on the way inspiration works? </div><div class="t m4ec x3c h20 y616 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">2 Tim. 3:16. </div><div class="t m28b x3c h20 y9 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ILLUMINATION: </div><div class="t m4ed x37 h1f y617 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;The union of the divine and human, manifest in </div><div class="t m196 x3c h1f y618 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Christ, exists also in the Bible.
