In the last verse of the prologue (verse 18), John says </div><div class="t mfd x46 h13 y14f ff5 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that the Word &quot;is at the Father&apos;s side&quot; (NIV).

Rather, John&apos;s phrase conveys the idea that Jesus is of </div><div class="t m151 x46 h13 y158 ff5 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the very essence and quality of God—that He is divine. </div><div class="t m152 x45 h14 y159 ff1 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">SEARCH AND LEARN: Jesus has existed forever with the Father and is </div><div class="t m153 x45 h14 y15a ff1 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">just as fully God as is the Father.

Because of the heresy known as Gnosticism that had arisen during </div><div class="t m15c x46 h13 y160 ff5 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">his lifetime, it was vital for John to connect Jesus definitely with the work </div><div class="t m15d x46 h13 y161 ff5 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of creation. </div><div class="t m15e x8 h13 y162 ff5 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The promoters of Gnosticism believed themselves to possess advanced </div><div class="t m15f x46 h13 y163 ff5 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and secret knowledge. They taught that in the beginning only two things </div><div class="t m160 x46 h13 y164 ff5 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">existed—God and matter. God, they said, was pure spirit, while matter </div><div class="t m161 x46 h13 y165 ff5 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was flawed and evil. To a Gnostic it was inconceivable that a pure and </div><div class="t m162 x46 h13 y166 ff5 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">holy God should ever touch polluted matter. Therefore God could not </div><div class="t m86 x46 h13 y6 ff5 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">possibly have carried out the work of creation Himself. </div><div class="t mf x8 h13 y167 ff5 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">In eternity past, they said, He put out from Himself a series of what are </div><div class="t m163 x46 h13 y168 ff5 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">called &quot;emanations.&quot; Each emanation (a kind of radiation) was farther </div><div class="t m164 x45 h13 y169 ff5 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and farther away from Him. As time passed, the emanations knew less </div><div class="t m165 x45 h13 y16a ff5 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and less about Him. About halfway down the series of emanations one </div><div class="t m166 x45 h13 y16b ff5 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">came along that finally knew nothing at all about God. After that the </div><div class="t m167 x46 h13 y16c ff5 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">emanations began to be not only ignorant of God, but hostile to Him. </div><div class="t m168 x49 h13 y16d ff5 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">At &apos;last there came an emanation that was so distant from God that it </div><div class="t m169 x46 h13 y16e ff5 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was both totally ignorant of Him and totally hostile to the very idea of </div><div class="t m16a x46 h13 y72 ff5 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Him. This emanation (known as the demiurge), the Gnostics taught, was </div><div class="t mda x46 h13 y16f ff5 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the power that created the world, because it was so distant from Him that </div><div class="t mdb x46 h13 y170 ff5 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">it could touch flawed and evil matter. </div><div class="t m16b x49 h13 y171 ff5 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Against both the Gnosticism of John&apos;s day and the evolutionary theor-</div><div class="t m30 x46 h13 y172 ff5 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ies of our time stands John&apos;s bold claim that this world was created by </div><div class="t m102 x45 h13 y173 ff5 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">God the Word—Jesus Christ Himself. </div><div class="t m16c x49 h13 y174 ff5 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">A child who had known only the streets and walls of a large city was </div><div class="t m16d x45 h13 y16 ff5 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">taken to the countryside for an outing.
