Because of the heresy known as Gnosticism that had arisen during </div><div class="t m15c x47 h16 y161 ff5 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">his lifetime, it was vital for John to connect Jesus definitely with the work </div><div class="t m15d x47 h16 y162 ff5 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of creation. </div><div class="t m15e x9 h16 y163 ff5 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The promoters of Gnosticism believed themselves to possess advanced </div><div class="t m15f x47 h16 y164 ff5 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and secret knowledge. They taught that in the beginning only two things </div><div class="t m160 x47 h16 y165 ff5 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">existed—God and matter. God, they said, was pure spirit, while matter </div><div class="t m161 x47 h16 y166 ff5 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was flawed and evil. To a Gnostic it was inconceivable that a pure and </div><div class="t m162 x47 h16 y167 ff5 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">holy God should ever touch polluted matter. Therefore God could not </div><div class="t m86 x47 h16 y7 ff5 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">possibly have carried out the work of creation Himself. </div><div class="t mf x9 h16 y168 ff5 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">In eternity past, they said, He put out from Himself a series of what are </div><div class="t m163 x47 h16 y169 ff5 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">called &quot;emanations.&quot; Each emanation (a kind of radiation) was farther </div><div class="t m164 x46 h16 y16a ff5 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and farther away from Him. As time passed, the emanations knew less </div><div class="t m165 x46 h16 y16b ff5 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and less about Him. About halfway down the series of emanations one </div><div class="t m166 x46 h16 y16c ff5 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">came along that finally knew nothing at all about God. After that the </div><div class="t m167 x47 h16 y16d ff5 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">emanations began to be not only ignorant of God, but hostile to Him. </div><div class="t m168 x4a h16 y16e ff5 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">At &apos;last there came an emanation that was so distant from God that it </div><div class="t m169 x47 h16 y16f ff5 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was both totally ignorant of Him and totally hostile to the very idea of </div><div class="t m16a x47 h16 y73 ff5 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Him. This emanation (known as the demiurge), the Gnostics taught, was </div><div class="t mda x47 h16 y170 ff5 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the power that created the world, because it was so distant from Him that </div><div class="t mdb x47 h16 y171 ff5 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">it could touch flawed and evil matter. </div><div class="t m16b x4a h16 y172 ff5 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Against both the Gnosticism of John&apos;s day and the evolutionary theor-</div><div class="t m30 x47 h16 y173 ff5 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ies of our time stands John&apos;s bold claim that this world was created by </div><div class="t m102 x46 h16 y174 ff5 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">God the Word—Jesus Christ Himself. </div><div class="t m16c x4a h16 y175 ff5 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">A child who had known only the streets and walls of a large city was </div><div class="t m16d x46 h16 y17 ff5 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">taken to the countryside for an outing.
