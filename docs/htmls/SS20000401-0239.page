But </div><div class="t m304 x1a hc y275 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">first God would need to chase away the spirit that lived there </div><div class="t m2be x1a hc y3e ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">before they could build. The group prayed, the spirit left, and the </div><div class="t m43d x1a hc y4be ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">believers built a simple thatch church. They tried to get permis-</div><div class="t me5 x1a hc y276 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sion from the local government to build a permanent church, but </div><div class="t m43e x1a hc y178 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">one official steadfastly refused to allow a Christian church in his </div><div class="t mfa x1a hc y10b ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">area.

When the dictrict official told a Christian that </div><div class="t m3b8 x1a hc y19 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">he had not eaten that day, the Christian gave him 10 pounds of </div><div class="t m43f x1a hc y17b ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">rice from his own meager store. &quot;If that&apos;s the kind of people </div><div class="t m12c x1a hc y110 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Christians are,&quot; he said, &quot;you are welcome in my community.&quot; </div><div class="t m1c7 x1e hc y17c ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The floodwaters receded, and the villagers could plant their </div><div class="t m10e x1a hc y17d ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">crops. The rice grew quickly in the fertile soil. But one day cut-</div><div class="t m440 x1a hc y278 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">worms invaded the area. They ate the tender roots of the rice </div><div class="t m441 x1a hc y4bf ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">plants, killing them. The villagers tried flooding the fields to </div><div class="t m1b8 x1a hc y21a ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">drown the worms, and pesticides to kill them, but nothing worked. </div><div class="t m1b6 x50 hc y180 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">In days the once-green rice fields looked dry and brown. That is, </div><div class="t m364 x1a hc y42c ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">all except for those belonging to Mr. Eae.
