But </div><div class="t m304 x19 ha y274 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">first God would need to chase away the spirit that lived there </div><div class="t m2be x19 ha y3d ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">before they could build. The group prayed, the spirit left, and the </div><div class="t m43d x19 ha y4bd ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">believers built a simple thatch church. They tried to get permis-</div><div class="t me5 x19 ha y275 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sion from the local government to build a permanent church, but </div><div class="t m43e x19 ha y177 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">one official steadfastly refused to allow a Christian church in his </div><div class="t mfa x19 ha y10a ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">area. Without his permission, the believers could not build. </div><div class="t m1bd x1d ha y179 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The yearly rains brought severe flooding to the area, and people </div><div class="t m2c6 x19 ha y43 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">were going hungry. When the dictrict official told a Christian that </div><div class="t m3b8 x19 ha y18 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">he had not eaten that day, the Christian gave him 10 pounds of </div><div class="t m43f x19 ha y17a ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">rice from his own meager store. &quot;If that&apos;s the kind of people </div><div class="t m12c x19 ha y10f ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Christians are,&quot; he said, &quot;you are welcome in my community.&quot; </div><div class="t m1c7 x1d ha y17b ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The floodwaters receded, and the villagers could plant their </div><div class="t m10e x19 ha y17c ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">crops. The rice grew quickly in the fertile soil. But one day cut-</div><div class="t m440 x19 ha y277 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">worms invaded the area. They ate the tender roots of the rice </div><div class="t m441 x19 ha y4be ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">plants, killing them. The villagers tried flooding the fields to </div><div class="t m1b8 x19 ha y219 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">drown the worms, and pesticides to kill them, but nothing worked. </div><div class="t m1b6 x4f ha y17f ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">In days the once-green rice fields looked dry and brown. That is, </div><div class="t m364 x19 ha y42b ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">all except for those belonging to Mr. Eae.
