The guilty </div><div class="t m443 xc1 h14 y18c ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">person is caught and convicted. Before sentencing, the court </div><div class="t m275 x2d h14 y3c8 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">wants to hear from the victim; depending upon what she says, </div><div class="t m4c1 x77 h14 y18d ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">his sentence can be lenient or very harsh.

Does </div><div class="t m274 x47 h12 y282 ff3 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">she ask that he be given the lightest sentence possible?
