The guilty </div><div class="t m443 xc1 h11 y18b ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">person is caught and convicted. Before sentencing, the court </div><div class="t m275 x2c h11 y3c7 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">wants to hear from the victim; depending upon what she says, </div><div class="t m4c1 x76 h11 y18c ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">his sentence can be lenient or very harsh. It&apos;s up to her. </div><div class="t m22d x3a h11 y18d ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Now, the victim is a Christian, who feels under the conviction of </div><div class="t m7d x76 h11 y470 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the Holy Spirit that she needs to forgive the person who committed </div><div class="t m659 x76 h11 y18f ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">this crime against her.

The person </div><div class="t m168 x46 hf y6b2 ff3 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">has committed a terrible crime. Does she plead for leniency? Does </div><div class="t m274 x46 hf y281 ff3 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">she ask that he be given the lightest sentence possible?

Yet, the crucial point to remember is that </div><div class="t m36f x46 h11 y4fc ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">we need to make a distinction between the civil and the spiritual, </div><div class="t m3d7 x46 h11 y266 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">between sin and crime, which are not always the same thing. </div><div class="t m2b5 x3e h11 y28f ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Maybe we are to forgive all things, but that doesn&apos;t necessarily </div><div class="t m84 x46 h11 y648 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">mean all things don&apos;t come with legal consequences.
