I&apos;ve been trying to call you for two months!&quot; </div><div class="t m236 x49 h15 y925 ff2 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Larisa Cholopova had first heard of Michael several months </div><div class="t m8f x65 h15 y97a ff2 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">before when she was examining records at a factory. One of the </div><div class="t m66e x65 h15 y927 ff2 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">workers there had told her that a former Komsomol leader had </div><div class="t m2cc x65 h15 y929 ff2 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">quit his job to become a Christian. The news had surprised Larisa. </div><div class="t m41 x65 h15 y92a ff2 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">She wondered what could have made the man quit a steady job to </div><div class="t m209 x65 h15 y97b ff2 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">become a Christian. The factory worker offered to introduce Larisa </div><div class="t m66f x65 h15 y92b ff2 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to the former Komsomol leader, so Larisa left her name and </div><div class="t mab x65 h15 y92c ff2 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">telephone number. </div><div class="t m427 x61 h15 y92d ff2 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">But before she could meet the man, Larisa became seriously ill </div><div class="t ma7 x65 h15 y97c ff2 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and was hospitalized. A friend visited her in the hospital and told </div><div class="t m670 x2a h15 y97d ff2 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">her about a study group she was attending. The study group </div><div class="t m343 x2a h15 y97e ff2 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sounded interesting, so when Larisa was strong enough, she went. </div><div class="t m671 x2a h15 y97f ff2 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">It was at this meeting that she met Michael. At first Larisa had </div><div class="t m421 x2a h15 y980 ff2 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">argued nearly every point the group discussed. But as she became </div><div class="t m3c7 x2a h15 y981 ff2 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">better acquainted with the members of the group, she found that </div><div class="t m4d2 x2a h15 y982 ff2 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Christianity made sense. </div><div class="t m49d x61 h15 y983 ff2 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Larisa&apos;s health problems persisted. When the doctors gave her </div><div class="t m259 x2a h15 y984 ff2 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">a grim prognosis, she accepted it as God&apos;s punishment for her past </div><div class="t m40 x2a h15 y985 ff2 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">deeds. But she asked her Christian friends to pray for her. </div><div class="t m48e x61 h15 y986 ff2 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Some members of the study group invited Larisa to evangelis-</div><div class="t m5b6 x2a h15 y987 ff2 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tic meetings being held in nearby Tashkent. She went with them </div><div class="t m4a2 x2a h15 y988 ff2 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and felt the Holy Spirit touch her heart. She responded to the call </div><div class="t m1b3 x2a h15 y989 ff2 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to follow Christ. Later when she returned to the doctor, her blood </div><div class="t m196 x31 h15 y98a ff2 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tests came back negative. God had not only healed her soul, but </div><div class="t me x31 h15 y98b ff2 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">her body as well. </div><div class="t m672 x61 h15 y98c ff2 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Larisa accepted God&apos;s call to study theology, and today she </div><div class="t m673 x31 h15 y98d ff2 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">serves as women&apos;s ministries director in a largely Muslim region </div><div class="t m24c x31 h15 y98e ff2 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of the former Soviet Union.
