But as they worked, they noticed </div><div class="t m209 x61 hf y1fc ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that some of the cabbage plants were beginning to wither. The </div><div class="t m20a x61 hf y1fd ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ground was dry, and there was no sign of rain. Without rain there </div><div class="t m58 x61 hf y1fe ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">would be no harvest, and the family would face a difficult year. </div><div class="t m20b x1f hf y1ff ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The Singhs had lost faith in the gods they had called upon </div><div class="t m20c x61 hf y200 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">throughout their lives, but they did not know where to turn for </div><div class="t m1b6 x61 hf y201 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">help.

He talked it over with his wife, </div><div class="t m210 x61 hf y204 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and they decided to pray to this unseen God for rain. &quot;If the God </div><div class="t m211 x61 hf y205 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of the Christians hears our prayer and answers, then we will know </div><div class="t m212 x7e hf y206 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that He is the true God,&quot; Mr. Singh told his wife.

The pastor baptized him that day, and </div><div class="t m218 x7e hf y210 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Mr. Singh went home happy. But he did not know what it meant to </div><div class="t m219 x7e hf y211 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">be a Christian. What should a follower of God be doing?
