But as they worked, they noticed </div><div class="t m209 x60 hd y1fb ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that some of the cabbage plants were beginning to wither. The </div><div class="t m20a x60 hd y1fc ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ground was dry, and there was no sign of rain. Without rain there </div><div class="t m58 x60 hd y1fd ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">would be no harvest, and the family would face a difficult year. </div><div class="t m20b x1e hd y1fe ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The Singhs had lost faith in the gods they had called upon </div><div class="t m20c x60 hd y1ff ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">throughout their lives, but they did not know where to turn for </div><div class="t m1b6 x60 hd y200 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">help. Which of Hinduism&apos;s 300,000 gods would answer their </div><div class="t m20d x60 hd y201 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">prayers for rain to make their cabbages grow? </div><div class="t m20e x1e hd y202 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Then Mr. Singh recalled hearing someone say that the God of </div><div class="t m20f x60 hd y46 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the Christians was all-powerful. He talked it over with his wife, </div><div class="t m210 x60 hd y203 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and they decided to pray to this unseen God for rain. &quot;If the God </div><div class="t m211 x60 hd y204 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of the Christians hears our prayer and answers, then we will know </div><div class="t m212 x7d hd y205 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that He is the true God,&quot; Mr. Singh told his wife. For the first time </div><div class="t m20a x7d hd y206 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in their lives the couple poured out their hearts to God for help. </div><div class="t m213 x1e hd y207 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">That night it rained.

Mr. Singh did not </div><div class="t m106 x7d hd y20a ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">hesitate; he set out to learn how he could become a follower of </div><div class="t m215 x7d hd y20b ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">this powerful God who had answered their prayer. But his wife </div><div class="t ma7 x7d hd y20c ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">hesitated. </div><div class="t m216 x1e hd y20d ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Mr. Singh found a Protestant pastor and asked him how he </div><div class="t m217 x7d hd y20e ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">could become a Christian. The pastor baptized him that day, and </div><div class="t m218 x7d hd y20f ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Mr. Singh went home happy. But he did not know what it meant to </div><div class="t m219 x7d hd y210 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">be a Christian. What should a follower of God be doing? How </div><div class="t m21a x7d hd y211 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">should he worship?
