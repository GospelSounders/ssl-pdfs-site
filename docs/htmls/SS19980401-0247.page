H. Zachary </div><div class="t m41e x60 he y3b1 ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Serafima worked in a fashionable store in Moscow. With Russia&apos;s </div><div class="t m6d x10 he y53e ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">new free market, her future looked bright. But one day an army </div><div class="t m258 x10 he y3b4 ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">officer came looking for her son. He was absent from his military </div><div class="t m488 x10 he y53f ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">post without leave, an extremely serious accusation. Suddenly Serafima&apos;s </div><div class="t m205 x10 he y540 ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">world began to crumble. Jewish by birth and the product of the </div><div class="t m489 x10 he y541 ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">godless Communist system, Serafima was not even sure that there </div><div class="t m434 x10 he y542 ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was a God. But she was desperate; she began to pray. </div><div class="t m48a x60 he y543 ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">God heard her prayers, she is sure, for not long after she prayed, </div><div class="t m48b x10 he y544 ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the government granted amnesty to soldiers who had left their posts. </div><div class="t m48c x28 he y545 ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Serafima&apos;s son could come home. Following this experience, Serafima </div><div class="t m48d x28 he y546 ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">believed that there was a God who cared for her and her son. But she </div><div class="t m48e x28 he y547 ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">did not know Him, nor did she know how to find Him. </div><div class="t m48f x60 he y548 ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">One day her son hurried home and told her, &quot;Mother, you must </div><div class="t m263 x28 he y549 ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">come to hear Mark Finley. He has really helped me to understand </div><div class="t m490 x28 he y54a ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">about God!&quot; Serafima went to Finley&apos;s meetings, and in time both </div><div class="t m29e x28 he y54b ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">she and her son were baptized. </div><div class="t m2a6 x1d he y54c ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">On the first Friday after her baptism, she went to her boss to ask </div><div class="t m282 x28 he y54d ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">for Sabbath off. Because of her strong record as a leader in sales, </div><div class="t m491 x28 he y54e ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">he granted her request. As winter approached, and the sun set </div><div class="t m492 x28 he y54f ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">earlier, Serafima asked for Fridays off. &quot;I am sorry,&quot; her boss said. </div><div class="t m493 x28 he y550 ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Your God will have to take care of that.&quot; Serafima knew she </div><div class="t m1ab x29 he y551 ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">would lose her job if she insisted on keeping the Sabbath. And jobs </div><div class="t m33c x29 he y552 ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">were precious. She wondered what God had in mind. </div><div class="t m431 x1d he y553 ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Serafima learned about the literature ministry. Was this where </div><div class="t m36b x29 he y554 ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">God was leading her? She was willing to try. Her friendly, outgoing </div><div class="t m34c x29 he y555 ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">manner and prior sales experience soon put her at the top in sales. But </div><div class="t m1c5 x29 he y556 ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">she was not interested in sales; she wanted to share with others the </div><div class="t m3d6 x29 he y557 ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">wonderful experience of coming to know God. Daily she prayed, </div><div class="t m494 x29 he y558 ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Help me find someone who will respond to you, Lord.&quot; </div><div class="t m495 x8d he y559 ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">God answered her prayer and sent her to </div><div class="t m496 x62 he y55a ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">a certain city to work. She knew no one </div><div class="t m497 x8a he y3d5 ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">there, but God had pointed the way. In </div><div class="t m342 x8a he y55b ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">faith, she packed her bags and bought a </div><div class="t m3af x8a he y55c ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">one-way ticket for the town God had told </div><div class="t m498 x8a he y3d8 ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">her to visit. </div><div class="t m376 xbc he y55d ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">(Continued next week) </div><div class="t m499 xbd h30 y55e ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Serafima Levinson (left).
