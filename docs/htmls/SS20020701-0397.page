When he discovered that his wife was a Christian, he sent her back </div><div class="t m732 x67 h10 yc8 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to her parents, but when she returned, Zachariah beat her. </div><div class="t m733 x2e h10 y595 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">After three days of fasting and prayer, she again tried to enter his </div><div class="t m6ee x67 h10 y596 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">home. This time he beat her, then he grabbed his knife to kill her. But </div><div class="t m25e x67 h10 y573 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">before he could strike the fatal blow, he saw a bright light above her. </div><div class="t m48f x2e h10 y598 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Suddenly he found himself lying on the floor, looking into the light. </div><div class="t m184 x67 h10 y599 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">He saw a person in the light, a person with a kind face. The Being </div><div class="t m493 x67 h10 y576 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">stood close to the fallen man and reached out as if to embrace </div><div class="t m6f1 x67 h10 y59a ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Zachariah. </div><div class="t m6a5 x2e h10 y577 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Zachariah cried out, &quot;Who are you?&quot; </div><div class="t m416 x7c h10 y578 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;I am the One you are fighting against,&quot; the Being answered. </div><div class="t m49c x2e h10 y579 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Zachariah began to weep. When he opened his eyes, the light was </div><div class="t m409 x67 h10 y7e5 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">gone. Only he and his wife were in the room. </div><div class="t m3e6 x2e h10 y59b ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Zachariah testifies that &quot;At that moment my whole life changed. </div><div class="t m734 x67 h10 y59c ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Anger drained from my body.&quot; The very next Sunday Zachariah was </div><div class="t m735 x77 h10 y57c ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in church.

He began to pray with her, and after several weeks, he was </div><div class="t m514 x77 h10 y737 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">baptized. </div><div class="t m37e x2e h10 y338 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Zachariah&apos;s family rejected him and tried to beat his wife.

Because he no longer could work in his family&apos;s </div><div class="t m307 x77 h10 y581 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">business, he became a full-time pastor. He has organized churches in </div><div class="t m403 x77 h10 y98c ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">three villages that now have 160 members. </div><div class="t m5c3 x43 h10 y98d ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Then early in 2000, he met an Adventist Christian who pointed him </div><div class="t m433 x77 h10 y584 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to the Bible Sabbath.
