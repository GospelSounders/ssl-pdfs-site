When he discovered that his wife was a Christian, he sent her back </div><div class="t m732 x68 h12 yc9 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to her parents, but when she returned, Zachariah beat her. </div><div class="t m733 x2f h12 y596 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">After three days of fasting and prayer, she again tried to enter his </div><div class="t m6ee x68 h12 y597 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">home. This time he beat her, then he grabbed his knife to kill her. But </div><div class="t m25e x68 h12 y574 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">before he could strike the fatal blow, he saw a bright light above her. </div><div class="t m48f x2f h12 y599 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Suddenly he found himself lying on the floor, looking into the light. </div><div class="t m184 x68 h12 y59a ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">He saw a person in the light, a person with a kind face. The Being </div><div class="t m493 x68 h12 y577 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">stood close to the fallen man and reached out as if to embrace </div><div class="t m6f1 x68 h12 y59b ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Zachariah. </div><div class="t m6a5 x2f h12 y578 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Zachariah cried out, &quot;Who are you?&quot; </div><div class="t m416 x7d h12 y579 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;I am the One you are fighting against,&quot; the Being answered. </div><div class="t m49c x2f h12 y57a ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Zachariah began to weep. When he opened his eyes, the light was </div><div class="t m409 x68 h12 y7e6 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">gone. Only he and his wife were in the room. </div><div class="t m3e6 x2f h12 y59c ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Zachariah testifies that &quot;At that moment my whole life changed. </div><div class="t m734 x68 h12 y59d ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Anger drained from my body.&quot; The very next Sunday Zachariah was </div><div class="t m735 x78 h12 y57d ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in church.

He began to pray with her, and after several weeks, he was </div><div class="t m514 x78 h12 y738 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">baptized. </div><div class="t m37e x2f h12 y339 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Zachariah&apos;s family rejected him and tried to beat his wife.

Because he no longer could work in his family&apos;s </div><div class="t m307 x78 h12 y582 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">business, he became a full-time pastor. He has organized churches in </div><div class="t m403 x78 h12 y98d ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">three villages that now have 160 members. </div><div class="t m5c3 x44 h12 y98e ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Then early in 2000, he met an Adventist Christian who pointed him </div><div class="t m433 x78 h12 y585 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to the Bible Sabbath.
