The young father was not well, and the family learned that he had </div><div class="t m669 x7a h11 y36f ff5 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">cancer. </div><div class="t m5cb x4c h11 y370 ff5 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">While buying bread in the market, Hatuna met two Georgian girls </div><div class="t m39c x7a h11 y371 ff5 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">who were studying at the seminary. As they talked the students learned </div><div class="t m371 x7a h11 y46d ff5 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">about the family&apos;s desperate needs. Gogi could not work, and the </div><div class="t m1c0 x54 h11 y373 ff5 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">family had no money. </div><div class="t m66a x4c h11 y374 ff5 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The students shared the family&apos;s situation with their Sabbath School </div><div class="t m66b x7a h11 y375 ff5 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">class, who began visiting Gogi in the hospital. </div><div class="t m66c x4c h11 y7de ff5 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Masha and her husband, Sasha, members of the class, love people </div><div class="t mc1 x7a h11 y376 ff5 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and quickly took this family under their wings. One day Masha </div><div class="t m66d x7a h11 y377 ff5 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">planned to visit the family, but the important errand slipped her mind </div><div class="t m66e x7a h11 y378 ff5 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">during her busy day. All day she knew she must do something impor-</div><div class="t m66f x54 h11 y379 ff5 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tant, but she could not remember what it was. Then late at night as she </div><div class="t m670 x54 h11 y5a6 ff5 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was preparing for bed, she remembered that she had not visited this </div><div class="t m12a x54 h11 y169 ff5 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">family. When she told her husband, he asked, &quot;Do you want to go </div><div class="t m671 x54 h11 y26d ff5 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">now?&quot; Masha quickly gathered some food and wrote a note. If the </div><div class="t m65c x54 h11 y168 ff5 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">family was already asleep, she would put the note and food on the </div><div class="t m672 x54 h11 y37b ff5 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">windowsill, where they could find it the next morning. </div><div class="t m673 x4c h11 y16c ff5 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">When Masha and Sasha arrived at the house, all the lights were on. </div><div class="t m254 x54 h11 y37c ff5 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Masha knew something was wrong. When they knocked, Hatuna </div><div class="t m674 x54 h11 y16e ff5 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">opened the door. Her face was wet with tears, and Masha could hear </div><div class="t m675 x54 h11 y37d ff5 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">loud cries. Gogi was in terrible pain. </div><div class="t m65c x91 h11 y170 ff5 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Masha and Sasha offered to pray for Gogi. As they ended their </div><div class="t m5b8 x54 h11 y171 ff5 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">prayer, Gogi&apos;s pain subsided. The couple stayed to read the Bible with </div><div class="t m676 x54 h11 y172 ff5 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">them and encourage them. When they left, Gogi&apos;s pain was gone. </div><div class="t m677 x4c h11 y173 ff5 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Gogi and Hatuna began attending Sabbath School, and in time they </div><div class="t m678 x54 h11 y478 ff5 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">were baptized. Gogi wanted to return to Georgia to die, but the family </div><div class="t m679 x54 h11 y175 ff5 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">had no money to travel. The Sabbath School members, none of whom </div><div class="t m5b3 x54 h11 y7df ff5 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">had more than bare essentials themselves, pooled their money and </div><div class="t m404 x54 h11 y177 ff5 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">bought them tickets to Georgia. Before they left, Gogi and Hatuna </div><div class="t m381 x54 h11 y178 ff5 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">promised to keep in touch. </div><div class="t m67a x91 h11 y179 ff5 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">When the couple arrived in Georgia, Gogi was weak, but felt no </div><div class="t m67b x1d h11 y17a ff5 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">pain.
