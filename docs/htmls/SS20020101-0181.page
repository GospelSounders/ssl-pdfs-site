As they talked the students learned </div><div class="t m371 x7b h13 y46e ff5 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">about the family&apos;s desperate needs. Gogi could not work, and the </div><div class="t m1c0 x55 h13 y374 ff5 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">family had no money. </div><div class="t m66a x4d h13 y375 ff5 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The students shared the family&apos;s situation with their Sabbath School </div><div class="t m66b x7b h13 y376 ff5 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">class, who began visiting Gogi in the hospital. </div><div class="t m66c x4d h13 y7df ff5 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Masha and her husband, Sasha, members of the class, love people </div><div class="t mc1 x7b h13 y377 ff5 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and quickly took this family under their wings. One day Masha </div><div class="t m66d x7b h13 y378 ff5 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">planned to visit the family, but the important errand slipped her mind </div><div class="t m66e x7b h13 y379 ff5 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">during her busy day. All day she knew she must do something impor-</div><div class="t m66f x55 h13 y37a ff5 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tant, but she could not remember what it was. Then late at night as she </div><div class="t m670 x55 h13 y5a7 ff5 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was preparing for bed, she remembered that she had not visited this </div><div class="t m12a x55 h13 y16a ff5 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">family. When she told her husband, he asked, &quot;Do you want to go </div><div class="t m671 x55 h13 y26e ff5 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">now?&quot; Masha quickly gathered some food and wrote a note. If the </div><div class="t m65c x55 h13 y169 ff5 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">family was already asleep, she would put the note and food on the </div><div class="t m672 x55 h13 y37c ff5 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">windowsill, where they could find it the next morning. </div><div class="t m673 x4d h13 y16d ff5 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">When Masha and Sasha arrived at the house, all the lights were on. </div><div class="t m254 x55 h13 y37d ff5 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Masha knew something was wrong. When they knocked, Hatuna </div><div class="t m674 x55 h13 y16f ff5 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">opened the door. Her face was wet with tears, and Masha could hear </div><div class="t m675 x55 h13 y37e ff5 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">loud cries. Gogi was in terrible pain. </div><div class="t m65c x92 h13 y171 ff5 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Masha and Sasha offered to pray for Gogi. As they ended their </div><div class="t m5b8 x55 h13 y172 ff5 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">prayer, Gogi&apos;s pain subsided. The couple stayed to read the Bible with </div><div class="t m676 x55 h13 y173 ff5 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">them and encourage them.

Gogi wanted to return to Georgia to die, but the family </div><div class="t m679 x55 h13 y176 ff5 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">had no money to travel. The Sabbath School members, none of whom </div><div class="t m5b3 x55 h13 y7e0 ff5 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">had more than bare essentials themselves, pooled their money and </div><div class="t m404 x55 h13 y178 ff5 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">bought them tickets to Georgia. Before they left, Gogi and Hatuna </div><div class="t m381 x55 h13 y179 ff5 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">promised to keep in touch. </div><div class="t m67a x92 h13 y17a ff5 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">When the couple arrived in Georgia, Gogi was weak, but felt no </div><div class="t m67b x1e h13 y17b ff5 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">pain.
