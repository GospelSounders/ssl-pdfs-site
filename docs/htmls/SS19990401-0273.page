For years she </div><div class="t m390 x35 h23 y658 ff4 fs19 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">cared for foster children. Most of the children came to her when they </div><div class="t m16d x35 h23 y562 ff4 fs19 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">were quite young, but one day a social worker told Ruth about a </div><div class="t m56c x35 h23 y659 ff4 fs19 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">teenage boy named Heinz who needed a home. He was having difficul-</div><div class="t m1ae x35 h23 y65a ff4 fs19 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ties in school and in the foster home where he had been staying. The </div><div class="t m659 x35 h23 y65b ff4 fs19 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">social worker asked Ruth to take him. </div><div class="t m632 x74 h23 y4c3 ff4 fs19 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Ruth was not sure. A teenager could be difficult to work with, and </div><div class="t m305 x35 h23 y65c ff4 fs19 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">she had other children in her home. Ruth told the social worker that she </div><div class="t m65a x3b h23 y65d ff4 fs19 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was an Adventist, and was away at church each Saturday from 8:00 to </div><div class="t m427 x3b h23 y65e ff4 fs19 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">2:00. German schools operated on Saturday mornings, and Ruth was </div><div class="t m65b x3b h23 y52c ff4 fs19 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sure the authorities would not want Heinz to miss classes. </div><div class="t m559 x74 h23 y4c8 ff4 fs19 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The social worker asked Ruth to think about it. A few days later the </div><div class="t m65c x3b h23 y65f ff4 fs19 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">social worker returned with permission for Ruth to take any child in her </div><div class="t m1e x3b h23 y660 ff4 fs19 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">care out of school on Saturdays to attend church with her. Ruth knew </div><div class="t m65d x3b h23 y661 ff4 fs19 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">God wanted her to take this boy. </div><div class="t m241 x74 h23 y662 ff4 fs19 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Heinz lived with Ruth for two years. He attended church with her, </div><div class="t m514 x3b h23 y663 ff4 fs19 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">but never really showed an interest in religion. When he was 15 he left </div><div class="t m65e x3b h23 y664 ff4 fs19 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">her home to attend a technical school to study carpentry. Writing was </div><div class="t m15 x3b h23 y665 ff4 fs19 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">difficult for him, and he seldom wrote to her, but he visited her once or </div><div class="t m65f x3b h23 y532 ff4 fs19 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">twice a year. She was always glad to see him, and prayed for him every </div><div class="t m660 x3b h23 y38d ff4 fs19 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">day. She knew he was a troubled, lonely boy. </div><div class="t m661 x20 h23 y666 ff4 fs19 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">One day Heinz came to visit Ruth and asked her where the Adventist </div><div class="t m508 x3b h23 y667 ff4 fs19 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">church in his city was. Surprised, Ruth gave him the address. </div><div class="t m1b x20 h23 y668 ff4 fs19 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Some time later a group of Pathfinders stayed with Ruth while they </div><div class="t m662 x3b h23 y669 ff4 fs19 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">toured the area. Heinz was visiting her at the time, and the Pathfinders </div><div class="t m2d8 x3b h23 y4d2 ff4 fs19 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">invited Ruth and Heinz to join them on Sabbath. The group&apos;s pastor </div><div class="t m663 x37 h23 y66a ff4 fs19 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">held a baptism that day and asked if anyone would like to prepare for </div><div class="t m9a x37 h23 y4d4 ff4 fs19 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">baptism. Heinz stood up! Ruth contacted a pastor from the area where </div><div class="t m2f x37 h23 y66b ff4 fs19 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Heinz lived and asked him to visit Heinz. He did, and Heinz was </div><div class="t m519 x54 h23 y4d6 ff4 fs19 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">eventually baptized. </div><div class="t m400 x2b h23 y4d7 ff4 fs19 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Ruth remembers that she almost did not </div><div class="t m664 x56 h23 y4b9 ff4 fs19 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">take this troubled teen into her home. But she </div><div class="t m665 x56 h23 y2a8 ff4 fs19 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">is so glad that God allowed her to care for him </div><div class="t m666 x56 h23 y66c ff4 fs19 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and pray for him and love him for God. </div><div class="t m667 x71 h33 y4da ff6 fs20 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Ruth Wetzel (left) lives in northern </div><div class="t m220 x56 h33 y58d ff6 fs20 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Germany.
