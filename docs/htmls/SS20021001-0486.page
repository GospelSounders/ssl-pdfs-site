We are impatient people, and, at times, we fail to see that </div><div class="t m132 x38 h20 y1ef ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">patience on our part is also required.

Yet, God </div><div class="t m4be x44 h20 y8c6 ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">cannot save people without their assent. The Israelites erred in their </div><div class="t m18b x44 h20 y340 ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">hearts (Heb. 3:10), and most did not enter their promised rest. Their </div><div class="t m140 x44 h20 y8af ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">participation in salvation depended upon their response.
