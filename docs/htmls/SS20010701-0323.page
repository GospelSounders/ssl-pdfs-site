She had always been sickly. &quot;What is your secret?&quot; </div><div class="t m30f x20 h13 y331 ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Jin&apos;s mother asked her friend. </div><div class="t me3 x60 h13 y332 ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;I have found Jesus Christ!&quot; the other woman said. Because of </div><div class="t m14 x20 h13 y333 ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">her friend&apos;s influence, Jin&apos;s mother decided to try attending church. </div><div class="t m8f x20 h13 y334 ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Maybe this Jesus could heal her health problems, too. </div><div class="t m9d x1c h13 y335 ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Jin did not go with his mother to church, but he listened as she </div><div class="t m293 x20 h13 y336 ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">told him what she was learning about Jesus. </div><div class="t m310 x32 h13 y337 ff7 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Perhaps I should seek </div><div class="t m1cd x20 h13 y338 ff7 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">after God for my own good, </div><div class="t mf x91 h13 y338 ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Jin thought. </div><div class="t m1d9 x1c h13 y339 ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Jin began to attend church with his mother.

Jin still had </div><div class="t m312 x20 h13 y33d ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">some questions about religion that no one had answered, so he </div><div class="t m297 x20 h13 y33e ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">accepted Zhu&apos;s invitation. </div><div class="t m313 x1c h13 y33f ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Jin was impressed with the way the house-church believers </div><div class="t m209 x20 h13 y340 ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">studied the Bible in detail.

When the group studied the Sabbath, Jin wondered why, if </div><div class="t m1e5 x20 h13 y342 ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the Sabbath is Saturday, Christians keep Sunday holy. More and </div><div class="t m184 x12 h13 y343 ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">more Jin was drawn to the little group of believers. </div><div class="t m132 x1c h13 y344 ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Jin and Zhu often talked about the differing beliefs of the two </div><div class="t m287 x12 h13 y345 ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">religious groups.

The </div><div class="t m2fe x12 h13 y347 ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">pastor of the Sunday church had offered to train Zhu for a leader-</div><div class="t m1bc x12 h13 y348 ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ship position, and his friend did not want to lose that privilege. </div><div class="t m315 x1c h13 y349 ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">One day as Jin and his friend were discussing religion, Zhu </div><div class="t m1d7 x12 h13 y34a ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">surprised him. &quot;You Adventists!&quot; he said. &quot;You have only a hand-</div><div class="t m316 x12 h13 y34b ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ful of believers.
