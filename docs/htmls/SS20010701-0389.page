We </div><div class="t m704 x53 h13 y938 ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">touched down on an airfield and were greeted by the local pastor. We </div><div class="t m558 x53 h13 y939 ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">unloaded food and supplies and were off again for another village. </div><div class="t m253 x60 h13 y872 ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Bob told me the village we would reach in 15 minutes by plane </div><div class="t m705 x53 h13 y873 ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">would take the pastor a week hiking through the jungle. </div><div class="t m399 x60 h13 y874 ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The Cessna flew low over the tiny jungle airstrip so Bob could </div><div class="t m706 x20 h13 y876 ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">inspect it before landing. Then he circled over the village to signal the </div><div class="t m601 x20 h13 y6c6 ff6 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">villagers that we had arrived.
