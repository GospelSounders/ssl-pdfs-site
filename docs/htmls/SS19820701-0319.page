On the </div><div class="t m1f9 x7b h19 y2d3 ff4 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">one hand there&apos;s the demand to come out of the world and to be </div><div class="t mc7 x7b h19 y2d4 ff4 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">separate from it. On the other hand we are plainly told that the </div><div class="t m2d6 x7b h19 y2d5 ff4 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">essence of being the church in the world is to become one with the </div><div class="t m2d7 x7b h19 y2d6 ff4 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">people of the world in taking an interest in their needs, interests, </div><div class="t m15d x7b h19 y2d7 ff4 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">work, and ambitions. Since both views are clearly biblical, we </div><div class="t m220 x7b h19 y2d8 ff4 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">now must give consideration to the question: How are these two </div><div class="t m22b x7b h19 y2d9 ff4 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">views related? And how can they both be implemented? Let there </div><div class="t m2d8 x7b h19 y2da ff4 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">be no misunderstanding about it: The church must be both </div><div class="t m2d9 x7b h19 y2db ff4 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">wholly different from the world—in its life-style, thought pat-</div><div class="t m2da x7b h19 y2dc ff4 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">terns, and conduct—and at the same time be part of the world and </div><div class="t m2db x7b h19 y2dd ff4 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">identify with its needs and activities. It cannot be denied that </div><div class="t m145 x7b h19 y2de ff4 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">there is an inherent tension here. But we must learn to live with </div><div class="t m2dc x7b h19 y2df ff4 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that tension and make it fruitful in our lives. </div><div class="t m2dd x2e h1a y2e0 ff3 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Describe the role of an ambassador for Christ.

In order to </div><div class="t m2e1 x47 h19 y2e3 ff4 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">do so we must be both a member of the household of Christ and a </div><div class="t m37 x7b h19 y2e4 ff4 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">child of this world in the same way that Christ Himself was both </div><div class="t m23f x47 h19 y2e5 ff4 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the Son of God and the Son of man.

We are called out of the </div><div class="t m2e3 x47 h19 y2e7 ff4 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">world and sent back in; we are gathered and dispersed. This </div><div class="t m160 x47 h19 y2e8 ff4 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">pendulum movement has at least three aspects. First, there is </div><div class="t m2e4 x47 h19 y2e9 ff4 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the weekly rhythm of coming out of the world where we live and </div><div class="t m145 x47 h19 y2ea ff4 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">work to worship and fellowship together on God&apos;s holy day. As </div><div class="t m1f5 x47 h19 y2eb ff4 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">we worship and fellowship together, we realize that we are not </div><div class="t m2e5 x47 h19 y2ec ff4 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">doing it for our own selves, but to the glory of God and for the </div><div class="t m2e6 x47 h19 y2ed ff4 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sake of the world. Each worship service, therefore, should be a </div><div class="t m2e7 x47 h19 y2ee ff4 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">preparation for our dispersion into the world, for whom the </div><div class="t m2e8 x47 h19 y2ef ff4 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">church exists. Second, there is our daily involvement in the </div><div class="t m2e9 x47 h19 y2f0 ff4 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">world&apos;s secular affairs and our coming out of the world to be with </div><div class="t m7f x47 h19 y2f1 ff4 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Christ in our daily devotions.
