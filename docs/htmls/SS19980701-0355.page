They soon found a house that </div><div class="t m1b3 x18 hd y562 ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">seemed to meet their needs. It had not been occupied for years, and </div><div class="t m109 x18 hd y563 ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the rent was surprisingly cheap. &quot;It belongs to a well-to-do family </div><div class="t m89 x18 hd y564 ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">who has moved closer to town,&quot; the agent explained.
