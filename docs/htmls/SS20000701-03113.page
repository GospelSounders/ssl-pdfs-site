He per-</div><div class="t m191 x5a h19 y4a6 ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">formed the ceremonies of his religion and refused to have any-</div><div class="t m515 x5a h19 y399 ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">thing to do with Christianity. Often he made unkind remarks to </div><div class="t m132 x5a h19 y39a ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Christians when they tried to speak to him of their faith. </div><div class="t m38a x6c h19 y638 ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Then Rao became ill with a mysterious affliction that paralyzed </div><div class="t m2ac x5a h19 ye ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">him from the waist down. Even specialists in a large hospital could </div><div class="t m59a x5a h19 y23e ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">not help the paralyzed man. His family took him to sacred Hindu </div><div class="t m538 x5a h19 y23f ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sites hoping that Rao would regain his health, but nothing hap-</div><div class="t m60c x5a h19 y39c ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">pened. Family members offered sacrifices of pigs, goats, and black </div><div class="t m2b8 x5a h19 y241 ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">chickens at another sacred temple, but still Rao felt no relief. </div><div class="t m6e5 x6c h19 y39d ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Unable to walk, Babu Rao had time to think about his future. A </div><div class="t m2b5 x5a h19 y242 ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Christian friend stopped by to encourage him and to tell Rao that </div><div class="t m2ad x71 h19 y39e ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">he and his family were praying for him. Touched, Rao asked him, </div><div class="t m506 x5a h19 y244 ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Can the Christian&apos;s God help me?&quot; </div><div class="t m768 x6c h19 y245 ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Jehovah God is able to do things that other gods and even </div><div class="t m3d6 x5a h19 y246 ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">doctors cannot do,&quot; his friend answered. Rao thanked his friend </div><div class="t m2b7 x71 h19 y386 ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and invited him to come back to visit and pray for him again. </div><div class="t m34d x6c h19 y247 ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The Christian friend told his congregation about Rao and urged </div><div class="t m6a4 x71 h19 y408 ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">them to pray for him. For two months the believers held special </div><div class="t m161 x71 h19 y4ae ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">services for Rao, during which the pastor and members fasted and </div><div class="t m2ec x71 h19 y4af ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">prayed for this Hindu man. </div><div class="t m69b x52 h19 y48 ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Rao began to regain feeling in his right leg. Soon he could place </div><div class="t m769 x71 h19 y387 ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">his weight on that leg. As feeling returned to his left leg, Babu Rao </div><div class="t m76a x71 h19 y388 ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">began to walk with the aid of crutches. As soon as possible, he </div><div class="t m74b x71 h19 y389 ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">attended services at the Adventist church. During a prayer meeting </div><div class="t m35f x71 h19 y2e2 ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Rao stood and told the members, &quot;I regret the way I spoke to you </div><div class="t m1b2 x15 h19 y38b ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in the past. Please forgive me. I have learned that Jesus is the true </div><div class="t m2b4 x71 h19 y2e4 ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">God.&quot; </div><div class="t m3cd x52 h19 y867 ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Babu Rao, the man who stubbornly opposed Christians, ac-</div><div class="t m6e9 x15 h19 y2e6 ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">cepted salvation through Christ and was baptized.
