The other was a narrow trail, rugged and dark. My people </div><div class="t m0 x6b h37 y475 ff12 fs3 fc3 sc0 ls2 ws81">were walking on the wide road, laughing and drinking as they traveled. On </div><div class="t m0 x6b h37 y476 ff12 fs3 fc3 sc0 ls2 ws21">the narrow path I saw you, and some children from the village, including </div><div class="t m0 x6b h37 y477 ff12 fs3 fc3 sc0 ls2 ws118">my own grandchildren. Thistles on the narrow path tore your skin, but you </div><div class="t m0 x6b h37 y478 ff12 fs3 fc3 sc0 ls2 ws60">didn’t seem to mind.
