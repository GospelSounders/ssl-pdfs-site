I was shaking as I told my father, “No, I </div><div class="t m0 x42 h1a y2f4 ffa9 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws54">don’t dance anymore.” Father urged me to dance, but I took a deep breath </div><div class="t m0 x42 h1a y2f5 ffa9 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 wsb7">and told him, “I have found a power that is stronger than witchcraft.” I </div><div class="t m0 x42 h1a y2f6 ffa9 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws42">knew that my words were a challenge to my father and the ghost dancers. </div><div class="t m0 x42 h1a y2f7 ffa9 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws1a">I prayed that my God would protect me from whatever evil would befall </div><div class="t m0 x42 h1a y2f8 ffa9 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">me. </div><div class="t m0 x7 h1a y2f9 ffa9 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 wsf2">When I didn’t show up for the ghost dancers’ practice session in the </div><div class="t m0 x42 h1a y2fa ffa9 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws132">bush, some dancers came to remind me it was time to dance. I told them </div><div class="t m0 x42 h1a y2fb ffa9 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws15">I wasn’t going to dance. They argued and tried to convince me to go with </div><div class="t m0 x42 h1a y2fc ffa9 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 wsa0">them, but I refused. Then these dancers grabbed me and forced me to go </div><div class="t m0 x42 h1a y2fd ffa9 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws1">with them. </div><div class="t m0 x7 h1a y2fe ffa9 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws64">We arrived at the place where the ghost dancers were preparing for the </div><div class="t m0 x42 h1a y2ff ffa9 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 wsa5">dance. I told them again that I wasn’t going to dance. Someone forced me </div><div class="t m0 x42 h1a y300 ffa9 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws132">to drink something, and I lost consciousness. They tried to wake me, but </div><div class="t m0 x42 h1a y301 ffa9 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 wsd6">I didn’t wake up until the next day, the day of the ceremony. The ghost </div><div class="t m0 x42 h1a y302 ffa9 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws4a">dancers tried to get me to dance, but I couldn’t even stand up. Finally my </div><div class="t m0 x42 h1a y303 ffa9 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws85">father came and told them to leave me alone. I slept through the entire </div><div class="t m0 x42 h1a y304 ffa9 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws1">ghost ceremony. </div><div class="t m0 x7 h1a y305 ffa9 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 wsad">After the ceremonies ended, my father took me aside and reminded me </div><div class="t m0 x42 h1a y306 ffa9 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws54">of vows I had taken to not tell anyone what we did in our dancing. Then a </div><div class="t m0 x42 h1a y307 ffa9 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws45">friend told me that I must leave the village or face death. I left my village </div><div class="t m0 x42 h1a y308 ffa9 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws1">and haven’t returned. </div><div class="t m0 x7 h1a y309 ffa9 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws58">I was 18 years old.
