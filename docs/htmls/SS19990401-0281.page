He </div><div class="t m157 x5e h25 y4c3 ff4 fs19 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">had struggled to get an education during the difficult years of war in </div><div class="t m679 x5e h25 y4c4 ff4 fs19 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">South Sudan. When he was in the third grade, the English-speaking </div><div class="t m2ed x5e h25 y4c5 ff4 fs19 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">school that he attended was forced to close because of the war. The </div><div class="t m6ab x5e h25 y4c6 ff4 fs19 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">school did not reopen, so when Samson was 18, he traveled to Juba, the </div><div class="t m663 x5e h25 y4c7 ff4 fs19 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">largest city in South Sudan, hoping to continue his education. But the </div><div class="t m305 x5e h25 y8 ff4 fs19 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">schools there also had been closed because of fighting. So Samson took </div><div class="t m5fd x5e h25 y4c8 ff4 fs19 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">work as a house boy while he waited to continue his education. </div><div class="t m3ed x49 h25 y6da ff4 fs19 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">When the schools in Juba finally reopened, Samson enrolled. But </div><div class="t m444 x5e h25 y661 ff4 fs19 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the Sudanese government now controlled the region, and classes were </div><div class="t m6ac x5e h25 y4cb ff4 fs19 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">taught in Arabic. Samson had to start over in school. Twelve years later </div><div class="t m6ad x5e h25 y663 ff4 fs19 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">he finally completed his studies and returned to his home area to teach </div><div class="t m458 x5e h25 y6db ff4 fs19 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and eventually become headmaster of a school. </div><div class="t m6ae x29 h25 y9c ff4 fs19 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">When in July 1996 some Adventist believers asked Samson permis-</div><div class="t m3a3 xd h25 y4cd ff4 fs19 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sion to use his school for evangelistic meetings, he agreed, not because </div><div class="t m1c0 xd h25 y4ce ff4 fs19 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">he believed what they taught, but because he was confident that he </div><div class="t m444 xd h25 y4cf ff4 fs19 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">could teach these Adventists a thing or two about religion. </div><div class="t m6af x29 h25 y4d0 ff4 fs19 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Before the opening meeting, Samson got drunk on the local brew to </div><div class="t m2da xd h25 y4d1 ff4 fs19 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">bolster his courage. He arrived at the meeting, and the ushers offered </div><div class="t m631 xd h25 ya1 ff4 fs19 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">him a seat on the front row and a Bible to use. When the preacher </div><div class="t m6b0 xd h25 y4d2 ff4 fs19 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">began talking about Jesus&apos; second coming, Samson sat spellbound.
