The young people from my church helped me contact </div><div class="t m62f x27 h20 y65e ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the people and invite them to the meetings. </div><div class="t m697 x28 h20 y87d ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Not far from the meeting place stood the home of a single </div><div class="t m698 x27 h20 y87e ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">mother named Gigi. She supports her seven children by working in </div><div class="t md7 x27 h20 y87f ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the nearby fields, carrying heavy bunches of bananas and loads of </div><div class="t m3ed x27 h20 y880 ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">pineapple to market. This was back-breaking work for Gigi, but </div><div class="t m199 x27 h20 y640 ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">she could not let her children go hungry. </div><div class="t m699 x22 h20 y7 ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">For several days Gigi and her children had been kept awake at </div><div class="t m45c x27 h20 y6ef ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">night by strange noises. From midnight until sunrise it sounded as </div><div class="t m1cd x27 h20 y54b ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">if someone were throwing rocks onto her tin roof. In the morning </div><div class="t mb5 x27 h20 y294 ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the family was too tired to go to work or school. </div><div class="t m295 x22 h20 y17f ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Desperate for some rest, Gigi consulted a local medium. The </div><div class="t m222 x27 h20 y180 ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">man told her that her former husband had cast a spell on her home. </div><div class="t mfb x27 h20 y54c ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The man gave Gigi some bottles filled with liquid and told her to </div><div class="t m51 x27 h20 y182 ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sprinkle the liquid in and around her house. He also told her to </div><div class="t m458 x27 h20 y183 ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">write the names Melkior, Gaspar, and Balthazar above each door </div><div class="t mb1 x74 h20 y184 ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and window. </div><div class="t m3fd x22 h20 y6fa ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Gigi did as the medium had instructed her, but the night was as </div><div class="t m182 x74 h20 y186 ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">noisy as ever. She returned to the medium and complained that his </div><div class="t mb6 x27 h20 y881 ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;cure&quot; had not worked. Several times she visited him, hoping that </div><div class="t m65c x74 h20 y187 ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">he could cast out the demons who were making her life unbearable, </div><div class="t m64a x74 h20 y3fe ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">but nothing helped. In the end, Gigi had spent every cent she had </div><div class="t m10c x74 h20 y3ff ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">for nothing. </div><div class="t m500 x24 h20 y400 ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">About this time Gigi received an invitation to the evangelistic </div><div class="t m374 x74 h20 y18a ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">meetings. She and her children attended the meetings, hoping to </div><div class="t m8c x74 h20 y3d1 ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">find a measure of peace from the demonic noises in the night. The </div><div class="t m32b x9 h20 y3d2 ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">family listened to the messages. Soon they began to believe. Gigi </div><div class="t m3f7 x74 h20 y29f ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">had come to find physical rest and peace, but she found rest in </div><div class="t me0 x74 h20 y85f ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Jesus and peace of heart. She learned to worship and pray and trust </div><div class="t m554 x9 h20 y860 ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in the power of Jesus Christ over the spirits. </div><div class="t m5d4 x24 h20 y861 ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Following the meetings Gigi and five of her children were </div><div class="t m2ab x9 h20 y12c ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">baptized. Today Gigi serves as a deaconess in the church. One of </div><div class="t m2e6 x9 h20 y863 ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">her daughters teaches Sabbath School, and another sings in choir </div><div class="t m629 x9 h20 y882 ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and leads children&apos;s Sabbath School.
