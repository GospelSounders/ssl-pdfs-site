Jer. 31:3. </div><div class="t m26 x66 h18 y368 ff7 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">True love does not forget. It always seeks to help, never to hurt. </div><div class="t m5a5 x42 h18 y127 ff7 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">One of the best ways in which love can show itself is by giving </div><div class="t m51d x42 h18 y369 ff7 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">counsel. Gifts of counsel are often of greater value than any other </div><div class="t m299 x42 h18 y86 ff7 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">gifts. They cannot be measured in terms of material value, although at </div><div class="t m21c x42 h18 y278 ff7 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">times they are of the highest material value. Heavenly counsel pro-</div><div class="t m3d5 x42 h18 y129 ff7 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">vides us with the greatest values we can obtain in life. </div><div class="t m5a6 x2c h18 y36a ff7 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Counsel from people is not always prompted by love and is not </div><div class="t m474 x42 h18 y27a ff7 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">always wise. People may give counsel to others that they would not </div><div class="t m554 x42 h18 y27b ff7 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">want for themselves.

Accepted, God&apos;s counsel may seem to hurt at the </div><div class="t m249 x42 h18 y40 ff7 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">time, but its fruitage is always good. </div><div class="t m2b x2c h18 y61 ff7 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Those whom God loves, He rebukes and disciplines (Rev. 3:19). </div><div class="t m439 x42 h18 y36d ff7 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Jesus at times administered counsel in terms of stern rebuke. But when </div><div class="t m3d7 x42 h18 y4e ff7 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">He did, it was prompted by love. &quot;He did not censure human weak-</div><div class="t m38c x42 h18 y36e ff7 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ness. He spoke the truth, but always in love. He denounced hypocrisy, </div><div class="t m3d7 x42 h18 y36f ff7 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">unbelief, and iniquity; but tears were in His voice as He uttered His </div><div class="t m32d x42 h18 y370 ff7 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">scathing rebukes.&quot;—Steps </div><div class="t m3e0 x44 h18 y370 ff9 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to Christ, </div><div class="t m370 x12 h18 y370 ff7 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">p. 12. </div><div class="t m5a9 x2c h18 y371 ff7 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">As persons and situations differ, so counsel varies. What is good </div><div class="t m55c x42 h18 y6f0 ff7 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">counsel for one may prove to be poor counsel for others.
