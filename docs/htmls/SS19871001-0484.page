If it was illegal, the guards would have </div><div class="t m6b x4 h1f ya2a ff4 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">executed summarily any would-be entrant. Instead, it is suggested that peo-</div><div class="t m244 x4 h1f y74f ff4 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ple could approach the king when he sat on his throne. But in doing so, they </div><div class="t m4fb x4 h1f y167 ff4 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">were staking everything on winning the king&apos;s favor. </div><div class="t m2ff x24 h1f y880 ff4 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">One description of how this worked pictures a throne room with guards </div><div class="t m160 x4 h1f ya2b ff4 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">lining each side and the king sitting at the end opposite the door. If an unbid-</div><div class="t m9a x4 h1f y2ec ff4 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">den party entered the room, the guards fell in behind the person, with spears </div><div class="t m352 x4 h1f ya2c ff4 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">lowered. The danger of assassination was ever present for the king. He and </div><div class="t m321 x4 h1f ya2d ff4 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">his guards always had to be alert. If some indication of his favor had not </div><div class="t m63c x4 h1f ya2e ff4 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">been given by the time the unbidden caller neared the throne, the guards </div><div class="t m557 x4 h1f y370 ff4 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">would execute the intruder. </div><div class="t m63d x20 h1e ya2f ff1 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">THINK IT THROUGH: Read Esther 5:3, 4. Was there any particular </div><div class="t m4a9 x20 h1e ya30 ff1 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">wisdom in Esther&apos;s not pleading her case right then and there? If she </div><div class="t m523 x4 h1e ya31 ff1 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was trying to ensure that the king would be in an environment condu-</div><div class="t m188 x20 h1e ya32 ff1 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">cive to the granting of her request, would that be a lack of faith?

Esther&apos;s banquet was ready a short time after her confrontation with </div><div class="t m85 x20 h1f ya37 ff4 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the king. She planned carefully how she would be most likely to accomplish </div><div class="t m417 x20 h1f ya38 ff4 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">her ends.
