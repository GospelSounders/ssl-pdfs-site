If it was illegal, the guards would have </div><div class="t m6b x3 h1c ya29 ff4 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">executed summarily any would-be entrant. Instead, it is suggested that peo-</div><div class="t m244 x3 h1c y74e ff4 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ple could approach the king when he sat on his throne. But in doing so, they </div><div class="t m4fb x3 h1c y166 ff4 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">were staking everything on winning the king&apos;s favor. </div><div class="t m2ff x23 h1c y87f ff4 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">One description of how this worked pictures a throne room with guards </div><div class="t m160 x3 h1c ya2a ff4 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">lining each side and the king sitting at the end opposite the door. If an unbid-</div><div class="t m9a x3 h1c y2eb ff4 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">den party entered the room, the guards fell in behind the person, with spears </div><div class="t m352 x3 h1c ya2b ff4 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">lowered. The danger of assassination was ever present for the king. He and </div><div class="t m321 x3 h1c ya2c ff4 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">his guards always had to be alert. If some indication of his favor had not </div><div class="t m63c x3 h1c ya2d ff4 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">been given by the time the unbidden caller neared the throne, the guards </div><div class="t m557 x3 h1c y36f ff4 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">would execute the intruder. </div><div class="t m63d x1f h1b ya2e ff1 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">THINK IT THROUGH: Read Esther 5:3, 4. Was there any particular </div><div class="t m4a9 x1f h1b ya2f ff1 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">wisdom in Esther&apos;s not pleading her case right then and there? If she </div><div class="t m523 x3 h1b ya30 ff1 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was trying to ensure that the king would be in an environment condu-</div><div class="t m188 x1f h1b ya31 ff1 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">cive to the granting of her request, would that be a lack of faith?

Esther&apos;s banquet was ready a short time after her confrontation with </div><div class="t m85 x1f h1c ya36 ff4 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the king. She planned carefully how she would be most likely to accomplish </div><div class="t m417 x1f h1c ya37 ff4 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">her ends. God expects those who perform His will to plan their actions care-</div><div class="t m641 x1f h1c y603 ff4 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">fully and well. </div><div class="t m563 x1f h1b ya38 ff1 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ILLUMINATION: </div><div class="t m52b x26 h1c ya38 ff4 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;The crisis that Esther faced demanded quick, earnest </div><div class="t m642 x1f h1c ya39 ff4 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">action; but both she and Mordecai realized that unless God should work </div><div class="t m489 x1f h1c ya3a ff4 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">mightily in their behalf, their own efforts would be unavailing. So Esther </div><div class="t m49e x1f h1c ya3b ff4 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">took time for communion with God, the source of her strength.&quot;—Prophets </div><div class="t m97 x1f h1c ya3c ff5 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and Kings, </div><div class="t mda xc4 h1c ya3c ff4 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">p. 601. </div><div class="t m15c x2a h1b ya3d ff1 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">When the meal was completed, what question did Ahasuerus ask Es-</div><div class="t m643 x1f h1b ya3e ff1 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ther?
