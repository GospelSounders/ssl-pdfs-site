Suddenly they were surrounded by warriors with spears raised, </div><div class="t m453 x52 ha y5c3 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ready to strike. One of the students quickly explained who they were, </div><div class="t m4d5 x52 ha y5c4 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and eventually the warriors allowed the students to go. </div><div class="t m278 x75 ha y5c5 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Later, when a team of students and medical personnel visited </div><div class="t m4d6 x52 ha y5c6 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Lapangon, they missed the shortcut trail to the village.
