In a few minutes the plane circled the tiny </div><div class="t m531 x78 ha y651 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">jungle landing strip to announce its approach. By the time it landed, </div><div class="t mf2 x78 ha y652 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the entire village had gathered to greet the visitors. </div><div class="t m327 x1d ha y653 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">But Pastor Davai did not recognize anyone in the crowd. &quot;Can </div><div class="t m1ae x78 ha y654 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">you tell me if there are Seventh-day Adventists here?&quot; he asked. </div><div class="t m18b x1d ha y655 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;What are Seventh-day Adventists?&quot; one man replied. During </div><div class="t m4a3 x19 ha y656 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the conversation that followed, Pastor Davai and the pilot learned </div><div class="t m50d x19 ha y657 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that they had landed at the village of Tawa instead of their in-</div><div class="t m532 x19 ha y658 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tended destination. Before they climbed back into the plane, Pastor </div><div class="t m533 x19 ha y659 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Davai asked, &quot;May we return sometime to visit you?&quot; </div><div class="t m534 x1d ha y65a ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Yes, you are welcome to return,&quot; the villagers answered. </div><div class="t m37 x1d ha y65b ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Several months later a man entered the mission office and asked </div><div class="t m535 x19 ha y65c ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">if he could speak to &quot;the big fella.&quot; He was shown into Pastor </div><div class="t m164 x19 ha y65d ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Davai&apos;s office. As they talked, Pastor Davai realized that the man </div><div class="t m33e x19 ha y65e ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">had come from the village of Tawa. </div><div class="t mfb x1d ha y65f ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;How did you know where to find us?&quot; Pastor Davai asked. The </div><div class="t m536 x19 ha y21 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">man told the pastor that he had remembered the three angels </div><div class="t m1ed x19 ha y13c ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">emblem on the mission plane. He walked through the streets of the </div><div class="t m1b5 x19 ha y660 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">city until he found a sign with the same logo. The sign was on the </div><div class="t m64 x19 ha y661 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">mission office. </div><div class="t m19c x1d ha y662 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;When can you come to Tawa village?&quot; the man asked. &quot;We </div><div class="t m38c x19 ha y663 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">have been waiting for you.&quot; Pastor Davai recognized God&apos;s call, </div><div class="t m4e x19 ha y664 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">but he explained to his visitor that the village is quite distant from </div><div class="t m537 x19 ha y665 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the mission headquarters and that there is no access by land. </div><div class="t m538 x4f ha y666 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">However, he promised to send someone as soon as he could. </div><div class="t m49b x66 ha y144 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Pastor Davai asked Casenov, a lay missionary, to go to Tawa to </div><div class="t m1a3 x19 ha y9e ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">survey the people&apos;s interests and needs and to help them. </div><div class="t m539 x66 ha yf4 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The people of Tawa welcomed the lay missionary. They built a </div><div class="t m4f x4f ha y667 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">simple church and house for their pastor. Casenov remained in the </div><div class="t m4e x4f ha y668 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">village seeking interests, studying daily with those who wanted to </div><div class="t m41c x4f ha y669 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">learn about God, and teaching simple health remedies to these </div><div class="t m489 x4f ha y66a ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">isolated villagers. Today the little church has 16 baptized members </div><div class="t m3bf x4f ha y66b ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and 40 more preparing for baptism.
