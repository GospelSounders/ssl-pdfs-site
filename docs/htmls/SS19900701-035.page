For </div><div class="t mda x5b h11 ya1 ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">one thing, the psalms are poetry, and the language of poetry has widespread appeal. </div><div class="t mdb x5b h11 ya2 ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">For another thing, the psalms reflect the wisdom, praise, and prayers of men of God, </div><div class="t mdc x5b h11 ya3 ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">chief among them being King David. Our personal expressions of sorrow, suffer-</div><div class="t m8f x5b h11 ya4 ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ing, despair, confidence, victory, and praise are a distant echo of those so eloquent-</div><div class="t mdd x5b h11 ya5 ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ly expressed by the psalmist. What he says is important to us who would like to fol-</div><div class="t mde x5b h11 ya6 ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">low in his footsteps of dedication and service. </div><div class="t mdf x42 h11 ya7 ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Because there are so many psalms, our Bible book curriculum assigns two </div><div class="t me0 x5b h11 ya8 ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">quarters to study a representative selection. This quarter, after an introductory les-</div><div class="t m90 x5b h11 ya9 ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">son, we will study one psalm each week, focusing on the major topic dealt with in </div><div class="t me1 x5b h11 yaa ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that psalm. The psalms that have been selected from the first half of the book will </div><div class="t me2 x5b h11 yab ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">be studied from the standpoint of practical application to our lives. The important </div><div class="t me3 x5b h11 yac ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">question considered each week will be, What is the psalmist saying, and how does </div><div class="t me4 x5b h11 yad ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">his experience apply to us? </div><div class="t me5 x42 h11 yae ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">On what basis have we chosen the psalms for individual study? In some cases, </div><div class="t me6 x41 h11 yaf ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">we have bowed to popular appeal, as in the case of the Shepherd&apos;s Psalm. In other </div><div class="t me7 x5b h11 yb0 ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">cases, we have been influenced by the recommendation of Ellen G.

In all cases, we </div><div class="t me9 x41 h11 yb2 ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">have felt that the psalmist has something important to say to us, something we ought </div><div class="t mea x41 h11 yb3 ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to note, and something to sing about! </div><div class="t meb x43 h11 yb4 ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Eight names of persons occurring in the superscriptions to the psalms appear </div><div class="t mec x41 h11 yb5 ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to be the names of authors, contributors, compilers, musicians, or others associated </div><div class="t med x41 h11 yb6 ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">with the composition, compilation, and use of the sacred lyrics.
