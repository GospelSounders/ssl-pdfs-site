Colossians, which was no doubt written about </div><div class="t m195 x1b hb y19e ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the same time as Ephesians, lists eleven individuals, including Tychicus, </div><div class="t m196 x1b hb y19f ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in its final chapter. In writing his concluding chapter to the Romans, Paul </div><div class="t m197 x1b hb y1a0 ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">mentions 35 personal names. These include some who were sending their </div><div class="t m198 x1b hb y1a1 ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">greetings to the Romans. </div><div class="t m199 x58 hb y1a2 ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The lack of personal references in Ephesians could suggest that Paul </div><div class="t m19a x1b hb y1a3 ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">may have not known many of the Ephesian members by name at the time </div><div class="t m19b x1b hb y1a4 ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">he wrote. However, this would be strange in view of the fact that he had </div><div class="t me2 x1b hb y1a5 ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">labored nearly three years and three months in Ephesus. (See Acts 19:1, </div><div class="t m186 x1b hb y1a6 ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">8, 10.) A better explanation is that the letter was intended for the believ-</div><div class="t m19c x1b hb y1a7 ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ers in the towns and villages surrounding Ephesus as well. If the letter </div><div class="t m19d x1b hb y1a8 ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">were addressed to other believers besides those at Ephesus, then we </div><div class="t m19e x1b hb y1a9 ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">would not expect Paul to name persons in just the one church. Doing so </div><div class="t m10 x1b hb y1aa ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">would cause the others to feel left out. Thus the opening words of Paul in </div><div class="t m19f x1b hb y1ab ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">this epistle can be better understood to read: &quot;Paul, an apostle of Jesus </div><div class="t m4a x1b hb y1ac ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Christ by the will of God, to the saints which are in the Ephesian region.&quot; </div><div class="t m1a0 x1b hb y1ad ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The letter to the Colossians was written not only for the church at </div><div class="t m1a1 x1b hb y1ae ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Colossae but also for the churches at nearby Laodicea and Hierapolis </div><div class="t m1a2 x1c hb y1af ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">(Col. 4:13-16). In the same way, Ephesians could have been written for the </div><div class="t m1a3 x1c hb y1b0 ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">churches in the neighborhood of Ephesus. </div><div class="t m3e x1c hc y1b1 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">III.
