Nations and </div><div class="t m284 x66 h23 y689 ff4 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">people may vary as to the names of the months, or the number of the years, </div><div class="t m346 x66 h23 y68a ff4 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">or when the years begin and end; but all can count from one to seven, and </div><div class="t m430 x66 h23 y68b ff4 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">all may know when the Sabbath, the seventh day of the week, comes </div><div class="t m431 x66 h23 y68c ff4 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">around. It is important to know that the weekly cycle has never been </div><div class="t m33b x66 h23 y68d ff4 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">changed. Efforts to do so in Russia and in France after their political </div><div class="t m17f x66 h23 y68e ff4 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">upheavals in this century and the eighteenth century respectively, have ut-</div><div class="t m3c3 x66 h23 y68f ff4 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">terly failed. We can be sure that the seventh day in the twentieth century is </div><div class="t m140 x66 h23 y690 ff4 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the same seventh day that Jesus observed as the Sabbath. </div><div class="t m19d x66 h24 y691 ff1 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">7. </div><div class="t m147 x69 h24 y692 ff1 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">What interesting personification is made of the sun? Ps. 19:5, 6. </div><div class="t m298 x69 h23 y693 ff4 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The sun is a dependable timepiece in the heavens. From our standpoint </div><div class="t m432 x66 h23 y694 ff4 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">it moves obediently, regularly, strongly, and effectively.

The fact is that in spite of modem </div><div class="t m140 x66 h23 y699 ff4 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">astronomy, in spite of all the diagrams we have seen about the orbit of the </div><div class="t mc8 x66 h23 y69a ff4 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">earth around the sun, we still talk about the sun setting in the west and ris-</div><div class="t m319 x66 h23 y69b ff4 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ing in the east! If we do this in the twentieth century with all our learning </div><div class="t m422 x66 h23 y69c ff4 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and advancement in science, we can surely let the psalmist draw his pic-</div><div class="t m9c x66 h23 y69d ff4 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ture, and understand what he means. He is telling us that God is the God of </div><div class="t mf7 x66 h23 y69e ff4 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">order, and He is in control. We can still use our sundials, and know the </div><div class="t meb x66 h23 y69f ff4 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">time of day. We can still navigate by the stars and know the direction we </div><div class="t mc1 x66 h23 y6a0 ff4 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">are taking. God&apos;s order is not only fixed; it is unshakable, unchangeable, </div><div class="t m17d x66 h23 y6a1 ff4 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">until God Himself decides to make some changes. </div><div class="t m158 x66 h24 y6a2 ff1 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">III.
