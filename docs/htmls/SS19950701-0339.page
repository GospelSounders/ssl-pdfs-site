A devout Catholic, Gloria rose </div><div class="t m157 x7 h14 y508 ff1 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">early every morning to spend time with the Lord before begin-</div><div class="t m3e9 x92 h14 y509 ff1 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ning her daily tasks. </div><div class="t m23 x1 h14 y9f ff1 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Rosa Ramos, Gloria&apos;s neighbor, noticed her devotion and spoke </div><div class="t m200 x92 h14 y50a ff1 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to her about the second coming of Jesus. Gloria was impressed </div><div class="t m21b x92 h14 y50b ff1 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and wanted to know more, so Rosa enrolled her in Bible studies. </div><div class="t m5b x92 h14 y50c ff1 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Gloria then began to share what she learned with others, begin-</div><div class="t m318 x92 h14 y50d ff1 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ning with her two children and some friends. Eventually several </div><div class="t m273 x92 h14 y50e ff1 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">people joined the family of the Lord and became links in the </div><div class="t m1ca x92 h14 ya1 ff1 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">chain that never ends. </div><div class="t m3ea x1 h14 y50f ff1 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Gloria moved to another part of Madrid and there continued to </div><div class="t m3eb x92 h14 y510 ff1 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">share her faith with others. Mary Lazaro listened to what Gloria </div><div class="t m76 x92 h14 y511 ff1 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">had to say. Mary&apos;s husband had left her and their four children for </div><div class="t ma9 x92 h14 y512 ff1 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">another woman. Through Mary&apos;s difficulties, Gloria encouraged </div><div class="t m3ec xc h14 y513 ff1 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">her and told her about Christ. </div><div class="t m3ed x1 h14 y514 ff1 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Gloria invited me to study the Bible with Mary and her. Each </div><div class="t m3ee xc h14 y515 ff1 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">week before we began our Bible study we shared the victories </div><div class="t m3ef xc h14 y516 ff1 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and answered prayers in Mary&apos;s life. Her oldest son suffered </div><div class="t m1f3 xc h14 y517 ff1 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">from asthma, and now he is well. Her youngest son&apos;s nervous </div><div class="t m3f0 xc h14 y518 ff1 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">disorder has improved. And her second son, who had gone with </div><div class="t m16e xc h14 y519 ff1 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">his father, is now with her, and they were renewing their mother-</div><div class="t m3f1 xc h14 y51a ff1 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">son relationship. There was another problem: Mary smoked and </div><div class="t m3f2 xc h14 y51b ff1 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">confessed that she could not leave it, although she knew she </div><div class="t m3f3 xc h14 y51c ff1 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">needed to. One night after our Bible Study we prayed especially </div><div class="t m214 xc h14 y51d ff1 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that the Lord would give Mary the strength to quit smoking. The </div><div class="t m3f4 xc h14 y51e ff1 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">next week when we met, Mary told me that after my prayer she </div><div class="t m31b xc h14 y51f ff1 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">felt God&apos;s strength and had quit smoking. </div><div class="t m19d x6 h14 y520 ff1 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">We continued our Bible studies, and in time Mary and three of </div><div class="t m1c9 xc h14 y521 ff1 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">her children were baptized.
