Gloria was impressed </div><div class="t m21b x93 h18 y50c ff1 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and wanted to know more, so Rosa enrolled her in Bible studies. </div><div class="t m5b x93 h18 y50d ff1 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Gloria then began to share what she learned with others, begin-</div><div class="t m318 x93 h18 y50e ff1 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ning with her two children and some friends. Eventually several </div><div class="t m273 x93 h18 y50f ff1 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">people joined the family of the Lord and became links in the </div><div class="t m1ca x93 h18 ya2 ff1 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">chain that never ends. </div><div class="t m3ea x2 h18 y510 ff1 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Gloria moved to another part of Madrid and there continued to </div><div class="t m3eb x93 h18 y511 ff1 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">share her faith with others. Mary Lazaro listened to what Gloria </div><div class="t m76 x93 h18 y512 ff1 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">had to say. Mary&apos;s husband had left her and their four children for </div><div class="t ma9 x93 h18 y513 ff1 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">another woman. Through Mary&apos;s difficulties, Gloria encouraged </div><div class="t m3ec xd h18 y514 ff1 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">her and told her about Christ. </div><div class="t m3ed x2 h18 y515 ff1 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Gloria invited me to study the Bible with Mary and her.

Her youngest son&apos;s nervous </div><div class="t m3f0 xd h18 y519 ff1 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">disorder has improved.

There was another problem: Mary smoked and </div><div class="t m3f2 xd h18 y51c ff1 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">confessed that she could not leave it, although she knew she </div><div class="t m3f3 xd h18 y51d ff1 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">needed to. One night after our Bible Study we prayed especially </div><div class="t m214 xd h18 y51e ff1 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that the Lord would give Mary the strength to quit smoking. The </div><div class="t m3f4 xd h18 y51f ff1 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">next week when we met, Mary told me that after my prayer she </div><div class="t m31b xd h18 y520 ff1 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">felt God&apos;s strength and had quit smoking. </div><div class="t m19d x7 h18 y521 ff1 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">We continued our Bible studies, and in time Mary and three of </div><div class="t m1c9 xd h18 y522 ff1 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">her children were baptized.
