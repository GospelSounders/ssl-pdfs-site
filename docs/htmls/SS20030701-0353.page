All that sin causes us to do to ourselves and to </div><div class="t m282 x76 he y1d6 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">one another is because of what sin has done to us and to our relation-</div><div class="t m495 x76 he y3b6 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ship with God. Sin ruptured that relationship, caused an estrangement, </div><div class="t m3d x76 he y439 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and created a division between the Creator and the created so that the </div><div class="t me0 x76 he y3b8 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">created became separated from the only Source of his or her existence, </div><div class="t mcc x76 he y43a ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">life, and purpose. This separation comes with consequences more dire </div><div class="t mae x76 he y43b ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">than if the umbilical cord were severed in the womb, because what the </div><div class="t m2b4 x76 he y3bb ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">created lost because of sin wasn&apos;t just physical, but spiritual, even </div><div class="t m496 x76 he y43c ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">eternal. </div><div class="t m47b x1b he y206 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">First and foremost, then, it was to heal this infinite and eternal rift </div><div class="t m497 x76 he y1de ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that Jesus Christ came, died, and now ministers in heaven in our </div><div class="t m1a5 xf he y455 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">behalf. </div><div class="t m1e5 x1b he y43d ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">And this is what Hebrews is about: God healing the rift between </div><div class="t m498 xf he y457 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">heaven and earth.

A key theme in Hebrews is purification.
