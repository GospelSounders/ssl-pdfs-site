He believed in the gods of </div><div class="t m3dd x47 h1a y580 ff4 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the mountains, the rocks, the trees, the sun, the harvest; but he </div><div class="t m427 x47 h1a y581 ff4 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">did not believe in the God of the universe. He would laugh at </div><div class="t m428 x47 h1a y56 ff4 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">his three wives when he caught them praying, and often tried </div><div class="t m429 x4a h1a y582 ff4 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to pry their eyes open in an attempt to stop their prayers. </div><div class="t m42a x8 h1a y583 ff4 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">One night Datu Mangol had a dream. He saw a narrow path </div><div class="t m42b x4a h1a y584 ff4 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">with boiling water on one side and fire on the other. He heard a </div><div class="t m31f x4a h1a y585 ff4 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">voice instructing him to walk on the narrow path. Frightened, he </div><div class="t m42c x4a h1a y586 ff4 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">hesitated, but the voice urged him to walk in faith, for the God of </div><div class="t m42d x4a h1a y587 ff4 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the universe would keep him from falling. Still frightened, Datu </div><div class="t m42d x4a h1a y588 ff4 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Mangol decided to go home and prepare for his journey, but the </div><div class="t m285 x4a h1a y589 ff4 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">voice compelled him to begin his journey at once. </div><div class="t m42e x14 h1a y58a ff4 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">He began to walk, and soon found himself standing on a </div><div class="t m42f x4a h1a y58b ff4 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">crossroad, where roads stretched out in every direction. On one </div><div class="t mc0 x4a h1a y58c ff4 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">road he could see a church. The voice asked him which road he </div><div class="t m53 x4a h1a y58d ff4 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">should take, and Datu Mangol said, &quot;The road to the church.&quot; The </div><div class="t m8a x4a h1a y58e ff4 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">voice assured him that was the way God wanted him to go. </div><div class="t m430 x14 h1a y58f ff4 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">In Datu Mangol&apos;s society dreams have great significance. </div><div class="t m431 x4a h1a y404 ff4 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Datu Mangol studied his dream carefully to determine the </div><div class="t m432 x4a h1a y590 ff4 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">meaning.
