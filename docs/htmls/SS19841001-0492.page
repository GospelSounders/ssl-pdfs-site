His eyes were as a flame of fire, and on his head were many </div><div class="t m7d1 x4 h2e y5ed ff6 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">crowns; and he had a name written, that no man knew, but he himself.

The rider under the first seal of Rev-</div><div class="t mfa x4 h2f ya0b ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">elation 6 rides on a white horse. Clearly the idea conveyed by this symbol </div><div class="t m593 x84 h2f ya0c ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">is that of triumph or accomplishment of purpose. The identity of the rider </div><div class="t ma5 x84 h2f y8b ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in Revelation 19 is certain. He is called &quot;Faithful and True.&quot; He is also a </div><div class="t m7d3 x4 h2f y5f5 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">righteous judge. Remember Jesus&apos; words: &quot;The Father judgeth no man, </div><div class="t m608 x4 h2f y690 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">but hath committed all judgment unto the Son&quot; (John 5:22). The Son is </div><div class="t m7d4 x4 h2f y8d ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">therefore God&apos;s agent or emissary. It is given to Him to wage war against </div><div class="t m7d x4 h2f y8e ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the forces of evil and to bring the rebellious to judgment—in short, to </div><div class="t m2c0 x4 h2f ya0d ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">settle accounts. The fact that He is crowned with many crowns indicates </div><div class="t m39d x4 h2f y90 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that universal dominion is now His. He is Lord of history (past, present, </div><div class="t m7d5 x4 h2f y91 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and future), of nations and kingdoms; all systems, social and political, </div><div class="t m416 x4 h2f ya0e ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">come under His rule. There is nothing in all creation that is excluded from </div><div class="t m7a6 x4 h2f ya0f ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">His realm. </div><div class="t m204 xa6 h2e ya10 ff6 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">What details are added by the prophet Isaiah? Isa. 63:1-6. </div><div class="t m6a1 xa6 h2f ya11 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Edom is symbolic of the enemies of God&apos;s people who have harassed </div><div class="t m5c4 x4 h2f ya12 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">them through the centuries of time in one form or another. A victorious </div><div class="t m707 x4 h2f ya13 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">conqueror coming from Edom would mean relief for Israel. In this pas-</div><div class="t m388 x4 h2f ya14 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sage also the identity of the conqueror is certain—&quot;I that speak in righ-</div><div class="t m70d x4 h2f ya15 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">teousness, mighty to save&quot; (Isa. 63:1). The striking similarity between </div><div class="t m2c0 x4 h2f ya16 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the Isaiah and Revelation descriptions is continued with reference to the </div><div class="t m5aa x4 h2f ya17 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">blood-stained garments or vesture of the conqueror. Redemption—to </div><div class="t m65a x4 h2f ya18 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">purchase back, to retrieve what was lost—requires strength. The Lamb is </div><div class="t m7d6 x4 h2f ya19 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">also the Lion. In fact, the wrath of the Lamb is a terror to the enemies of </div><div class="t m678 x4 h2f ya1a ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the Lord. The thought to keep in mind here is that mediation, as far as </div><div class="t m1af x4 h2f ya1b ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">salvation history is concerned, is not complete until the rebellion is effec-</div><div class="t m2bf x4 h2f y699 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tively put down. </div><div class="t m160 x5a h2f y69a ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The Mediator accomplishes all of this alone. The disciples forsook Him </div><div class="t m1c3 x4 h2f ya1c ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and fled. On the cross darkness enshrouded Him, intensifying His loneli-</div><div class="t m7d7 x4 h2f ya1d ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ness. He accepted His baptism of blood and trial by fire that countless </div><div class="t m572 x4 h2f ya1e ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">millions might gain everlasting life. The triumph becomes all the more </div><div class="t m421 x4 h2f ya1f ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">rewarding for it.
