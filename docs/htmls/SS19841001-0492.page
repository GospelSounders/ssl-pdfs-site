His eyes were as a flame of fire, and on his head were many </div><div class="t m7d1 x5 h31 y5ee ff6 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">crowns; and he had a name written, that no man knew, but he himself. And </div><div class="t m726 x5 h31 y5ef ff6 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">he was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood: and his name is called The </div><div class="t m7d2 x5 h31 ya0a ff6 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Word of God&quot; (Rev. 19:11-13). </div><div class="t m101 xa7 h32 ya0b ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">This passage is rich in symbolism. The rider under the first seal of Rev-</div><div class="t mfa x5 h32 ya0c ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">elation 6 rides on a white horse. Clearly the idea conveyed by this symbol </div><div class="t m593 x85 h32 ya0d ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">is that of triumph or accomplishment of purpose. The identity of the rider </div><div class="t ma5 x85 h32 y8c ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in Revelation 19 is certain. He is called &quot;Faithful and True.&quot; He is also a </div><div class="t m7d3 x5 h32 y5f6 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">righteous judge. Remember Jesus&apos; words: &quot;The Father judgeth no man, </div><div class="t m608 x5 h32 y691 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">but hath committed all judgment unto the Son&quot; (John 5:22). The Son is </div><div class="t m7d4 x5 h32 y8e ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">therefore God&apos;s agent or emissary. It is given to Him to wage war against </div><div class="t m7d x5 h32 y8f ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the forces of evil and to bring the rebellious to judgment—in short, to </div><div class="t m2c0 x5 h32 ya0e ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">settle accounts. The fact that He is crowned with many crowns indicates </div><div class="t m39d x5 h32 y91 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that universal dominion is now His. He is Lord of history (past, present, </div><div class="t m7d5 x5 h32 y92 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and future), of nations and kingdoms; all systems, social and political, </div><div class="t m416 x5 h32 ya0f ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">come under His rule. There is nothing in all creation that is excluded from </div><div class="t m7a6 x5 h32 ya10 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">His realm. </div><div class="t m204 xa7 h31 ya11 ff6 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">What details are added by the prophet Isaiah? Isa. 63:1-6. </div><div class="t m6a1 xa7 h32 ya12 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Edom is symbolic of the enemies of God&apos;s people who have harassed </div><div class="t m5c4 x5 h32 ya13 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">them through the centuries of time in one form or another. A victorious </div><div class="t m707 x5 h32 ya14 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">conqueror coming from Edom would mean relief for Israel. In this pas-</div><div class="t m388 x5 h32 ya15 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sage also the identity of the conqueror is certain—&quot;I that speak in righ-</div><div class="t m70d x5 h32 ya16 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">teousness, mighty to save&quot; (Isa. 63:1). The striking similarity between </div><div class="t m2c0 x5 h32 ya17 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the Isaiah and Revelation descriptions is continued with reference to the </div><div class="t m5aa x5 h32 ya18 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">blood-stained garments or vesture of the conqueror. Redemption—to </div><div class="t m65a x5 h32 ya19 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">purchase back, to retrieve what was lost—requires strength. The Lamb is </div><div class="t m7d6 x5 h32 ya1a ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">also the Lion. In fact, the wrath of the Lamb is a terror to the enemies of </div><div class="t m678 x5 h32 ya1b ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the Lord. The thought to keep in mind here is that mediation, as far as </div><div class="t m1af x5 h32 ya1c ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">salvation history is concerned, is not complete until the rebellion is effec-</div><div class="t m2bf x5 h32 y69a ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tively put down. </div><div class="t m160 x5b h32 y69b ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The Mediator accomplishes all of this alone. The disciples forsook Him </div><div class="t m1c3 x5 h32 ya1d ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and fled. On the cross darkness enshrouded Him, intensifying His loneli-</div><div class="t m7d7 x5 h32 ya1e ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ness. He accepted His baptism of blood and trial by fire that countless </div><div class="t m572 x5 h32 ya1f ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">millions might gain everlasting life. The triumph becomes all the more </div><div class="t m421 x5 h32 ya20 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">rewarding for it.
