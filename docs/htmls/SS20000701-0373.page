But it was too dangerous for outsiders </div><div class="t m269 x6d h17 y663 ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to travel the roads around Samrong, where Samithy lived. Many </div><div class="t m62 x6d h17 y5e5 ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">unwary travelers had been killed by bandits or renegade soldiers. </div><div class="t m36a x6d h17 y664 ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">In addition, it was the height of the rainy season, and the road was </div><div class="t m177 x6d h17 y665 ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">often flooded, making travel nearly impossible. </div><div class="t m241 x22 h17 y101 ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">But the urgent plea for help came after Samithy encountered a </div><div class="t m157 x6d h17 y666 ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">number of orphans as he visited people.
