His work was fulfilling, but he felt spiritually empty. He needed a </div><div class="t m613 x4a h11 y8ae ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">relationship with God, but church attendance disappointed him. </div><div class="t m66 x49 h11 y8af ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">One day while driving to an appointment, the need to seek God </div><div class="t m5a7 x4a h11 y8b0 ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">became so overwhelming that Wilba ordered his driver to stop the car. </div><div class="t m69a x4a h11 y8b1 ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;God has called me, and I must obey!&quot; he said later. He returned home a </div><div class="t m248 x4a h11 y8b2 ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">different man. His only desire was to find God. He fasted and prayed </div><div class="t m69b x4a h11 y8b3 ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that God would show him a church that follows the Bible. </div><div class="t m69c x49 h11 y8b4 ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">One day he met a man selling books on the street. He asked the man </div><div class="t m69d x1c h11 y8b5 ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">what church he represented, and the man named the Adventist church. </div><div class="t m155 x1c h11 ya6 ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Wilba knew nothing about this church, but something about this man </div><div class="t m5f4 x1c h11 ya7 ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">impressed him. Wilba invited him to his home. </div><div class="t m13 x1d h11 y8b6 ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The man invited Wilba&apos;s family to visit the Adventist church, but </div><div class="t m69e x1c h11 y8b7 ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Wilba hesitated. However, his wife urged him to give the church a try. </div><div class="t m69d x1d h11 y8b8 ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Wilba found the worship service compelling. The people sang with </div><div class="t m23c x1c h11 y8b9 ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">such enthusiasm, and the sermon was straight from the Bible. But the </div><div class="t m29a x1c h11 y106 ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">fellowship among believers touched him most. The family decided to </div><div class="t m69f x1c h11 y107 ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">return. </div><div class="t m6a0 x1d h11 y8ba ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">When the pastor visited the family the following week, Wilba asked </div><div class="t m6a1 x1c h11 y108 ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">him, &quot;Why do you worship on Saturday instead of Sunday?&quot; The pastor </div><div class="t m50e x1c h11 y8bb ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">showed Wilba Bible texts regarding the Sabbath. As they studied, God </div><div class="t m6a2 x1c h11 y10a ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">opened Wilba&apos;s eyes. He wondered how so many could be wrong when </div><div class="t m6a3 x1c h11 y18b ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the Bible was so clear. In the face of the evidence, Wilba knew he must </div><div class="t m6a4 x1c h11 y10b ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">obey. He quit working on Saturdays so he could attend church. </div><div class="t m3ac x1d h11 y8bc ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Wilba&apos;s boss, the prime minister, asked him why he no longer </div><div class="t m6a5 x1c h11 y8bd ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">attended meetings on Saturdays. Wilba explained that God commands </div><div class="t m8a x1c h11 y8be ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">His followers to worship Him on the seventh day, the Sabbath, and he </div><div class="t m6a6 x1c h11 y8bf ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">had to obey. </div><div class="t m122 x1d h11 y8c0 ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The prime minister told him that if he wished to worship God on </div><div class="t m7b x1c h11 y8c1 ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Saturday he should quit his job.
