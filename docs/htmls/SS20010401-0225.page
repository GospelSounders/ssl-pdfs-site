For the biographies of Noah and Job, the settings </div><div class="t m317 xc h29 y28e ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">must be understood before the plot makes sense. </div><div class="t m318 x67 hc y290 ff6 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The Bible gives background information for Noah&apos;s story: &quot;The </div><div class="t m319 xc hc y291 ff6 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Lord saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and </div><div class="t m31a xc hc y380 ff6 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil </div><div class="t m246 xc hc y381 ff6 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">continually&quot; (Gen. 6:5, RSV); for Job&apos;s narrative: &quot;Now there was </div><div class="t m31b xc hc y382 ff6 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the </div><div class="t m312 xc hc y294 ff6 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Lord, and Satan also came among them&quot; (Job 1:6, RSV).
