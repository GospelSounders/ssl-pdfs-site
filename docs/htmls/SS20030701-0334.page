Instead, the apostle links His superiority to, </div><div class="t m278 xe hc y435 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">interestingly enough, His &quot;inferiority.&quot; </div><div class="t m39f x1a hb y436 ff5 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Look at Hebrews 2:9. What does it teach us about the link </div><div class="t m1ea xe hb y3b0 ff5 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">between &quot;inferiority&quot; and &quot;superiority&quot;? See also Phil. 2:4-9. </div><div class="t m27e x1a hc y437 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">In Acts 10:36, Peter presents Jesus as Lord of all.
