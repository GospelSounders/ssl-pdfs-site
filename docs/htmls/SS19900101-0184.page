KINDNESS WINS ONE AND LOSES ANOTHER (Matt. 26:1-16). </div><div class="t m229 x15 hc y973 ff3 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The stage was set in a wealthy home around a banquet table at which </div><div class="t m409 x1f hc yaeb ff3 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">reclined the honored guest, the Messiah and future King. Around Him </div><div class="t m56 x1f hc yaec ff3 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">were His twelve future princes, each of whom coveted the highest place in </div><div class="t m32a x1f hc yaed ff3 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the kingdom. His host was a familiar personage to those in Jerusalemâ€”</div><div class="t m4fd x1f hc yaee ff3 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">wealthy, prestigious, competent in legal matters, but recently a changed </div><div class="t m153 x1f hc yaef ff3 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">man, the product of one of the King&apos;s miracles. And there were others, but </div><div class="t m21c x1f hc yaf0 ff3 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">they were supposed to remain in the kitchen, out of sight. </div><div class="t m4d4 x15 hc yaf1 ff3 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Mary, the sister of Lazarus and Martha, seemingly oblivious to the </div><div class="t m585 x1f hc yaf2 ff3 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;pious&quot; judgments of the assembled guests, crept into the dining room </div><div class="t m4f3 x1f hc yaf3 ff3 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">where the guests were reclining at the table, broke an expensive flask of </div><div class="t m85 x1f hc yaf4 ff3 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">extravagant perfume, and poured it on Jesus&apos; feet, wiping them with her </div><div class="t m221 x1f hc yaf5 ff3 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">long hair and washing them with her tears of love. </div><div class="t m120 x15 hc yaf6 ff3 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Though she did not intend anyone but Jesus to notice, the strong scent </div><div class="t m19a x1f hc y97b ff3 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">soon betrayed her presence. Immediately, the. disciples and the host, </div><div class="t m21b x1f hc y97c ff3 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Simon, began to list their legal judgments. Surely, if Jesus knew her past, </div><div class="t mce x1f hc yaf7 ff3 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">He would have nothing to do with such a woman. </div><div class="t md4 x15 hc yaf8 ff3 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Judas&apos; objection seemed very much to the point: &quot; &apos;Why this waste? </div><div class="t m159 x1f hc y980 ff3 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">For this ointment might have been sold for a large sum, and given to the </div><div class="t m9 x1f hc yaf9 ff3 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">poor&apos; &quot; (Matt. 26:8, 9, RSV; compare John 12:4-6). </div><div class="t m37f x1f hd yafa ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">1. </div><div class="t mb3 x15 hd yafa ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">How did.

There is </div><div class="t m114 x1f hc yafd ff3 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">nothing so heartless and cruel as condemnation of those whom Christ </div><div class="t m243 x1f hc ya12 ff3 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">has forgiven and redeemed. Since Christ no longer condemns believers </div><div class="t m172 x1f hc yafe ff3 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">(Rom. 8:1), what right do we have to remember their sins against them? </div><div class="t m387 x1f hd yaff ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">2. </div><div class="t m49c x15 hd yaff ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">What was the result of Jesus&apos; commendation of Mary?

But had Christ unmasked Judas, </div><div class="t m1f7 x1f hc yb04 ff3 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">this would have been urged as a reason for the betrayal. And though </div><div class="t m5c1 x1f hc yb05 ff3 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">charged with being a thief, Judas would have gained sympathy, even </div><div class="t m5c2 x1f hc yb06 ff3 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">among the disciples. The Saviour reproached him not, and thus avoided </div><div class="t m42c x1f hc yb07 ff3 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">giving him an excuse for his treachery. </div><div class="t m419 x15 hc yb08 ff3 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;But the look which Jesus cast upon Judas convinced him that the </div><div class="t m5c3 x1f hc yb09 ff3 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Saviour penetrated his hypocrisy, and read his base, contemptible </div><div class="t m5c4 x1f hc yb0a ff3 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">character. And in commending Mary&apos;s action, which had been so </div><div class="t m315 x1f hc yb0b ff3 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">severely condemned, Christ had rebuked Judas. Prior to this, the Saviour </div><div class="t m5c5 x1f hc yb0c ff3 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">had never given him a direct rebuke.
