One meeting in exchange for his brother&apos;s work was a </div><div class="t m50c x9 h2c y610 ff6 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">good deal. </div><div class="t m50d x20 h2c y611 ff6 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The meeting awakened in Heiner warm memories of his childhood </div><div class="t m202 x9 h2c y612 ff6 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">when he had attended the Adventist Church with his mother and </div><div class="t m50e x9 h2c y613 ff6 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">brothers. But he had not been to church for 20 years. Heiner returned </div><div class="t m2d6 x9 h2c y614 ff6 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the next night and every night of the series. Following the meetings </div><div class="t m50f x9 h2c y615 ff6 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Heiner was baptized. Then the brothers began praying for Heiner&apos;s </div><div class="t m510 x9 h2c y616 ff6 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">wife, Carola. A year later, in 1982, she was baptized. </div><div class="t m511 x20 h2c y5c9 ff6 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Heiner wanted to share his faith with others but was not sure how </div><div class="t mb8 xb7 h1b y617 ff4 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to </div><div class="t m368 x9 h2c y618 ff6 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">start. He placed an ad in the local newspaper, inviting anyone inter-</div><div class="t m512 x9 h2c y619 ff6 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ested in reading the Bible to come to his home. Soon he had a small </div><div class="t m130 x9 h2c y61a ff6 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">group meeting each week. After several weeks three persons were </div><div class="t m513 x9 h2c y5d ff6 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">baptized. Heiner and Carola prayed for three new persons to take their </div><div class="t m2e2 x9 h2c y61b ff6 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">places. </div><div class="t m1e4 x59 h2c y61c ff6 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">In thel6 years since they began their home Bible meetings, Heiner </div><div class="t m3da x36 h2c y61d ff6 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and Carola have seen 50 persons join the family of God. They came </div><div class="t m514 x36 h2c y61e ff6 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">because they saw the newspaper ad or were invited by friends. </div><div class="t m308 x59 h2c y61f ff6 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Heiner and Carola have started a new church in a neighboring </div><div class="t m515 x36 h2c y5d1 ff6 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">town. One family who came was from Kenya. They were baptized and </div><div class="t m516 x36 h2c yee ff6 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">eventually returned to Kenya, where they started a new church. </div><div class="t m517 x59 h2c y620 ff6 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Heiner and Carola are working with four small groups. The work </div><div class="t m3ca x36 h2c y621 ff6 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">has grown so large that Heiner now trains other church members to </div><div class="t m518 x36 h2c y622 ff6 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">lead out in some of the groups.
