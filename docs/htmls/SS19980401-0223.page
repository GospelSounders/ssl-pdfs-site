He was scheduled to </div><div class="t m2b2 x3b h1b y2fd ff3 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">begin evangelistic meetings there the next day. Everything was </div><div class="t m45 x3b h1b y2fe ff3 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ready, but the believers wanted to postpone the meetings. </div><div class="t m2b3 x3c h1b y2ff ff3 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;It is the time of the annual feast to Olo, a powerful voodoo </div><div class="t m2b4 x3b h1b y300 ff3 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">god,&quot; one man reported. &quot;Olo requires a human sacrifice, but his </div><div class="t m2b5 x3b h1b y301 ff3 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">followers have not yet found a victim to sacrifice. Until the feast is </div><div class="t m2b6 x3b h1b y302 ff3 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">over, the villagers are afraid to go out after dark. If we start the </div><div class="t md1 x3b h1b y303 ff3 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">meetings now, no one will come. It is even unsafe for you, pastor, </div><div class="t m2b7 x3b h1b y304 ff3 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and the church members to be out at night. We think it is best to </div><div class="t m2b8 x3b h1b y305 ff3 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">wait until the feast is over to begin the meetings.&quot; Pastor Charles </div><div class="t m2b9 x3b h1b y306 ff3 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">agreed to the plan. His heart ached for these people bound by fear </div><div class="t m2ba x3b h1b y307 ff3 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and superstition. </div><div class="t m240 x17 h1b y308 ff3 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The next week the followers of Olo had sacrificed three men to </div><div class="t m2bb x3b h1b y309 ff3 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">their fetish god and thus completed their ceremonies.

A small generator provided power for lights and a </div><div class="t m18d x22 h1b y30d ff3 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">loudspeaker. Night by night people came to the meetings, but they </div><div class="t m2bd x22 h1b y30e ff3 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">did not sit in the chairs provided. Instead they stood just outside </div><div class="t m165 x22 h1b y30f ff3 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the circle of light so they would not be seen. During question-and-</div><div class="t m27a x22 h1b y310 ff3 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">answer time, however, the people&apos;s curiosity drew them out of the </div><div class="t m196 x22 h1b y311 ff3 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">shadows. Soon the seating area was filled, and many more stood </div><div class="t m2be x22 h1b y312 ff3 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">around the sides. Pastor Charles presented a stirring message from </div><div class="t m92 x22 h1b y313 ff3 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the Bible as myriads of huge insects swarmed about the lights </div><div class="t m71 x22 h1b y314 ff3 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">overhead and fell on him. </div><div class="t m2bf x8b h1b y315 ff3 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">At the end of the series, two young men were baptized.
