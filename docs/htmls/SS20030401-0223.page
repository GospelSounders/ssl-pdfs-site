H. Zachary </div><div class="t m2d3 x18 h11 y1da ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Valentina grew up in a village near Rostov-on-Don, Russia. Her </div><div class="t m2d4 x3c h11 y1db ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">life was centered on the Orthodox church, which she believed was the </div><div class="t m2d5 x3c h11 y1dc ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">only true church. In spite of this, she never owned or read a Bible. </div><div class="t m2d6 x18 h11 y1dd ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">One day a neighbor invited Valentina to visit her church. She </div><div class="t m2d7 x3c h11 y1de ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">agreed. However, the service was so alien to her understanding of a </div><div class="t m2d8 x3c h11 y29f ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">worship service that she felt awkward, as if she was going against </div><div class="t m2d9 x3c h11 y1e0 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">God. Valentina feared that God was very angry with her and would </div><div class="t m2da x17 h11 y1e1 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">punish her for attending the church. </div><div class="t m2db x18 h11 y1e2 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Her friend gave her a Bible. Valentina took it, but later she decided </div><div class="t m2dc x17 h11 y1e3 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to sell the dangerous heretical book. When she was offered another </div><div class="t m2dd x17 h11 y1e4 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">book, called </div><div class="t m2de x92 h11 y1e4 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The </div><div class="t m2df x47 h24 y2a0 ff6 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Great Controversy, </div><div class="t m131 x4c h11 y2a0 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">she refused to take it. </div><div class="t m2e0 x18 h11 y1e5 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Then tragedy struck. Within a few weeks Valentina&apos;s sister, then </div><div class="t m2e1 x17 h11 y2a1 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">her brother, died. She wept bitterly and asked God, &quot;Why don&apos;t You </div><div class="t m55 x17 h11 y1e7 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">love me?&quot; </div><div class="t md5 x18 h11 y2a2 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Valentina&apos;s Adventist friend attended her brother&apos;s funeral and </div><div class="t m2e2 x17 h11 y1e9 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">later visited her at home. She introduced Valentina to a missionary </div><div class="t m2e3 x17 h11 y2a3 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">couple who had recently moved to town. They also visited Valentina </div><div class="t m2e4 x17 h11 y1eb ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and prayed for her. Hope began to return to Valentina. The three </div><div class="t m13e x17 h11 y2a4 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">friends shared precious Bible promises that proved God&apos;s love and </div><div class="t m2e5 x68 h11 y1ec ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">revealed His plan to return for those who love Him. </div><div class="t m2e6 x18 h11 y2a5 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">It was difficult for Valentina to abandon her lifelong faith and her </div><div class="t m1e8 x68 h11 y2a6 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">precious icons. At first she thought that if she did, she would be </div><div class="t m2e7 x68 h11 y2a7 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">denying God. But little by little Valentina saw that personal faith in </div><div class="t m16 x68 h11 y1f0 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the Lord and His promises were the source of peace and salvation. </div><div class="t m2e8 x1f h11 y2a8 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">She began attending the Adventist church in a neighboring town. It </div><div class="t m2e9 x68 h11 y1f2 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was difficult to adjust her thinking to observe the Sabbath and to focus </div><div class="t m2ea x68 h11 y2a9 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">her worship on the God revealed through Bible study. She joined a </div><div class="t m2eb x68 h11 y2aa ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">small group that met in her village. As they studied and prayed </div><div class="t ma4 x68 h11 y2ab ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">together, her life changed. Her heart was filled with peace. She </div><div class="t m2ec x68 h11 y1f6 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">relaxed in the knowledge of God&apos;s love for her. Valentina began to </div><div class="t m2ed x68 h11 y2ac ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">reach out to others. </div><div class="t m2ee x1f h11 y2ad ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">There are only five Adventists in Valentina&apos;s village. Their burden </div><div class="t m2ef x68 h11 y2ae ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">is to share Jesus with their neighbors. They are patient, for they </div><div class="t m2f0 x68 h11 y2af ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">understand how difficult it is for people to leave their lifelong reli-</div><div class="t m2f1 x68 h11 y2b0 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">gious traditions.
