Read </div><div class="t m3bd x76 hd y46a ff5 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Hebrews 11:4. What is it saying here about Abel? What was his </div><div class="t m1b2 x4b hd y46b ff5 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;better&quot; sacrifice? See Genesis 4:1-8. </div><div class="t m2be x4a he y46c ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Abel is found twice in Hebrews. Abel honored God in bringing a </div><div class="t m5a x4b he y46d ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">better sacrifice than what Cain offered (11:4). In Hebrews 12:24, </div><div class="t m3be x4b he y46e ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Jesus&apos; blood is compared to that of Abel, who had a faith relationship </div><div class="t m30e x4b he y46f ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to God and is called righteous.

Abel is the first hero of faith in Hebrews 11 and </div><div class="t m1c8 x4b he y472 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the first martyr. Jesus, nevertheless, far surpasses him. </div><div class="t m15c x38 hd y473 ff5 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Read Hebrews 11:25.
