But during his later teen years </div><div class="t m2ae x70 hb y524 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Chinsisi dropped out of school before he graduated. His church </div><div class="t m443 x70 hb y525 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">attendance became sporadic, and he began smoking and drinking. </div><div class="t m11f x24 hb y526 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">When his parents died in 1993, Chinsisi turned even more to </div><div class="t m47f x70 hb y527 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">drinking to help him forget the troubles at home and the needs of </div><div class="t m2a0 x3d hb y528 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">his younger brothers. </div><div class="t mbf x24 hb y529 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">That left Yami, 18 and just out of high school, to take on the </div><div class="t m481 x3d hb y52a ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">role of parent to his brothers. Yami found a job and began support-</div><div class="t m482 x3d hb y52b ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ing his brothers.

He taught them to love Jesus, and he trusted in the </div><div class="t mab x65 hb y52f ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Lord to do for them what Yami could not do. During this time </div><div class="t m345 x3d hb y530 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Yami never forgot his older brother. </div><div class="t m68 x4d hb y531 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">When the young adults in his church in Blantyre called for a </div><div class="t m1d8 x3d hb y532 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">day of fasting and prayer on behalf of one of their members who </div><div class="t m3da x3d hb y533 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was facing Sabbath problems at work, Yami joined in. The young </div><div class="t m10c x65 hb y534 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">people sang and prayed. But as the Holy Spirit moved upon their </div><div class="t m1f6 x65 hb y535 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">hearts, they began sharing and praying for one another&apos;s burdens </div><div class="t m1b4 x65 hb yef ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">as well. As members of the group expressed personal needs, </div><div class="t m2a0 x65 hb y536 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">others in the group prayed for them by name. </div><div class="t m484 x49 hb y50f ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">During this time of sharing, Yami told the group of his burden </div><div class="t m35f x65 hb y537 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">for his brother Chinsisi, who had been the spiritual influence that </div><div class="t m47b x65 hb y538 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">had brought him to Christ. He related how Chinsisi had drifted </div><div class="t m270 x65 hb y539 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">from the Lord and from his family. He asked his friends to pray </div><div class="t m3d4 x65 hb y53a ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that Chinsisi would come home. Yami was comforted as his friends </div><div class="t m226 x65 hb y53b ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">took his burden to God. </div><div class="t m485 x49 hb y53c ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">A few months later, during Christmas, Chinsisi returned to </div><div class="t m1b9 x65 hb yf4 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Blantyre and was reunited with his joyful brothers.
