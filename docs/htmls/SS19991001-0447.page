It </div><div class="t m480 x71 hd y523 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was Chinsisi&apos;s influence that inspired his next-younger brother, </div><div class="t m28 x71 hd y524 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Yami, to become a Christian. But during his later teen years </div><div class="t m2ae x71 hd y525 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Chinsisi dropped out of school before he graduated. His church </div><div class="t m443 x71 hd y526 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">attendance became sporadic, and he began smoking and drinking. </div><div class="t m11f x25 hd y527 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">When his parents died in 1993, Chinsisi turned even more to </div><div class="t m47f x71 hd y528 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">drinking to help him forget the troubles at home and the needs of </div><div class="t m2a0 x3e hd y529 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">his younger brothers. </div><div class="t mbf x25 hd y52a ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">That left Yami, 18 and just out of high school, to take on the </div><div class="t m481 x3e hd y52b ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">role of parent to his brothers. Yami found a job and began support-</div><div class="t m482 x3e hd y52c ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ing his brothers.

He taught them to love Jesus, and he trusted in the </div><div class="t mab x66 hd y530 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Lord to do for them what Yami could not do. During this time </div><div class="t m345 x3e hd y531 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Yami never forgot his older brother. </div><div class="t m68 x4e hd y532 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">When the young adults in his church in Blantyre called for a </div><div class="t m1d8 x3e hd y533 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">day of fasting and prayer on behalf of one of their members who </div><div class="t m3da x3e hd y534 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was facing Sabbath problems at work, Yami joined in. The young </div><div class="t m10c x66 hd y535 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">people sang and prayed. But as the Holy Spirit moved upon their </div><div class="t m1f6 x66 hd y536 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">hearts, they began sharing and praying for one another&apos;s burdens </div><div class="t m1b4 x66 hd yf0 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">as well. As members of the group expressed personal needs, </div><div class="t m2a0 x66 hd y537 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">others in the group prayed for them by name. </div><div class="t m484 x4a hd y510 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">During this time of sharing, Yami told the group of his burden </div><div class="t m35f x66 hd y538 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">for his brother Chinsisi, who had been the spiritual influence that </div><div class="t m47b x66 hd y539 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">had brought him to Christ. He related how Chinsisi had drifted </div><div class="t m270 x66 hd y53a ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">from the Lord and from his family. He asked his friends to pray </div><div class="t m3d4 x66 hd y53b ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that Chinsisi would come home. Yami was comforted as his friends </div><div class="t m226 x66 hd y53c ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">took his burden to God. </div><div class="t m485 x4a hd y53d ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">A few months later, during Christmas, Chinsisi returned to </div><div class="t m1b9 x66 hd yf5 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Blantyre and was reunited with his joyful brothers. During the </div><div class="t m486 x66 hd y53e ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">long conversations that followed, Yami learned that within two </div><div class="t m1e4 x66 hd y53f ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">weeks of the day of fasting and prayer, Chinsisi had given up </div><div class="t m487 x66 hd y540 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">smoking and drinking.
