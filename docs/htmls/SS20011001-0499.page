Whichever altar, however, one thing is sure: God&apos;s righteous </div><div class="t m4e4 x1a h22 y7b3 ff3 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">judgment is about to fall on an unrighteous people. </div><div class="t m8c x1b hd y8b2 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">What point does the Lord seem to be making in Amos 9:1? </div><div class="t mbf x1b h22 y273 ff3 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">One truth that comes through while reading the Bible is that God </div><div class="t m702 x78 h22 yf8 ff3 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">does not, in any way, tolerate sin. How could a perfectly righteous </div><div class="t m703 x1a h22 y3c9 ff3 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and holy God tolerate it, or even accept it? He, of course, does </div><div class="t mc1 x78 h22 y2ad ff3 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">neither. </div><div class="t m704 x29 h22 y276 ff3 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Instead—God is </div><div class="t m6f x2d h22 y276 ff5 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">patient </div><div class="t m705 x5 h22 y276 ff3 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">with sin. That&apos;s a crucial distinction. </div><div class="t m6ff x78 h22 y277 ff3 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Patience is not the same as toleration or acceptance. On the contrary. </div><div class="t m363 x78 h22 y8b3 ff3 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Ultimately, God will utterly obliterate sin from the universe forever. </div><div class="t m565 x78 h22 y279 ff3 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">His problem, however, is how to get rid of sin without getting rid of </div><div class="t m706 x78 h22 y77f ff3 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">those who have committed it. Here is where the Cross comes in, for at </div><div class="t m49e x78 h22 y547 ff3 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Calvary God was able to punish sin without punishing the sinner. </div><div class="t m707 x29 hd y595 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">What happened at the Cross that will enable God to, ulti-</div><div class="t m5f9 x78 hd y3d3 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">mately, destroy sin but not sinners? </div><div class="t m26e x29 h22 y8b4 ff3 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Unfortunately, not every sinner will be saved from his or her sins. </div><div class="t m5d5 x7c h22 y8b5 ff3 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The situation in Amos hints at this sad but stark reality. In the end, </div><div class="t m6d4 x7c h22 y8b6 ff3 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">every sin will be punished; the crucial question is, Who ultimately </div><div class="t m344 x7c h22 y8b7 ff3 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">faces that punishment? Through the Cross, God made a way for us to </div><div class="t m708 x7c h22 y8b8 ff3 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">escape that punishment ourselves, but only if we accept it. If not, </div><div class="t m709 x7c h22 y8b9 ff3 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">punishment will fall upon us. This is what&apos;s happening here in </div><div class="t m70a x7c h22 y8ba ff3 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Amos, at least on a small scale. Despite repeated attempts to turn </div><div class="t m6e6 x7c h22 y8bb ff3 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sinners away from their sin, they have chosen to remain in that sin. </div><div class="t m634 x7c h22 y8bc ff3 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Thus, in the end, when sin is destroyed, they will be, as well. </div><div class="t m70b x6d hd y8bd ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Read Matthew 25:41.
