H. Zachary </div><div class="t m629 x1a h23 y76e ff3 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Jason was nearing graduation from a university in Papua New </div><div class="t m1b6 x19 h23 y76f ff3 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Guinea. He was confident that he would find a good job. Then two </div><div class="t m701 x19 h23 y770 ff3 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">things happened that changed his life. </div><div class="t m702 x1a h23 y771 ff3 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Jason attended some evangelistic meetings and became convinced </div><div class="t mc3 x19 h23 y772 ff3 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of God&apos;s claim upon his life. He surrendered his life to the Lord. </div><div class="t m703 x1a h23 y773 ff3 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Following graduation Jason began searching for work. But with </div><div class="t m45b x19 h23 y774 ff3 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">only 30 percent of the population in Papua New Guinea employed, few </div><div class="t mc3 x19 h23 y775 ff3 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">employers were willing to honor his request for Sabbaths off. </div><div class="t m4da x1a h23 y776 ff3 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Jason asked God what he should do, and God answered. Jason was </div><div class="t m5b6 x19 h23 y777 ff3 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">convinced that God was calling him to share his faith among the </div><div class="t m45a x19 h23 y778 ff3 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">islands that dot the southern coastline of Papua New Guinea, a chal-</div><div class="t m704 x19 h23 y6b3 ff3 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">lenging and largely unentered area. Small villages dot tiny islands that </div><div class="t m111 x19 h23 y779 ff3 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">barely stand above the mud and water. The people suffer health </div><div class="t m5e1 x19 h23 y6b5 ff3 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">problems from their environment, and most cannot read or write. The </div><div class="t m160 x19 h23 y77a ff3 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">majority have never heard the good news about Jesus. </div><div class="t m705 x1a h23 y77b ff3 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">With only his Bible and the clothes he wore, Jason journeyed to his </div><div class="t m706 x6d h23 y18 ff3 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">island mission field. In the first village he made the people an offer. &quot;If </div><div class="t m707 x6d h23 y77c ff3 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">you will provide me with food and shelter and transportation costs, I </div><div class="t m24c x6d h23 y77d ff3 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">will teach you how to read.&quot; The villagers agreed. </div><div class="t m1a4 x1a h23 y77e ff3 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Using his Bible as a reading textbook, Jason set up class. Villagers </div><div class="t m2de x6d h23 y77f ff3 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">flocked to learn how to read. And as the light of literacy dawned on </div><div class="t m708 x6d h23 y780 ff3 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">them, the light of Bible truths dispelled their spiritual darkness. </div><div class="t m709 x1a h23 y781 ff3 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Soon Jason began Bible studies, and a number of villagers made </div><div class="t m70a x6d h23 y782 ff3 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">decisions to follow Christ. When a small group of believers was firmly </div><div class="t m1cd x6d h23 y783 ff3 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">established in this village, Jason moved on to the next island village, </div><div class="t m3ab x6d h23 y784 ff3 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">where he repeated his offer with equal success. </div><div class="t m5e7 x22 h23 y785 ff3 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">A mission worker learned of the work Jason was doing and asked </div><div class="t m245 x6d h23 y786 ff3 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">him, &quot;What supplies do you have for your work?&quot; </div><div class="t m70b x22 h23 y787 ff3 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Jason answered, &quot;I have my Bible.&quot; </div><div class="t m70a x22 h23 y788 ff3 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;What else?&quot; the man wanted to know. </div><div class="t m70c x22 h23 y789 ff3 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;I have Jesus.&quot; </div><div class="t m70d x22 h23 y78a ff3 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The pastor emptied his case of all the books and gave them to Jason </div><div class="t m70e x6d h23 ya0 ff3 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to enrich his teaching. Jason now receives a small stipend for his work. </div><div class="t m70f xa h23 y78b ff3 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">He is preparing some 500 people for baptism in the island villages of </div><div class="t m1c2 xa h23 y78c ff3 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">southern Papua New Guinea.
