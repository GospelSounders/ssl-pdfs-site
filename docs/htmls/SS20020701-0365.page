A single mother living in Peru, she worked </div><div class="t m151 x17 h33 y601 ff1 fs1d fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">long hours to provide for her teenage daughter, Angela,* and herself. </div><div class="t m1d1 x17 h33 y25d ff1 fs1d fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Maria worried as her innocent child became a rebellious teenager. </div><div class="t m50c x17 h33 y602 ff1 fs1d fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Maria seemed powerless to change the path Angela&apos;s life was taking. </div><div class="t m504 x17 h33 y25f ff1 fs1d fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Angela stayed out night after night, rebelling against Maria&apos;s values. </div><div class="t m3f6 x18 h33 y604 ff1 fs1d fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Then it happened.

She </div><div class="t m106 x17 h33 y605 ff1 fs1d fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tried to deny it, but the truth was evident: Her daughter had contracted </div><div class="t m60b x17 h33 y606 ff1 fs1d fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">AIDS. Heartbroken, Maria sought help to reverse her daughter&apos;s </div><div class="t m4a0 x17 h33 y740 ff1 fs1d fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">disease, but she found no help.

As I opened my desk </div><div class="t m1a4 x17 h33 y745 ff1 fs1d fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and removed the revolver, the clock radio came on, and a voice said, </div><div class="t m60c x17 h33 y633 ff1 fs1d fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">`In the midst of suffering and pain, Jesus understands, because He </div><div class="t m1f1 x17 h33 y270 ff1 fs1d fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">suffered just as we do.&apos; </div><div class="t m3f6 x18 h33 y60b ff1 fs1d fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;I sat down and listened.
