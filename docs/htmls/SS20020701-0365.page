A single mother living in Peru, she worked </div><div class="t m151 x16 h30 y600 ff1 fs1d fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">long hours to provide for her teenage daughter, Angela,* and herself. </div><div class="t m1d1 x16 h30 y25c ff1 fs1d fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Maria worried as her innocent child became a rebellious teenager. </div><div class="t m50c x16 h30 y601 ff1 fs1d fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Maria seemed powerless to change the path Angela&apos;s life was taking. </div><div class="t m504 x16 h30 y25e ff1 fs1d fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Angela stayed out night after night, rebelling against Maria&apos;s values. </div><div class="t m3f6 x17 h30 y603 ff1 fs1d fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Then it happened. Maria noticed Angela&apos;s health was failing. She </div><div class="t m106 x16 h30 y604 ff1 fs1d fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tried to deny it, but the truth was evident: Her daughter had contracted </div><div class="t m60b x16 h30 y605 ff1 fs1d fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">AIDS. Heartbroken, Maria sought help to reverse her daughter&apos;s </div><div class="t m4a0 x16 h30 y73f ff1 fs1d fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">disease, but she found no help.

Desperate, she decided to end her daughter&apos;s pain by killing </div><div class="t m1d0 x16 h30 y741 ff1 fs1d fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">her, then turn the gun on herself and end her own life. She purchased a </div><div class="t m71 x16 h30 y62e ff1 fs1d fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">gun and hid it in a desk drawer, awaiting the day that she had appointed </div><div class="t m477 x16 h30 y742 ff1 fs1d fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">for the murders. </div><div class="t m399 x17 h30 y2dc ff1 fs1d fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">On the given day, Maria opened the desk drawer and removed the </div><div class="t m4ee x16 h30 y62f ff1 fs1d fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">gun.

As I opened my desk </div><div class="t m1a4 x16 h30 y744 ff1 fs1d fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and removed the revolver, the clock radio came on, and a voice said, </div><div class="t m60c x16 h30 y632 ff1 fs1d fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">`In the midst of suffering and pain, Jesus understands, because He </div><div class="t m1f1 x16 h30 y26f ff1 fs1d fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">suffered just as we do.&apos; </div><div class="t m3f6 x17 h30 y60a ff1 fs1d fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;I sat down and listened.

The </div><div class="t m60d x16 h30 y270 ff1 fs1d fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">program ended with a phone number.
