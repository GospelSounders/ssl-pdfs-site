The Bible, </div><div class="t m5b3 x46 h1c ya0e ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Old and New Testaments, is filled with promises of all sorts of hope: </div><div class="t m22 x25 h1c ya0f ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">deliverance from enemies (Ps. 18:3), peace (Ps. 29:11), guidance (Ps. </div><div class="t m70e x25 h1c ya10 ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">48:14), and power to overcome sin (1 Cor. 10:13), to name only a few. </div><div class="t m3e5 x39 h14 y4d ff6 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">All these, as wonderful as they are, are not the &quot;one hope&quot; that Paul </div><div class="t ma8 x25 h14 ya11 ff6 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was talking about.
