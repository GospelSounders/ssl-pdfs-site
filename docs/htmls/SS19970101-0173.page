She lost her job and could not find another. She </div><div class="t m5d8 x5 h1a y49d ff4 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">became depressed and lost all hope for the future. She turned to </div><div class="t m16c x5 h1a y96f ff4 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">alcohol and tobacco to ease her pain. Each day she seemed to sink </div><div class="t m61 x5 h1a y177 ff4 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">lower into a pit of despondency.

She doubted it would help, but finally she </div><div class="t m233 x5 h1a y973 ff4 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">agreed to go just to see.

As she </div><div class="t m5cb x5 h1a y810 ff4 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">read one book about Jesus, she checked every reference in the Bible </div><div class="t m5db x5 h1a y23e ff4 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">she had received. &quot;I felt strangely warmed as I read. I could not put </div><div class="t m450 x5 h1a y976 ff4 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the books down.
