Nebuchadnezzar </div><div class="t m303 x20 h1c y587 ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">must have been impressed greatly by the tree he saw in his dream. It was a tree </div><div class="t m2e6 x20 h1c y588 ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that brought benefits to many creatures. To cut it down was not only a tragedy to </div><div class="t m317 x20 h1c y589 ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the tree, but a loss to the creatures who profited from its shade and branches. It is </div><div class="t m3bb x20 h1c y58a ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">no wonder that the king was troubled by the dream and wanted to know its; </div><div class="t m1f5 x20 h1c y58b ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">interpretation. </div><div class="t m3bc x9d h1d y58c ff1 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">How did what happened to the tree concern the king, and who gave the </div><div class="t m52 x20 h1d y58d ff1 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">verdict? Dan. 4: 13-17. </div><div class="t mab x9d h1c y44b ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">What happened to the tree was of immense concern to the king. Evidently </div><div class="t m398 x20 h1c y58e ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">some tragic event was to take place. But what was the meaning of the stump </div><div class="t m31 x20 h1c y44d ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">being bound with iron and bronze? What did the &quot;seven times&quot; mean? Who are </div><div class="t m3bd x20 h1c y58f ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the &quot;watchers,&quot; the &quot;holy ones&quot;? He needed a clear interpretation. </div><div class="t m193 x9d h1d y590 ff1 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">4. The Interpretation (Dan. 4:19-27). </div><div class="t m3be x9d h1c y82 ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The dream was not easy to interpret; not because of, its complexity but because </div><div class="t m35f x38 h1c y591 ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of its obvious import. Somebody was going to be hurt, and the hurt would come </div><div class="t m108 x38 h1c y592 ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">as the result of a decision made by an authority that could not be resisted. </div><div class="t m257 x9d h1d y593 ff1 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">How was Daniel affected as he contemplated the dream, and how did the </div><div class="t m222 x38 h1d y89 ff1 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">king encourage him? Dan. 4:19. </div><div class="t m68 x9d h1c y17a ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">It is not easy to tell a powerful king that he will lose his power. As is true of </div><div class="t m362 x38 h1c y594 ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">nearly everyone, kings like to hear good news, not bad. The good news was that </div><div class="t m170 x38 h1c y17d ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the marvelous tree represented Nebuchadnezzar himself. He was like a tall tree </div><div class="t m321 x38 h1c y4db ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that brought blessing to many. </div><div class="t m3bf x5c h1c y595 ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The bad news was that he would lose his power, lose his mind, and live like an </div><div class="t m1d7 x38 h1c y596 ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">animal for seven years. But he would be restored to power when he came to the </div><div class="t m3c0 x38 h1c y180 ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">place where he would acknowledge that the God of heaven is in command of </div><div class="t mcf x38 h1c y597 ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">everyone and everything. (See Daniel 4:24-26.) </div><div class="t m3c1 x5c h1c y598 ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Imagine how you would feel if you were King Nebuchadnezzar. Can you </div><div class="t m3c2 x38 h1c y1d6 ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">imagine how Daniel felt as he outlined the meaning of the dream to the King who </div><div class="t mc8 x38 h1c y599 ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">had always been good to him, who had expressed such confidence in him? </div><div class="t m133 x5c h1d y59a ff1 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">What does the way in which Daniel concluded his interpretation teach us </div><div class="t m2bb x1a h1d y1da ff1 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">about tactfulness? Dan. 4:27. </div><div class="t m128 x5c h1c y2d5 ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Daniel felt that he had to appeal to the king to renounce his sin, and do what </div><div class="t mdf x1a h1c y59b ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was right. There is only one attitude to take toward sin. That is to determine, by </div><div class="t m195 x1a h1c y2b5 ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">God&apos;s grace, not to sin. To continue in sin is to court disaster. </div><div class="t m3a5 x5c h1c y2d8 ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Up to this point we have not been told what the king&apos;s particular sin was. Later </div><div class="t m3c3 x1a h1c y59c ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">it is revealed that he indulged in pride of achievement. Naturally, he did not </div><div class="t m30b x1a h1c y59d ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">build Babylon with his own hands. Probably he used forced labor. It would be </div><div class="t m11a x1a h1c y59e ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">expected in those days that his inspectors and supervisors would be cruel to the </div><div class="t m1d0 x1a h1c y59f ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">laborers. Daniel suggested that the king change his policies and be kind to the </div><div class="t m269 x1a h1c y5a0 ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">oppressed. If he did this, there was a chance that he would continue to be blessed </div><div class="t m186 x1a h1c y5a1 ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of God and be prosperous. </div><div class="t m2e4 x1a h1d y5a2 ff1 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">40 </div></div><div class="pi" data-data='{"ctm":[1.000000,0.000000,0.000000,1.000000,0.000000,0.000000]}'></div></div>
