Soon it </div><div class="t m37e x1c h2b y3cf ff4 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">became impossible to hunt and work on my farm. Without any </div><div class="t m2d2 x1c h2b y2b0 ff4 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">family members nearby to help me, I lived by the mercy of kind </div><div class="t m37f x1c h2b y3d0 ff4 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">neighbors. </div><div class="t m281 x8d h2b y3d1 ff4 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">During the dry season, some health workers from Kamoto </div><div class="t m376 x1c h2b y2b1 ff4 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Hospital came to my village.

At night I slept in villages along the way. Some of the </div><div class="t m1fc x71 h2b y27a ff4 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">people I talked to encouraged me to go on, and others told me to </div><div class="t m26f x71 h2b y27b ff4 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">go home.
