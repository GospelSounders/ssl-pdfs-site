Soon it </div><div class="t m37e x1b h29 y3ce ff4 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">became impossible to hunt and work on my farm. Without any </div><div class="t m2d2 x1b h29 y2af ff4 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">family members nearby to help me, I lived by the mercy of kind </div><div class="t m37f x1b h29 y3cf ff4 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">neighbors. </div><div class="t m281 x8c h29 y3d0 ff4 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">During the dry season, some health workers from Kamoto </div><div class="t m376 x1b h29 y2b0 ff4 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Hospital came to my village.

At night I slept in villages along the way. Some of the </div><div class="t m1fc x70 h29 y279 ff4 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">people I talked to encouraged me to go on, and others told me to </div><div class="t m26f x70 h29 y27a ff4 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">go home.
