Thus have many of us prayed from our earliest </div><div class="t m73 x20 h1a y7f ff6 fs5 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">years, learning to say the words before we could understand them. </div><div class="t m74 x20 h1a y80 ff6 fs5 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">And still we fail to sense their full meaning for us, without a doubt. </div><div class="t m75 x21 h1a y81 ff6 fs5 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Behind the familiar words of the Lord&apos;s Prayer lie the age-long </div><div class="t m76 x20 h1a y82 ff6 fs5 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">conflict between Christ and Satan. All the relationships of the in-</div><div class="t m77 x20 h1a y83 ff6 fs5 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">habitants of the universe are involved. And on our small planet </div><div class="t m78 x20 h1a y84 ff6 fs5 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the way has been provided for those who will to return to seeking </div><div class="t m79 x20 h1a y85 ff6 fs5 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the glory of God. </div><div class="t m7a x22 h1a y86 ff6 fs5 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Satan&apos;s rebellion in heaven was the first challenge to the heart of </div><div class="t m7b x23 h1a y87 ff6 fs5 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">God&apos;s glory—to His character which reveals His perfect selfless love. </div><div class="t m7c x23 h1a y88 ff6 fs5 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">During this quarter we will seek to define God&apos;s glory, see it in the </div><div class="t m7d x23 h1a y89 ff6 fs5 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">person of God, see it in the face of Jesus. We will see how man lost his </div><div class="t m7e x23 h1a y8a ff6 fs5 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">reflection of God&apos;s glory in Eden. </div><div class="t m7f x22 h1a y8b ff6 fs5 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">We will see the cross providing the way back to God, the way to </div><div class="t m80 x23 h1a y8c ff6 fs5 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">seek His glory rather than our own. Restoration full and complete is </div><div class="t m81 x23 h1a y8d ff6 fs5 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">contemplated. We will consider the means and agencies that God has </div><div class="t m5d x23 h1a y8e ff6 fs5 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">provided for this purpose. We will hear our Lord in intercessory </div><div class="t m82 x23 h1a y8f ff6 fs5 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">prayer for His glory to be restored in us. </div><div class="t m83 x22 h1a y90 ff6 fs5 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">In the struggle and sometimes heartache of daily living, we too </div><div class="t m84 x23 h1a y91 ff6 fs5 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">easily forget our high calling. The home is one of the places where we </div><div class="t m85 x23 h1a y92 ff6 fs5 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">too often forget. God wants those homes restored to seeking His </div><div class="t m86 x23 h1a y93 ff6 fs5 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">glory. </div><div class="t m87 x24 h1a y94 ff6 fs5 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">From the Scriptures, we will note that God&apos;s people through the </div><div class="t m88 x23 h1a y95 ff6 fs5 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ages have been seeking His glory, some more earnestly than others. </div><div class="t mf x23 h1a y96 ff6 fs5 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">But only He knows the many who were faithful though unrecorded in </div><div class="t m89 x23 h1a y97 ff6 fs5 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the Word. He is looking for the final triumph of the remnant people as </div><div class="t m8a x23 h1a y98 ff6 fs5 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the controversy between good and evil sweeps to its climax. The </div><div class="t m8b x23 h1a y99 ff6 fs5 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">cross provides for victory all the way. And soon the glory—in the </div><div class="t m8c x23 h1a y9a ff6 fs5 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sense of awe, majesty, and power—of the advent will signal the close </div><div class="t m8d x23 h1a y9b ff6 fs5 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of the conflict. The redeemed of all ages will join the living saints in the </div><div class="t m8e x25 h1a y9c ff6 fs5 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">final triumph, not only of glory, but in the place and home of </div><div class="t m8f x23 h1a y9d ff6 fs5 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">glory. Then a unified universe will resume in unbroken measure the </div><div class="t m90 x25 h1a y9e ff6 fs5 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">unfailing seeking of the glory of God.
