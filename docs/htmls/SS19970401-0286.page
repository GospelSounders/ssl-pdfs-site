He was particularly con-</div><div class="t m2d3 x1a h13 y7ee ff3 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">cerned to counter the argument that Jesus was only a human being </div><div class="t m48a x1a h13 y9ae ff3 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">until His baptism, at which time Christ came down upon Him and </div><div class="t m489 x1a h13 y7f0 ff3 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">remained until shortly before His death.

In particular, how could God </div><div class="t m233 x1a h13 y9b0 ff3 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">become a human being?
