He </div><div class="t m2e3 x50 h2a y1c6 ff5 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">grew up in an Adventist home, but during his teens he drifted away </div><div class="t m56c x7c h2a y1c8 ff5 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">from the church. He dropped out of school and took a job as an auto </div><div class="t m600 x50 h2a y6ef ff5 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">mechanic. He was a good one and quickly became the supervisor of </div><div class="t m577 x50 h2a y1c9 ff5 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the repair shop. He thought he had everything he wanted from life. </div><div class="t m601 x67 h2a y1ca ff5 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">But a sudden and serious illness shattered his dreams. His doctor </div><div class="t m274 x7c h2a y786 ff5 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">gave him little hope for recovery and suggested that Beven should </div><div class="t m602 x7c h2a y6f0 ff5 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">prepare to die. </div><div class="t m2a3 x80 h2a y787 ff5 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Beven&apos;s family and friends began praying for him, and God </div><div class="t med x7c h2a y788 ff5 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">healed him. Beven returned to God and the church he had left as a </div><div class="t m603 x7c h2a y789 ff5 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">youth. He began telling others what God had done for him. Soon he </div><div class="t m7d x7c h2a y78a ff5 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">decided to quit his job as a mechanic and become a lay preacher, </div><div class="t m604 x7c h2a y78b ff5 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">even though he had no training in preaching or evangelism. </div><div class="t m605 x80 h2a y78c ff5 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">He wanted to share his faith with people who knew nothing about </div><div class="t m18c x7c h2a yc9 ff5 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Adventists. He chose Nagusa, a village in the remote mountains of </div><div class="t m5bb x7c h2a yca ff5 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Guadalcanal. He arrived in Nagusa and began sharing his faith. One </div><div class="t m19b x7c h2a y78d ff5 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">local man told Beven to leave the village. When Beven did not leave, </div><div class="t m4a1 x7c h2a y78e ff5 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the man beat him.
