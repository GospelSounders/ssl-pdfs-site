He </div><div class="t m2e3 x4f h27 y1c5 ff5 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">grew up in an Adventist home, but during his teens he drifted away </div><div class="t m56c x7b h27 y1c7 ff5 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">from the church. He dropped out of school and took a job as an auto </div><div class="t m600 x4f h27 y6ee ff5 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">mechanic. He was a good one and quickly became the supervisor of </div><div class="t m577 x4f h27 y1c8 ff5 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the repair shop. He thought he had everything he wanted from life. </div><div class="t m601 x66 h27 y1c9 ff5 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">But a sudden and serious illness shattered his dreams.

Soon he </div><div class="t m7d x7b h27 y789 ff5 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">decided to quit his job as a mechanic and become a lay preacher, </div><div class="t m604 x7b h27 y78a ff5 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">even though he had no training in preaching or evangelism. </div><div class="t m605 x7f h27 y78b ff5 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">He wanted to share his faith with people who knew nothing about </div><div class="t m18c x7b h27 yc8 ff5 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Adventists. He chose Nagusa, a village in the remote mountains of </div><div class="t m5bb x7b h27 yc9 ff5 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Guadalcanal. He arrived in Nagusa and began sharing his faith. One </div><div class="t m19b x7b h27 y78c ff5 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">local man told Beven to leave the village. When Beven did not leave, </div><div class="t m4a1 x7b h27 y78d ff5 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the man beat him.
