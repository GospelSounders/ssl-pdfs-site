Zachary </div><div class="t m38b x5d h15 y5a4 ff2 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">When Maria Brozozek retired from her work as a tailor in Poland, she </div><div class="t m1f7 x6c h15 y6d8 ff2 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">had a burden to help people in her hometown. Her life took a new </div><div class="t m5a4 x6c h15 y41 ff2 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">direction when she learned about a poor family that was not able to pay the </div><div class="t m5a5 x70 h15 y6d9 ff2 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">rent for their apartment. The owner was about to evict them. Maria asked </div><div class="t m5a6 x70 h15 y6da ff2 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">people in the community to donate used items to be sold and requested the </div><div class="t m263 x70 h15 y6db ff2 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">funds be given to this family so they could remain in their apartment. </div><div class="t m336 x5d h15 y6dc ff2 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Her efforts were a success, and Maria began looking for others she </div><div class="t m5a7 x70 h15 y5aa ff2 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">could help. She developed a plan to designate a special day for what she </div><div class="t m255 x70 h15 y6dd ff2 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">called a Celebration of Joy. Then she organized activities that were open </div><div class="t m5a8 x70 h15 y6de ff2 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to the community. Children prepared a play based on a Bible story; the </div><div class="t m5a9 x70 h15 y6df ff2 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">community was invited to bring used items for an auction following the </div><div class="t m5aa x70 h15 y6e0 ff2 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">play. The funds raised were set aside to help the poor. </div><div class="t mc8 x5d h15 y6e1 ff2 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">On one occasion Maria made arrangements for an art exhibition in </div><div class="t m413 x70 h15 y6e2 ff2 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the city&apos;s castle. One of the city&apos;s artists provided his art collection for </div><div class="t m203 x70 h15 y4f ff2 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sale. On another occasion actors performed for a benefit show. The </div><div class="t m585 x70 h15 y6e3 ff2 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">proceeds of these events were given to a fund to help the poor. </div><div class="t m512 x5f h15 y6e4 ff2 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Maria&apos;s program has done a lot to change the attitude of the city&apos;s </div><div class="t mcd x70 h15 y6e5 ff2 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">residents toward the Adventist Church. The local Catholic priest has </div><div class="t m4f x70 h15 y6e6 ff2 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">given his blessing for his congregation to support the Celebration of </div><div class="t m3fb x70 h15 y6e7 ff2 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Joy. He even invited the Adventists to present a musical concert in his </div><div class="t m47d x70 h15 y57 ff2 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">church to raise funds for the poor. </div><div class="t m4e4 x5f h15 y6e8 ff2 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">When people ask Maria why she does this, she tells them how </div><div class="t m306 x70 h15 y6e9 ff2 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">God&apos;s love changed her life, and she wants to help change others&apos; </div><div class="t m1ef x33 h15 y6ea ff2 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">lives, as well.
