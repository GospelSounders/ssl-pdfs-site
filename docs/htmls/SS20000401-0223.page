H.

For several weeks warriors </div><div class="t m2e7 x50 hc y2f1 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">from two neighboring villages had terrorized the community, burning </div><div class="t m72 x50 hc y2f2 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">houses, slaughtering animals, and destroying crops. Several people </div><div class="t m2e8 x50 hc y2f3 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">had been killed. Laiagam was located between the two warring </div><div class="t mb0 x50 hc y2f4 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tribes. Burning arrows, aimed at the fighting villages, sometimes </div><div class="t m2c7 x50 hc y2f5 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">fell in Laiagam, destroying several homes. The villagers feared for </div><div class="t m2e9 x50 hc y2f6 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">their lives. </div><div class="t mc5 x67 hc y2f7 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">A little Adventist church stood amidst the carnage in Laiagam. </div><div class="t m214 x50 hc y2f8 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The little group of believers met at their beloved church to decide </div><div class="t m12 x50 hc y2f9 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">what to do. They agreed that it would be best if they left the village </div><div class="t m2ea x50 hc y2fa ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">until the fighting ended. As they left their little church, they felt </div><div class="t m2eb x50 hc y2fb ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that this would be the last time they would see it standing. How-</div><div class="t m169 x50 hc y2fc ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ever, one young member decided to stay in the village and watch </div><div class="t m273 x50 hc y2fd ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">over the church. </div><div class="t m2ec x67 hc y2fe ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Shortly after the believers left, Alo, the young man, heard the </div><div class="t m2ed x50 hc y2ff ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sounds of an advancing war party. He could see the glow of their </div><div class="t m296 x7c hc y300 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">lighted torches as they neared the church. He knew that within </div><div class="t m2b5 x50 hc y301 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">minutes the church would be burned to the ground. </div><div class="t m2ee x67 hc y302 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Alo fell to his knees, praying for God&apos;s help. &quot;Lord, help me do </div><div class="t m2ef x7c hc y303 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">what I can to save this church.&quot; Quickly he picked up a piece of </div><div class="t m2f0 x7c hc y304 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">plastic pipe with a funnel attached to one end. The believers used </div><div class="t m2f1 x7c hc y305 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">this homemade trumpet to call worshipers to church. He blew into </div><div class="t m113 x7c hc y306 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the trumpet, which made a loud blast, and again asked God for </div><div class="t m2f2 x7c hc y307 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">help. By now the mob had advanced to a few meters from the </div><div class="t m61 x7c hc y308 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">church. Then they stopped. </div><div class="t m231 x80 hc y309 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The sky seemed to darken as a huge cloud of bees swarmed </div><div class="t m143 x7c hc y30a ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">over the warriors and attacked them. The warriors dropped their </div><div class="t m2f3 x7c hc y30b ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">weapons and fled through the ruins of the village and into the </div><div class="t m64 x7c hc y30c ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">bush, swatting wildly at the stinging bees. </div><div class="t m2f4 x80 hc y30d ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Word of the warring bees that saved the Adventist church </div><div class="t m2f5 x7c hc y30e ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">spread through the highlands of Papua New Guinea.
