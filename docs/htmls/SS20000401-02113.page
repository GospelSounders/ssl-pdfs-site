I went, and there I met the </div><div class="t m289 x79 hc y9ad ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Savior. </div><div class="t m5a6 x1e hc y9ae ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">A few days after my baptism some co-workers and I drove to a </div><div class="t m229 x79 hc y9af ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">funeral some 225 miles from where we live in Tamale [TAH-mah-</div><div class="t m13a x79 hc y9b0 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">leh], Ghana. Before we left, I prayed for our safety. These co-</div><div class="t m1c9 x79 hc y9b1 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">workers had known me as a drinker and laughed at my prayer. </div><div class="t m2bc x1e hc y9b2 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Our trip covered some very rough roads, and I stopped often to </div><div class="t m324 x79 hc y9b3 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">pray. Each time I prayed, my companions mocked me. The road </div><div class="t m3fb x79 hc y677 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">became quite rugged. Suddenly we heard a bang, and the car jerked </div><div class="t m4b1 x79 hc y9b4 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">off the road and into the bush. As I struggled to control the car, it </div><div class="t m735 x1a hc yae ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">veered back onto the road. We stopped and jumped out to inspect the </div><div class="t m289 x79 hc y9b5 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">damage. The right front wheel had come off! The men who had been </div><div class="t m246 x1a hc y9b6 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">laughing minutes before now asked how I had steered the car without </div><div class="t m615 x1a hc y9b7 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the wheel. I told them that God had protected us. </div><div class="t m736 x1e hc y9b8 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I left the others with the car and walked to the nearest town to find </div><div class="t m61e x1a hc y9b9 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">a mechanic. Two different mechanics looked at the car and said that </div><div class="t m2ee x1a hc y9ba ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">without spare parts they could not repair it. And the parts were not </div><div class="t m68 x1a hc y9bb ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">available in that town. </div><div class="t m737 x1e hc y9bc ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I remembered that I had some nylon rope in the trunk. We raised </div><div class="t m6a1 x1a hc y9bd ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the car and pushed the wheel back into place, tying it with the rope. </div><div class="t m1fc x1a hc y304 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">As we got back into the car, I told my companions that I would pray </div><div class="t m4b4 x50 hc y9be ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">for safety. This time they were quiet and did not make fun of me. </div><div class="t m1c9 x1a hc y9bf ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Slowly we started out toward the next town. None of us thought that </div><div class="t m4be x1a hc y9c0 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the rope would hold for long, but I kept driving and praying. </div><div class="t m30d x1e hc y9c1 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">No town along our route had the parts to fix the car, so we </div><div class="t m670 x1a hc y9c2 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">continued on to our destination. We could not find parts there either, </div><div class="t m43a x1a hc y9c3 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">so we started toward home.
