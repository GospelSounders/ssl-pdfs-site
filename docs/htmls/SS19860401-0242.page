As a young man, von Dannecker, sensing that he might not </div><div class="t m1f1 x5d hf y6ea ff3 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">live to old age, determined to produce works in stone that would endure </div><div class="t m15a x5d hf y6eb ff3 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">long after his death. Before long his works of art—statues of Greek and </div><div class="t m54c x5d hf y22c ff3 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Roman gods and goddesses—were being placed in the capital cities of </div><div class="t m218 x5d hf y84 ff3 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Europe and he had an international reputation. </div><div class="t m3ac x62 hf y6ec ff3 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">But von Dannecker was not satisfied.
