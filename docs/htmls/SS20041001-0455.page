But they did not stay there; they left their </div><div class="t me1 x20 h8 y69f ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">mountain homes to scatter religious literature across Europe. When they </div><div class="t m5b6 x20 h8 y6a0 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">found interested persons, they pulled hidden portions of scripture from </div><div class="t m35d x20 h8 y6a1 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">their garments to share with the families they met. </div><div class="t m4f5 x0 h8 y6a2 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Today the Waldensian history is repeating itself in Southeast Asia, </div><div class="t m5b7 x20 h8 y6a3 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">where the church is sending out young people to share the gospel in un-</div><div class="t m5b8 x20 h8 y6a4 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">entered areas within their territory.

They earn </div><div class="t m9e x9b h8 y6a6 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">their living selling literature, and the church provides for their housing. </div><div class="t ma1 x60 h8 y6a7 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Sam and a friend volunteered to serve for a year in this program and </div><div class="t m4f x9b h8 y6a8 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">were assigned to a village that had once had a small Adventist congrega-</div><div class="t m23b x9b h8 y6a9 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tion. Their task was to reopen the Adventist church that had been closed </div><div class="t m1ee x9b h8 y6aa ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">for months. They found the churchyard overgrown with weeds and bushes </div><div class="t m3e0 x9b h8 y6ab ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and spent several days clearing the yard so the church would be visible. </div><div class="t m5ba x60 h8 y6ac ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">They began visiting villagers, but they were met with hostility.

At first, families hesitated to let them help, but with </div><div class="t m98 x9b h8 y6b1 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sickles in hand, the boys began to cut the rice. They joined in the fellow-</div><div class="t m55 x9b h8 y6b2 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ship of working and eating together. They continued working until the </div><div class="t m40a x9c h8 y6b3 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">fields were harvested.
