But they did not stay there; they left their </div><div class="t me1 x21 ha y6a0 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">mountain homes to scatter religious literature across Europe. When they </div><div class="t m5b6 x21 ha y6a1 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">found interested persons, they pulled hidden portions of scripture from </div><div class="t m35d x21 ha y6a2 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">their garments to share with the families they met. </div><div class="t m4f5 x1 ha y6a3 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Today the Waldensian history is repeating itself in Southeast Asia, </div><div class="t m5b7 x21 ha y6a4 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">where the church is sending out young people to share the gospel in un-</div><div class="t m5b8 x21 ha y6a5 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">entered areas within their territory. Trained as literature evangelists and </div><div class="t m547 x21 ha y6a6 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">equipped with the skills of personal evangelism, the youth go out two by </div><div class="t m5b9 x9c ha y22a ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">two to visit communities that have for years resisted the gospel. They earn </div><div class="t m9e x9c ha y6a7 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">their living selling literature, and the church provides for their housing. </div><div class="t ma1 x61 ha y6a8 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Sam and a friend volunteered to serve for a year in this program and </div><div class="t m4f x9c ha y6a9 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">were assigned to a village that had once had a small Adventist congrega-</div><div class="t m23b x9c ha y6aa ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tion. Their task was to reopen the Adventist church that had been closed </div><div class="t m1ee x9c ha y6ab ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">for months. They found the churchyard overgrown with weeds and bushes </div><div class="t m3e0 x9c ha y6ac ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and spent several days clearing the yard so the church would be visible. </div><div class="t m5ba x61 ha y6ad ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">They began visiting villagers, but they were met with hostility. They </div><div class="t m5bb x9c ha y6ae ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">could not find the backslidden members, and others did not welcome </div><div class="t m242 x9c ha y234 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">them.

At first, families hesitated to let them help, but with </div><div class="t m98 x9c ha y6b2 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sickles in hand, the boys began to cut the rice. They joined in the fellow-</div><div class="t m55 x9c ha y6b3 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ship of working and eating together. They continued working until the </div><div class="t m40a x9d ha y6b4 ff3 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">fields were harvested.
