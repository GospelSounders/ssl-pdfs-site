Verses 3-16 suggest, though, that Paul wishes </div><div class="t m714 x3 hb y845 ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to address one instance where some clarification was needed. Some </div><div class="t m3e5 x4d hb y846 ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Christian women in Corinth seem to have felt that they no longer </div><div class="t m7bf x3 hb y847 ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">needed to follow time-honored customs.

Paul&apos;s central concern is for the good name </div><div class="t m7c0 x3 hb y849 ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of Christianity. He does not wish for the fledgling movement to be </div><div class="t m7c1 x4d hb y84a ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;disgraced&quot; by adopting a dress code that others would judge immod-</div><div class="t m1d7 x3 hb y84b ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">est or immoral (see verses 5, 6). </div><div class="t m7c2 x4e h26 y2ab ff3 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">In </div><div class="t m16b x22 hb y2ab ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">what ways may we correctly apply 1 Corinthians 11:2-16? </div><div class="t m3c5 x4e hb y84c ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">In most parts of the world, the wearing of veils is no longer </div><div class="t m209 x3 hb y84d ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">practiced, and this passage may seem irrelevant. However, there are </div><div class="t m5a x3 hb y84e ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">thoughts here that should not escape our notice. Among these is a </div><div class="t m57a x40 hb y2ad ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">principle applicable to any society and time. Christians are to display </div><div class="t m319 x3 hb y84f ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">a modesty and decorum that will allow the good news about Jesus </div><div class="t m544 x40 hb y850 ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">unimpeded access to those who observe their behavior. </div><div class="t m39a x2 hb y2b0 ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Also, note that women </div><div class="t m469 xb2 hb y2b0 ff7 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">are </div><div class="t m14b x8f hb y2b0 ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">praying and prophesying in worship </div><div class="t m7c3 x40 hb y851 ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">(verses 5, 13).

He pauses to </div><div class="t m127 x40 hb y2b5 ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">restate it in a most vivid way: &quot;In the Lord, however, woman is not </div><div class="t m493 x40 hb y2b6 ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">independent of man, nor is man independent of woman.
