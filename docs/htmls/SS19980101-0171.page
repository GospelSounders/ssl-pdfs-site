Verses 3-16 suggest, though, that Paul wishes </div><div class="t m714 x4 hd y846 ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to address one instance where some clarification was needed. Some </div><div class="t m3e5 x4e hd y847 ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Christian women in Corinth seem to have felt that they no longer </div><div class="t m7bf x4 hd y848 ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">needed to follow time-honored customs. They were participating in </div><div class="t mc0 x4 hd y849 ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">public worship unveiled. Paul&apos;s central concern is for the good name </div><div class="t m7c0 x4 hd y84a ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of Christianity. He does not wish for the fledgling movement to be </div><div class="t m7c1 x4e hd y84b ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;disgraced&quot; by adopting a dress code that others would judge immod-</div><div class="t m1d7 x4 hd y84c ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">est or immoral (see verses 5, 6). </div><div class="t m7c2 x4f h29 y2ac ff3 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">In </div><div class="t m16b x23 hd y2ac ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">what ways may we correctly apply 1 Corinthians 11:2-16? </div><div class="t m3c5 x4f hd y84d ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">In most parts of the world, the wearing of veils is no longer </div><div class="t m209 x4 hd y84e ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">practiced, and this passage may seem irrelevant. However, there are </div><div class="t m5a x4 hd y84f ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">thoughts here that should not escape our notice. Among these is a </div><div class="t m57a x41 hd y2ae ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">principle applicable to any society and time. Christians are to display </div><div class="t m319 x4 hd y850 ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">a modesty and decorum that will allow the good news about Jesus </div><div class="t m544 x41 hd y851 ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">unimpeded access to those who observe their behavior. </div><div class="t m39a x3 hd y2b1 ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Also, note that women </div><div class="t m469 xb2 hd y2b1 ff7 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">are </div><div class="t m14b x90 hd y2b1 ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">praying and prophesying in worship </div><div class="t m7c3 x41 hd y852 ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">(verses 5, 13). Paul does not counter their participation as such, but </div><div class="t m204 x41 hd y2b3 ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">only the fact that some are doing so unveiled. </div><div class="t m167 x3 hd y853 ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">In addition, Paul seems uncomfortable moving too far from the </div><div class="t mba x41 hd y2b5 ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">principle of interdependence between men and women. He pauses to </div><div class="t m127 x41 hd y2b6 ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">restate it in a most vivid way: &quot;In the Lord, however, woman is not </div><div class="t m493 x41 hd y2b7 ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">independent of man, nor is man independent of woman. For as woman </div><div class="t m7c4 x41 hd y2b8 ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">came from man, so also man is born of woman. But everything comes </div><div class="t m2db x50 hd y2b9 ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">from God&quot; (1 Cor. 11:11, 12, NIV). As in the Lord&apos;s Supper, where </div><div class="t m7c5 x41 hd yaf ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the rich should not shame the poor, here neither men nor women are to </div><div class="t m45d x50 hd y2ba ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">lay claim to priority and so be &quot;contentious&quot; (verse 16). </div><div class="t mde x3 hd y854 ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;The opinion and conduct of the large body of believers was to be </div><div class="t m7c6 x50 hd y855 ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">respected, and not opposed by a few self-opinionated members of the </div><div class="t m728 x50 hd y856 ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">church at Corinth.
