Jobs </div><div class="t m55b x5a h19 y554 ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">are hard to find, and most work places remain open on Sabbath. It </div><div class="t m26 x5a h19 y555 ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">takes great faith to walk away from a job on Friday afternoon, not </div><div class="t m1b5 x5a h19 y556 ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">knowing if the job will be there on Monday. Youth applying for work </div><div class="t m1f9 x5a h19 y557 ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">often are tempted to hide their religion for fear they will lose the job </div><div class="t m1ce x5a h19 y558 ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">before they even get a chance to prove themselves. </div><div class="t m42f x6c h19 y559 ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">A strong youth organization in the church is crucial to maintain ties </div><div class="t m60 x5a h19 y55a ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">with God during these difficult times. The youth group at one church </div><div class="t m55c x5a h19 y55b ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in Blantyre, Malawi was organized to encourage spiritual growth and </div><div class="t mac x5a h19 y55c ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">outreach. One of its most powerful ministries is its prayer corp. When </div><div class="t m55d x5a h19 y55d ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">a member of the group has a Sabbath or other spiritual problem, the </div><div class="t m368 x5a h19 y55e ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">entire group comes together in prayer. And knowing that friends </div><div class="t m291 x5a h19 y55f ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">understand the difficulties and are praying has helped several young </div><div class="t m1d3 x5a h19 y560 ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">people grow in faith and strength. One of them is Daniel. </div><div class="t m55e x6c h19 y70 ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Daniel had been a faithful member until he went to work at a new </div><div class="t m12a x5a h19 y561 ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">job. Then he began missing church and youth meetings.The prayer </div><div class="t ma7 x5a h19 y562 ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">corp began praying for him. Friends stopped by with encouragement </div><div class="t m67 x5a h19 y73 ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and literature. Daniel appreciated the visits and prayers. He explained </div><div class="t m55f x71 h19 y1b ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that he was negotiating with his employer to have Sabbaths off and </div><div class="t m32e x71 h19 y74 ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">hoped he would soon have a breakthrough. But friends noticed that he </div><div class="t m560 x71 h19 y75 ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">came to church less and less. </div><div class="t m3ec x6c h19 y76 ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Then one Sabbath morning Daniel came to church and reported </div><div class="t m275 x71 h19 y563 ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that his sister was sick and he must go home immediately. He asked </div><div class="t m561 x71 h19 y23 ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">his friends to pray for her. </div><div class="t m562 x6c h19 y564 ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The next Sabbath Daniel was back in church. He told his friends </div><div class="t m563 x71 h19 y79 ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that his sister was seriously ill but had been glad to see him. &quot;She </div><div class="t m564 x71 h19 y565 ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">asked me to pray for her before I left,&quot; he said. He paused a moment, </div><div class="t mcd x71 h19 y28 ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">then continued. &quot;I know she is dying, but she will die in Jesus.&quot; The </div><div class="t m217 x15 h19 y566 ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">peace on his face told of a faith that had grown. </div><div class="t m164 x6c h19 y567 ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Daniel was not in church the following week. But later he told his </div><div class="t m33a x15 h19 y568 ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">friends why. &quot;My sister died Sunday. On Sabbath she told my dad that </div><div class="t m3af x71 h19 y569 ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">she was dying. But she promised him she would not die on Sabbath so </div><div class="t m434 x71 h19 y264 ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that he would not need to make funeral arrangements on that day. God </div><div class="t m26e x15 h19 y2a4 ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">let her live until early Sunday. She died peacefully, knowing that God </div><div class="t m565 x71 h19 y44d ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">accepted her.&quot; </div><div class="t m296 x52 h19 y2a5 ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Daniel learned what was really important. Following his sister&apos;s </div><div class="t m251 x15 h19 y56a ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">death he told his employer that he would no longer work on Sabbaths. </div><div class="t m566 x52 h25 y56b ff3 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Beverly Herbrandson Koester, a former missionary in Malawi, is a </div><div class="t m22b x15 h25 y56c ff3 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">teacher&apos;s aide at Atholton Adventist School in Maryland. </div><div class="t m3b0 x6c h19 y4f1 ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Produced by the General Conference Office of Mission Awareness </div><div class="t m567 x19 h19 y56d ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">E-mail: gomission@gc.adventist.org </div><div class="t m166 x78 h19 y56d ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0"> </div></div><div class="pi" data-data='{"ctm":[1.000000,0.000000,0.000000,1.000000,0.000000,0.000000]}'></div></div>
