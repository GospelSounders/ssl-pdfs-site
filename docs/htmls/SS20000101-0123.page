H. Zachary </div><div class="t m1cb x2a hd y341 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Roberto Azucena of Leyte, Philippines, longed for a personal </div><div class="t m308 x58 hd y342 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">experience with God and a deeper knowledge of the Bible. But the </div><div class="t m309 x58 hd y343 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">church to which he belonged left him feeling uncomfortable and </div><div class="t m30a x58 hd y344 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">unfulfilled. Then two Adventist laymen offered to hold Bible </div><div class="t m2f5 x58 hd y345 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">studies in Roberto&apos;s home. Roberto realized that these two men </div><div class="t m307 x58 hd y346 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">based their faith on the Bible alone. The more he learned about </div><div class="t m30b x58 hd y347 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">God, the more excited he became. When he discovered the Sab-</div><div class="t m30c x58 hd y348 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">bath, he closed his bakery on Sabbaths, in spite of his wife&apos;s </div><div class="t m30d x58 hd y349 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">protests. She wanted nothing to do with this new religion. When </div><div class="t m277 x58 hd y34a ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Roberto decided to be baptized, she threatened to take the children </div><div class="t m6a x58 hd y34b ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and go to live with her parents. </div><div class="t m233 x2a hd y34c ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Roberto needed assurance from God that he was doing the right </div><div class="t m1e0 x58 hd y34d ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">thing to keep the Sabbath and be baptized. He went off by himself </div><div class="t m30e x58 hd y34e ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to pray. For years Roberto had struggled with a strong tobacco </div><div class="t m30f x58 hd y34f ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">habit. He knew that smoking was a sin and had tried to quit </div><div class="t m1dd x58 hd y350 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">several times. But each attempt had ended in failure. He asked </div><div class="t m310 x58 hd y351 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">God for victory over smoking as well as spiritual wisdom to make </div><div class="t m311 x58 hd y55 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the right choices. As he ended his prayer, he threw away his </div><div class="t m27 x58 hd y352 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tobacco. </div><div class="t m312 x33 hd y353 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The next few days were busy ones as he worked in the bakery </div><div class="t m313 x58 hd y17c ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and attended the Bible studies. Six days later Roberto realized that </div><div class="t m314 x58 hd y17d ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">he had not smoked once in almost a week. His craving for tobacco </div><div class="t m1fe x58 hd y17e ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was gone. He knew that his victory over tobacco was an answer to </div><div class="t mff x5c hd y17f ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">prayer. He was convinced that God was guiding him in his spir-</div><div class="t m2eb x5c hd y354 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">itual journey as well. </div><div class="t m315 x33 hd y181 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Roberto has found the close walk with God that he craved. He </div><div class="t m316 x5c hd y355 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">knows that following Christ is the right decision to make, regard-</div><div class="t m317 x5c hd y184 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">less of what others do. As The Quiet Hour evangelistic meetings </div><div class="t m318 x5c hd y185 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">closed, Roberto invited the group of new believers to worship in </div><div class="t m41 x5c hd y186 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the room in his home. He prays that soon his family will join him </div><div class="t mc3 x5c hd y187 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in worshiping God on the Sabbath day. </div><div class="t m319 x4f hd y189 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Update: Word has just been received that Roberto&apos;s wife has </div><div class="t m31a x5c hd y18a ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">changed her mind about his new religion. She and two of their </div><div class="t m31b x5c hd y18b ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">daughters are preparing to be baptized. Continue to pray for this </div><div class="t m31c x5c hd y18c ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">family, who is learning to trust God even when the way is not clear </div><div class="t m29a x5c hd y356 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">before them. </div><div class="t m31d x4f h2f y357 ff6 fs1c fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">J.
