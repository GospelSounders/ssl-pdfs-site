On that train were 350 Adventists, mostly </div><div class="t m24b x26 h8 y937 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">women returning home from a Women&apos;s Ministries meeting. Some 54 </div><div class="t m167 x26 h8 y963 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Adventists, mostly women, were killed. </div><div class="t m6dd x49 h8 y964 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">When the train&apos;s brakes failed, the train rolled backward, reaching </div><div class="t m3f3 x26 h8 y965 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">speeds of 160 miles (240 km) an hour. The two pastors aboard went from </div><div class="t m6de x26 h8 y966 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">car to car comforting and encouraging the women, who prayed and sang </div><div class="t m1eb x26 h8 y967 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">during the 20-minute terror ride before the train crashed. One of these pas-</div><div class="t m41d x84 h8 y968 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tors lost his life; the other lost his arm. </div><div class="t m3ff x49 h8 y969 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Joyce Ager was one of the passengers. Shortly after the crash, Valentina, </div><div class="t m341 x84 h8 y93d ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Joyce&apos;s sister, learned that Joyce had died in the wreck. </div><div class="t m1c5 x49 h8 y96a ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Valentina traveled to the rural crash site to identify her sister&apos;s body. She </div><div class="t m20c x84 h8 y96b ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">searched the large stadium, where most of the bodies had been laid, but </div><div class="t m4da x84 h8 y96c ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">she did not find her sister. Hopeful, she went to the hospital and searched </div><div class="t m6df x84 h8 y96d ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">for Joyce&apos;s name on a list of patients, but she found nothing. Sadly, grimly, </div><div class="t m7e x84 h8 y96e ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">she walked to a smaller makeshift morgue to search for her sister among </div><div class="t m261 x84 h8 y96f ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the dead. </div><div class="t mfb x49 h8 y970 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The bodies were piled on top of one another until space could be made </div><div class="t m120 x84 h8 y971 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">for them in the stadium morgue.

As she walked among the </div><div class="t m6e0 x84 h8 y972 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">bodies, she saw a familiar face. She touched her and found her body </div><div class="t m220 x84 h8 y973 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">warm. She felt for a pulse. Yes, she was still alive! </div><div class="t m3bf x4c h8 y974 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">She shouted and ran to find a doctor. &quot;Come, come! My sister is in the </div><div class="t m5c xf h8 y975 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">morgue, but she&apos;s still alive!&quot; Joyce was carried to the hospital. She was </div><div class="t m168 xf h8 y976 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">unconscious and suffered from multiple fractures, but she was alive. </div><div class="t m409 x4c h8 y977 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Joyce woke up six days later and was transferred to a hospital in the city </div><div class="t m3fa xf h8 y978 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of Dar es Salaam.
