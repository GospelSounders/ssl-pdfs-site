H. Zachary </div><div class="t m6f9 x6 h10 y165 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Zachariah grew up in a Hindu village in eastern India. As a youth </div><div class="t m568 x2b h10 y8cd ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">he turned to crime and became the leader of a gang. He carried a </div><div class="t m40a x2b h10 y8ce ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">weapon wherever he went. </div><div class="t m346 x6 h10 y90e ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Zachariah married a woman who was a Christian. When she real-</div><div class="t m6fa x2b h10 y8cb ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ized how Zechariah hated Christians, she waited until he was asleep to </div><div class="t m6fb x2b h10 y41 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">read her Bible or pray. But one day he caught her praying. &quot;If you are a </div><div class="t m2c5 x2b h10 y62a ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">follower of Jesus, you have no place in my home,&quot; he shouted. </div><div class="t m5cb x6 h10 y872 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Quietly she replied, &quot;While I love Jesus, I will always be a faithful </div><div class="t m5da x2b h10 y629 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">wife to you.&quot; </div><div class="t m514 x6 h10 y90f ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;You will not bring a strange God into my home!&quot; he ordered. </div><div class="t m652 x6 h10 y8cf ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">For two years Zachariah did not talk to his wife. Then one day he </div><div class="t m548 x2b h10 y47 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">abruptly sent her back to her parents.

Let her </div><div class="t m6fc x4b h10 y170 ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">worship her God. She will not disturb you,&quot; they pleaded.

He could not stand the sound of Christian music in his </div><div class="t m2e5 x4b h10 y2de ff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Hindu community.
