He </div><div class="t m4f4 x9a ha y7f2 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">memorized the Lord&apos;s Prayer and often prayed it 100 times in a </div><div class="t m2e9 x9a ha y7f3 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">day, including a request to understand the book of Revelation. </div><div class="t mab x65 ha y7f4 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">He continued reading the Bible when he was drafted into the </div><div class="t m45c x9a ha y7f5 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">army. During this time he learned about baptism and decided to </div><div class="t m1bb x9a ha y7f6 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">be baptized as soon as his military service was over. A fellow </div><div class="t m502 x9a ha y7f7 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">soldier often talked about the Bible, but his friend believed that </div><div class="t m18e x9a ha y1b ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Revelation was a closed book.

Bogdan began learning </div><div class="t mea x21 ha y579 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">English as he studied the brewing business. When he was just 21 </div><div class="t m64c x9a ha y396 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">years old, he was offered a partnership in the brewery and a </div><div class="t m42 x9a ha y397 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">chance to study brewing in Hungary. </div><div class="t m61 x4e ha y7fd ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">One day Bogdan learned that a Canadian evangelist was hold-</div><div class="t m4b4 x21 ha y7fe ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ing Bible lectures in town.
