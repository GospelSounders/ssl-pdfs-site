However, his past and </div><div class="t m5f3 x47 h24 y58a ff2 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">his reputation were barriers, and without the endorsement and support </div><div class="t m1e5 x47 h24 y9c6 ff2 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of Barnabas, his acceptance by the original apostles might have been </div><div class="t m3ff x47 h24 y9c7 ff2 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">difficult.
