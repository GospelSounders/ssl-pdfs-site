Daniel was impressed that anyone could love everyone </div><div class="t m626 xc h24 ya18 ff3 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the same. At the end of the story, the announcer said that ADRA </div><div class="t m3bb xc h24 ya19 ff3 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was sponsored by the Seventh-day Adventist Church. Daniel was </div><div class="t m332 x5c h24 yadb ff3 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">impressed. Here was true Christianity. </div><div class="t m580 x20 h24 yadc ff3 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">One regular radio program featured interviews with leaders of </div><div class="t m518 x5c h24 ya1c ff3 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">various churches. Most leaders attacked one another and accused </div><div class="t m6b7 x5c h24 yadd ff3 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">others of following false doctrines. But one pastor refused to </div><div class="t m43c x5c h24 y6aa ff3 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">attack other denominations. Instead he answered the questions </div><div class="t m6b8 x5c h24 y6ab ff3 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">given him with verses from the Bible. Daniel recognized the </div><div class="t mc8 x5c h24 yade ff3 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">church&apos;s name: Seventh-day Adventist. </div><div class="t m6b9 x15 h24 yadf ff3 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Daniel was not inherently religious; he wasn&apos;t even convinced </div><div class="t m6a6 x5c h24 yae0 ff3 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that there was a God. But if there was, he felt that Adventists must </div><div class="t m6ba x5c h24 yae1 ff3 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">really know Him. After hearing an Adventist scientist defend </div><div class="t md0 x5c h24 yae2 ff3 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">creationism, Daniel decided he wanted to know more about this </div><div class="t m17b x5c h24 yae3 ff3 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">church. </div><div class="t m343 x15 h24 yae4 ff3 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Daniel telephoned the local Adventist church and asked about </div><div class="t m139 x5c h24 yae5 ff3 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">two books that had been offered on the radio. When the pastor </div><div class="t m646 x12 h24 y703 ff3 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">delivered the books, Daniel signed up for the Bible correspon-</div><div class="t m6bb x12 h24 yae6 ff3 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">dence course. The pastor invited him to attend church the next </div><div class="t m2b1 x12 h24 yae7 ff3 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Sabbath, and Daniel agreed. He found that the people loved one </div><div class="t mc5 x12 h24 ya2a ff3 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">another regardless of their race. He was baptized in April 1996. </div><div class="t m397 x15 h24 yae8 ff3 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Daniel was not looking for God, but God found him. He did not </div><div class="t m56a x12 h24 yae9 ff3 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">know that the emptiness in his life was a hunger for God. Before he </div><div class="t m32b x56 h24 ya2d ff3 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">met Adventists, he had not seen anything in </div><div class="t m1e1 x56 h24 y4ae ff3 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">religion that interested him. So what attracted </div><div class="t m16c x56 h24 yaea ff3 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">him to the Adventist Church? </div><div class="t m1a8 x5b h24 yaeb ff3 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;When everyone else was hating,&quot; Daniel </div><div class="t m6bc x56 h24 ya31 ff3 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">said, &quot;ADRA and the Adventists showed </div><div class="t m6bd x56 h24 ya32 ff3 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">love.&quot; Daniel wants to show that love to </div><div class="t m638 x56 h24 yaec ff3 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">others.
