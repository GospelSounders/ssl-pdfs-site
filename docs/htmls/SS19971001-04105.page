He was tired of the hating, especially over reli-</div><div class="t m57e xb h21 yad6 ff3 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">gion. He wasn&apos;t even sure there was a God. </div><div class="t m2ca x1f h21 yad7 ff3 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Then Daniel heard a radio report about ADRA, an organization </div><div class="t m6b6 xb h21 ya14 ff3 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that was helping people on all sides of the war in the former </div><div class="t m64a xb h21 yad8 ff3 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Yugoslavia: the Serbs, the Croats, and the Muslims, without tak-</div><div class="t m4a0 x5c h21 yad9 ff3 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ing sides. Daniel was impressed that anyone could love everyone </div><div class="t m626 xb h21 ya17 ff3 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the same. At the end of the story, the announcer said that ADRA </div><div class="t m3bb xb h21 ya18 ff3 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was sponsored by the Seventh-day Adventist Church. Daniel was </div><div class="t m332 x5c h21 yada ff3 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">impressed. Here was true Christianity. </div><div class="t m580 x1f h21 yadb ff3 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">One regular radio program featured interviews with leaders of </div><div class="t m518 x5c h21 ya1b ff3 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">various churches. Most leaders attacked one another and accused </div><div class="t m6b7 x5c h21 yadc ff3 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">others of following false doctrines. But one pastor refused to </div><div class="t m43c x5c h21 y6a9 ff3 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">attack other denominations. Instead he answered the questions </div><div class="t m6b8 x5c h21 y6aa ff3 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">given him with verses from the Bible. Daniel recognized the </div><div class="t mc8 x5c h21 yadd ff3 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">church&apos;s name: Seventh-day Adventist. </div><div class="t m6b9 x14 h21 yade ff3 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Daniel was not inherently religious; he wasn&apos;t even convinced </div><div class="t m6a6 x5c h21 yadf ff3 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that there was a God. But if there was, he felt that Adventists must </div><div class="t m6ba x5c h21 yae0 ff3 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">really know Him. After hearing an Adventist scientist defend </div><div class="t md0 x5c h21 yae1 ff3 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">creationism, Daniel decided he wanted to know more about this </div><div class="t m17b x5c h21 yae2 ff3 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">church. </div><div class="t m343 x14 h21 yae3 ff3 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Daniel telephoned the local Adventist church and asked about </div><div class="t m139 x5c h21 yae4 ff3 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">two books that had been offered on the radio. When the pastor </div><div class="t m646 x11 h21 y702 ff3 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">delivered the books, Daniel signed up for the Bible correspon-</div><div class="t m6bb x11 h21 yae5 ff3 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">dence course. The pastor invited him to attend church the next </div><div class="t m2b1 x11 h21 yae6 ff3 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Sabbath, and Daniel agreed. He found that the people loved one </div><div class="t mc5 x11 h21 ya29 ff3 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">another regardless of their race. He was baptized in April 1996. </div><div class="t m397 x14 h21 yae7 ff3 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Daniel was not looking for God, but God found him. He did not </div><div class="t m56a x11 h21 yae8 ff3 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">know that the emptiness in his life was a hunger for God. Before he </div><div class="t m32b x56 h21 ya2c ff3 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">met Adventists, he had not seen anything in </div><div class="t m1e1 x56 h21 y4ad ff3 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">religion that interested him. So what attracted </div><div class="t m16c x56 h21 yae9 ff3 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">him to the Adventist Church? </div><div class="t m1a8 x5b h21 yaea ff3 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;When everyone else was hating,&quot; Daniel </div><div class="t m6bc x56 h21 ya30 ff3 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">said, &quot;ADRA and the Adventists showed </div><div class="t m6bd x56 h21 ya31 ff3 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">love.&quot; Daniel wants to show that love to </div><div class="t m638 x56 h21 yaeb ff3 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">others.
