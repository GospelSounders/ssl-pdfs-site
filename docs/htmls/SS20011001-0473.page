But </div><div class="t m60d x9 h12 y704 ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">when Cambodian dictator Pol Pot ordered all intellectuals into forced </div><div class="t ma4 x9 h12 y705 ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">labor, he was not exempt. Thousands of Cambodians died or were </div><div class="t m458 x9 h12 y706 ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">murdered in the months that followed. </div><div class="t m52a x70 h12 y32c ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Tep was assigned to herd cattle. Desperate for food, he risked his </div><div class="t m60e x9 h12 y707 ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">life to secretly slaughter an animal to eat. If the authorities discovered </div><div class="t m1b x9 h12 y708 ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">his deed, he would be killed. </div><div class="t m3ef x70 h12 y709 ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Tep watched in horror as Pol Pot&apos;s soldiers killed entire families, </div><div class="t m5f7 x9 h12 y70a ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">including small children. He saw many of his own family die at the </div><div class="t m60f x9 h12 y70b ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">hands of the government. He knew that sooner or later his time to die </div><div class="t m610 x9 h12 y70c ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">would come. He knew he must find a way to escape into Thailand. </div><div class="t m611 x70 h12 y70d ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">In the dead of night he left his hut and began the long walk to the </div><div class="t m612 x9 h12 y70e ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Thai border and freedom. He knew that soldiers would be looking for </div><div class="t m310 x9 h12 y70f ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">anyone who was trying to escape, and he managed to avoid them. </div><div class="t m58b x9 h12 y710 ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Then, when he was within sight of the border, Tep was caught. </div><div class="t m613 x65 h12 y711 ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">As he took the shovel to begin digging his grave, he realized that in </div><div class="t m614 x9 h12 y712 ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">a few minutes he would be dead. Fear, hopelessness, and discourage-</div><div class="t m615 x9 h12 y713 ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ment grew with every shovelful of earth. Suddenly gun shots rang out. </div><div class="t m616 x9 h12 y714 ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">He expected to die any instant. But no bullet hit him. He looked up to </div><div class="t m2f8 x9 h12 y715 ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">see his captors flee into the jungle, leaving him standing alone beside </div><div class="t m3a8 x9 h12 y716 ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the hole he had dug. He dropped the shovel and made a dash for </div><div class="t m458 x9 h12 y717 ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">freedom. </div><div class="t m617 x65 h12 y718 ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">At last he was free, assigned to a crowded refugee camp in Thai-</div><div class="t m618 x9 h12 y719 ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">land. In that camp Tep learned about Jesus, the Son of God, who loved </div><div class="t m619 x9 h12 y71a ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">humanity so much that He came to this earth to die for lost sinners. </div><div class="t m61a x9 h12 y5b ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">This story was so different from the god he had worshiped.
