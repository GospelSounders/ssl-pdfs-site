Isaiah 65:20 does not mean that sin and </div><div class="t m373 x38 h12 y4b6 ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">death will exist on the new earthAsaiah&apos;s message had a dual application; to </div><div class="t m370 x6 h12 y5c0 ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Israel as a nation, and to the end-time situation when earthly kingdoms have </div><div class="t m3a6 x6 h12 y5c1 ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">been swept away and God&apos;s kingdom established.

Now the secondary application </div><div class="t m533 x38 h12 y19a ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of Isaiah&apos;s prophecy applies. Those features involving sin and death no </div><div class="t m1e4 x6 h12 y4ba ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">longer have relevance.
