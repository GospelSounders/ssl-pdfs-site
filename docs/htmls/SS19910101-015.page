We resist them, we </div><div class="t m91 x25 h7 y78 ff5 fs5 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">resent them, and sometimes we reject them. </div><div class="t m92 xa h7 y79 ff5 fs5 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The stories we will consider during this series are about changes in the lives </div><div class="t m93 x25 h7 y7a ff5 fs5 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of God&apos;s people, and how they related to them. The period between the judges </div><div class="t m94 x25 h7 y7b ff5 fs5 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and the early monarchy covered in the books of Samuel were times of transition </div><div class="t m95 x25 h7 y7c ff5 fs5 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and change, times of political unrest and conflict in Israel and in the surrounding </div><div class="t m96 x25 h7 y7d ff5 fs5 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">nations. The twelve tribes, initially bound together in a sort of loose confederacy, </div><div class="t m82 x25 h7 y7e ff5 fs5 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">had no central government. &quot;In those days there was no king in Israel: everyone </div><div class="t m97 x25 h7 y7f ff5 fs5 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">did what was right in his own eyes&quot; (Judges 21:25, NKJV). With the emergence </div><div class="t m98 x25 h7 y80 ff5 fs5 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of the kingship, adaptation and adjustment did not always take place smoothly. </div><div class="t m99 x25 h7 y81 ff5 fs5 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Serious conflicts had to be resolved, sometimes with tragic consequences. </div><div class="t m9a x24 h7 y82 ff5 fs5 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The narratives in Samuel not only describe one crisis after another in Israel but </div><div class="t m9b x26 h7 y83 ff5 fs5 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">they reveal individual people in crisis, men and women like ourselvesâ€”Hannah, </div><div class="t m9c x25 h7 y84 ff5 fs5 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Eli, Samuel, Saul, and David. Thus the books of Samuel deal with the same kind </div><div class="t m9d x25 h7 y85 ff5 fs5 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of challenges that continue to face us some thirty centuries later: the challenge of </div><div class="t m9e x26 h7 y86 ff5 fs5 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">trusting versus distrusting God; the challenge of divine will versus human inclina-</div><div class="t m9f x26 h7 y87 ff5 fs5 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tion; the challenge of human relationships and sometimes untamed emotions; the </div><div class="t ma0 x25 h7 y88 ff5 fs5 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">challenge of spiritual leadership versus the prostitution of sacred office. </div><div class="t ma1 x27 h7 y89 ff5 fs5 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">First and Second Samuel appear as one book in the ancient Hebrew </div><div class="t ma2 x26 h7 y8a ff5 fs5 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">manuscripts. Samuel could not have authored all of the book bearing his name, </div><div class="t ma3 x26 h7 y8b ff5 fs5 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">because he died before the end of the first book. Yet the entire story stands as the </div><div class="t ma4 x26 h7 y8c ff5 fs5 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;lengthened shadow&quot; of the prophet who established the prophetic office and be-</div><div class="t ma5 x26 h7 y8d ff5 fs5 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">came the spiritual mentor of Israel&apos;s first two kings. </div><div class="t ma6 x27 h7 y8e ff5 fs5 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Finally, the stories in this book reveal much about our God: His patience and </div><div class="t ma7 x26 h7 y8f ff5 fs5 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">mercy in dealing with perverse human nature; His holy and righteous character, </div><div class="t ma8 x26 h7 y90 ff5 fs5 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">which cannot and will not tolerate evil; His insistence on obedience from the heart </div><div class="t ma9 x26 h7 y91 ff5 fs5 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">resulting from a personal relationship with Him. He sought not mere outward or </div><div class="t maa x26 h7 y92 ff5 fs5 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">formal compliance, but a faith that internalizes His law in the heart and </div><div class="t mab x26 h7 y93 ff5 fs5 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">demonstrates it in the life, a faith that acknowledges sin, accepts forgiveness, and </div><div class="t mac x28 h7 y94 ff5 fs5 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">forsakes sin. </div><div class="t mad x27 h7 y95 ff5 fs5 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">It is that kind of faith in the face of change, crisis, and challenge that is so </div><div class="t mae x28 h7 y96 ff5 fs5 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">much needed in the lives of God&apos;s people today. These lessons have been written </div><div class="t maf x28 h7 y97 ff5 fs5 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">for our admonition to help us develop a deeper and stronger faith as we prepare </div><div class="t mb0 x28 h7 y98 ff5 fs5 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">for the final changes, crises, and challenges of this earth&apos;s history. </div><div class="t mb1 x29 h6 y99 ff1 fs5 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">OVERVIEW OF 1 AND 2 SAMUEL </div><div class="t mb2 xa h7 y9a ff5 fs5 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">1 Samuel 1:1-7:17 </div><div class="t m88 x2a h7 y9a ff5 fs5 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">1 Samuel 8:1-31:13 </div><div class="t mb3 x2b h7 y9b ff5 fs5 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">2 Samuel 1:1-24:25 </div><div class="t mb4 x2c h7 y9c ff5 fs5 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The judgeship of </div><div class="t mb5 x5 h7 y9d ff5 fs5 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Samuel </div><div class="t mb6 x2d h7 y9e ff5 fs5 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The reign of </div><div class="t mb7 x2e h7 y9f ff5 fs5 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Saul </div><div class="t mb8 x2f h7 y9c ff5 fs5 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The reign of </div><div class="t mb9 x30 h7 y9d ff5 fs5 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">David </div></div><div class="pi" data-data='{"ctm":[1.000000,0.000000,0.000000,1.000000,0.000000,0.000000]}'></div></div>
