Though the </div><div class="t m3e5 x5 h11 y3d1 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">account is rather brief, a few background thoughts may help </div><div class="t m30e xa4 h11 y3cf ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">put it in perspective. </div><div class="t m3e6 x1f h11 y3d2 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">First of all, how can a woman be caught in adultery without a man </div><div class="t m36a x68 h11 y3d3 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">being caught, as well? Yet, where is the man? Why is only the woman </div><div class="t m3a3 x17 h11 y3d4 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">brought to Jesus? Second, according to Jewish law, it was almost </div><div class="t m183 x68 h11 y3d5 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">impossible to prove that adultery had occurred. Requirements of evi-</div><div class="t m3e7 x17 h11 y3d6 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">dence were so strict that someone would all but have to be set up to be </div><div class="t m3e8 x17 h11 y3d7 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">caught. Proof demanded several witnesses who had no prior knowl-</div><div class="t m3e9 x17 h11 y3d8 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">edge or suspicion that the act would be committed. Jewish law also </div><div class="t m2b1 x17 h11 y3d9 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">stipulated that if anyone even believed someone else was going to </div><div class="t m3b7 x17 h11 y3da ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">break the law, he or she had to do all within his or her power to </div><div class="t m263 x17 h11 y3db ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">prevent the transgression. In other words, catching one in the act was </div><div class="t m3ea x17 h11 y3dc ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">supposed to be completely accidental. There should, ideally, be no </div><div class="t m175 x17 h11 y16 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">plotting to ensnare someone in sin. However, the fact that the man </div><div class="t m3eb x17 h11 y3dd ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">caught with the woman was not accused when she was brought to </div><div class="t m231 x17 h11 y3de ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Jesus indicates entrapment. In fact, Ellen White wrote that the Phari-</div><div class="t m301 x17 h11 y3df ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sees who brought her to Jesus &quot;had themselves led their victim into </div><div class="t m3ec x17 h11 y3e0 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sin, that they might lay a snare for Jesus.&quot;—The </div><div class="t m172 x50 h11 y3e0 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Desires of Ages, </div><div class="t m2c1 x17 h11 y3e1 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">p. 461. </div><div class="t m3ed x18 hf y3e2 ff3 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Entrapped or not, the woman still committed the sin. She had </div><div class="t m3ee x17 hf y3e3 ff3 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">no excuse for her actions. And yet, look at how firmly and un-</div><div class="t m3ef x17 hf y3e4 ff3 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">equivocally Jesus forgave her. Notice His words: &quot;Neither do I </div><div class="t m2b x17 hf y341 ff3 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">condemn thee: go, and sin no more&quot; (John 8:11). Just like that, she </div><div class="t m17d x17 hf y342 ff3 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was forgiven. What did the woman do to deserve such a complete </div><div class="t m352 x17 hf y343 ff3 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and firm pardon for her sins? </div><div class="t m3f0 x18 h11 y19b ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Notice, however, that Christ&apos;s words to her did not end with par-</div><div class="t m3f1 x17 h11 y3e5 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">don.

He did not say to her </div><div class="t m2b7 x3c h11 y3e6 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Don&apos;t do it again, and then </div><div class="t m3f2 xa5 hf y3e6 ff3 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I </div><div class="t m89 x5f h11 y3e7 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">will no longer condemn you.&quot; Instead, </div><div class="t m3bb x17 h11 y3e8 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the pardon came first and then the call to obey. Is this not how the </div><div class="t m3bd x17 h11 y3e9 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Christian life works?
