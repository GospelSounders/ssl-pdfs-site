Andrew managed to get up </div><div class="t m48 x70 h1c y7f4 ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and make his way out of the man&apos;s yard. But instead of going </div><div class="t m425 x33 h1c y96e ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">home, he walked to the next door and continued canvassing until </div><div class="t mcf x33 h1c y48 ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">it was time to quit. </div><div class="t m618 x5f h1c y86 ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">As Andrew stood in the railway station waiting for the train </div><div class="t m443 x33 h1c y87 ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that would take him home, a boy called to him. &quot;Please come to </div><div class="t m14e x33 h1c y96f ff2 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">my home.
