I believe it. That&apos;s all </div><div class="t m634 x9b h1f y3e2 ff3 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">there is to it.&quot; And that would be one way for God to act, if He so </div><div class="t m3f8 x9b h1f y3e3 ff3 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">chose. As Creator and Sustainer of the whole vast Universe, He can do </div><div class="t m4e5 x9b h1f y3e4 ff3 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">as He pleases. </div><div class="t m607 x76 h1f y9b9 ff3 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">But as far as God is concerned, what pleases Him is for us to </div><div class="t m588 x22 h1f y51e ff3 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">validate what He says, to make sure it is true. When John writes, &quot;We </div><div class="t m496 x9b h1f y9a1 ff3 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">accept man&apos;s testimony, but God&apos;s testimony is greater&quot; (1 John 5:9, </div><div class="t m635 x9b h1f y9a2 ff3 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">NIV), he is not saying God has to be believed because of God&apos;s </div><div class="t m506 x22 h1f y9a3 ff3 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">greater power. Rather, &quot;God&apos;s testimony is much stronger&quot; (1 John </div><div class="t m522 x22 h1f y522 ff3 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">5:9, TEV) because it is given to believers by the indwelling Holy </div><div class="t m636 x22 h1f y523 ff3 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Spirit. Hence, His testimony makes sense, it is true, and it is right. </div><div class="t m253 x22 h1f y524 ff3 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">What God has said about the Son is of major importance—and we </div><div class="t m4b2 x22 h1f y9ba ff3 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">think immediately of the voice from heaven at both Jesus&apos; baptism </div><div class="t m1f9 x22 h1f y448 ff3 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and His transfiguration.

The message God wants to get across is not only propositional </div><div class="t m580 x22 h1f y7ff ff3 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">statements or descriptive declarations.
