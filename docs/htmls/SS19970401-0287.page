I believe it. That&apos;s all </div><div class="t m634 x9b h23 y3e3 ff3 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">there is to it.&quot; And that would be one way for God to act, if He so </div><div class="t m3f8 x9b h23 y3e4 ff3 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">chose. As Creator and Sustainer of the whole vast Universe, He can do </div><div class="t m4e5 x9b h23 y3e5 ff3 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">as He pleases. </div><div class="t m607 x76 h23 y9ba ff3 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">But as far as God is concerned, what pleases Him is for us to </div><div class="t m588 x23 h23 y51f ff3 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">validate what He says, to make sure it is true. When John writes, &quot;We </div><div class="t m496 x9b h23 y9a2 ff3 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">accept man&apos;s testimony, but God&apos;s testimony is greater&quot; (1 John 5:9, </div><div class="t m635 x9b h23 y9a3 ff3 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">NIV), he is not saying God has to be believed because of God&apos;s </div><div class="t m506 x23 h23 y9a4 ff3 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">greater power. Rather, &quot;God&apos;s testimony is much stronger&quot; (1 John </div><div class="t m522 x23 h23 y523 ff3 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">5:9, TEV) because it is given to believers by the indwelling Holy </div><div class="t m636 x23 h23 y524 ff3 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Spirit.
