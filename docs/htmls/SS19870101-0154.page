Verse 14. </div><div class="t m44c x26 h1e y722 ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">It is remarkable that Darius should be &quot;sore displeased&quot; with himself rather </div><div class="t m325 x21 h1e y39a ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">than with Daniel. He knew that he had made a mistake. But because Daniel was </div><div class="t m29d x21 h1e y723 ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">his first president the king should have consulted with Daniel before signing the </div><div class="t m35f x21 h1e y724 ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">decree. Because he had been pressured into signing, he had not given the matter </div><div class="t m2b0 x21 h1e y725 ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sufficient thought.

But no one could help him. </div><div class="t m1c9 x9c h1e y72b ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Finally the pressure group came back.

He was the captive of a pressure group, a victim of </div><div class="t m353 x21 h1e y72f ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">national customs and traditions. Reluctantly, but nevertheless effectively, he was </div><div class="t m44f x21 h1e y730 ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">forced to issue the command: Daniel was to be thrown to the lions.
