Verse 14. </div><div class="t m44c x25 h1c y721 ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">It is remarkable that Darius should be &quot;sore displeased&quot; with himself rather </div><div class="t m325 x20 h1c y399 ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">than with Daniel. He knew that he had made a mistake. But because Daniel was </div><div class="t m29d x20 h1c y722 ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">his first president the king should have consulted with Daniel before signing the </div><div class="t m35f x20 h1c y723 ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">decree. Because he had been pressured into signing, he had not given the matter </div><div class="t m2b0 x20 h1c y724 ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sufficient thought. Now he was caught in a bind, trapped within the tradition that </div><div class="t m1b7 x20 h1c y725 ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the laws of the Medes and the Persians could not be changed. </div><div class="t mcb x9d h1c y726 ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Darius did everything he could to come up with some way of protecting Dan-</div><div class="t m297 x20 h1c y727 ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">iel. The Scripture says that &quot;he laboured till the going down of the sun to deliver </div><div class="t m44d x20 h1c y728 ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">him&quot; (Dan. 6:14). The king consulted with several counselors, hoping to find a </div><div class="t m44e x20 h1c y729 ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">loophole in the law. But no one could help him. </div><div class="t m1c9 x9d h1c y72a ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Finally the pressure group came back.

There could be one verdict alone that would fit </div><div class="t m304 x20 h1c y72c ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Daniel&apos;s caseâ€”that was to throw Daniel to the mercy of the lions. The king was </div><div class="t m2e7 x20 h1c y72d ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">trapped by his own words. He was the captive of a pressure group, a victim of </div><div class="t m353 x20 h1c y72e ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">national customs and traditions. Reluctantly, but nevertheless effectively, he was </div><div class="t m44f x20 h1c y72f ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">forced to issue the command: Daniel was to be thrown to the lions.

(Dan. 6:18). What did he do </div><div class="t m211 x20 h1d y733 ff1 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">early the next morning? (Dan. 6:19, 20). </div><div class="t m451 xc8 h9 y734 ff3 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">1</div><div class="t m452 x72 h9 y734 ff3 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">1</div><div class="t m453 x72 h9 y734 ff3 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">1 </div><div class="t m17a x20 h1d y735 ff1 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">III.
