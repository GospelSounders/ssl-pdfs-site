And it was now 80 years since Zerubbabel </div><div class="t m16a x56 h16 y498 ff3 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">had led the initial migration back home. </div><div class="t m49c x72 h16 y499 ff3 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Ezra addressed his appeal to return to Judah to the &quot;chief&quot; </div><div class="t m49d x56 h16 y49a ff3 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">men, the heads of family groups.
