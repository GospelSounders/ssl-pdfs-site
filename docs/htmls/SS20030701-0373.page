H. Zachary </div><div class="t m57d x27 hc y3ab ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">One of Gabriela&apos;s earliest memories was of her grandfather sitting </div><div class="t m57e x41 hc y460 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">beside a wood stove reading his Bible. Although he was a lay leader of </div><div class="t mdf x41 hc y432 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the national church, some things he read in the Bible led him and </div><div class="t m57f x41 hc y767 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Grandmother to join a charismatic church. </div><div class="t m580 x46 hc y768 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Gabriela&apos;s grandmother urged Gabriela to join their church and avoid </div><div class="t m581 x41 hc y769 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">eternal torture in hell. Gabriela was greatly troubled by mental pictures of </div><div class="t m485 x41 hc y76a ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">hell. She wondered how a loving God could permit sinners to suffer </div><div class="t m582 x41 hc y76b ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">forever. Gabriela began to pray for guidance to find the true church. </div><div class="t m583 x46 hc y76c ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">In time Gabriela married, but she continued searching for truth. She </div><div class="t m584 x41 hc y505 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">read literature from many churches regarding what happens after death. </div><div class="t m585 x41 hc y76d ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">One day an Adventist friend invited her to attend religious meetings. To </div><div class="t m586 x41 hc y76e ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">her surprise, Gabriela learned that her mother was attending the meet-</div><div class="t m3f0 x41 hc y76f ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ings. Excitedly, she told Gabriela, &quot;This pastor is teaching the truth </div><div class="t m587 x41 hc y770 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">about the Bible.&quot; Gabriela and her husband attended the entire series. </div><div class="t m588 x46 hc y771 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">When the meetings ended Gabriela and her husband joined a Bible </div><div class="t m8d x41 hc y772 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">study group and soon began attending the Adventist church. Months </div><div class="t mb2 x43 hc y773 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">later they joined the church. </div><div class="t m589 x46 hc y1f ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">But two years later tragedy struck when their baby died. Relatives </div><div class="t m58a x43 hc y774 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">told them, &quot;You lost your child because God is angry with you.&quot; </div><div class="t m58b x43 hc y775 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Confused, Gabriela and her husband stopped attending any church. </div><div class="t m58c x46 hc y776 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">For five years the couple wandered spiritually. Then one day a new </div><div class="t m58d x43 hc y777 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Adventist pastor visited them. Gabriela refused his invitation to return </div><div class="t m6b x43 hc y778 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to the Lord. But her strong rejection was met by kindness, patience, </div><div class="t m2d1 x43 hc y779 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and love. Gabriela still felt the emptiness and hopelessness she had </div><div class="t m58e x43 hc y77a ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">endured for the last five years, but still she refused the pastor&apos;s </div><div class="t m2eb x43 hc y77b ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">invitations. </div><div class="t m58f x45 hc y77c ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Then she fell seriously ill and spent many weeks in the hospital in </div><div class="t m590 x43 hc y5e2 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">great pain. After a difficult surgery, she returned home. Still in great </div><div class="t m4c8 x43 hc y77d ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">pain, Gabriela poured out her heart to God. &quot;Dear Lord, You can let </div><div class="t m324 x43 hc y77e ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">me go to sleep now if You wish, but if You allow me to live, I want to </div><div class="t m93 x43 hc y77f ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">serve You the rest of my life.&quot; God gave her a complete recovery. </div><div class="t m55e x45 hc y780 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Today Gabriela thanks God for the sorrow that has come into her </div><div class="t m591 x43 hc y781 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">life. She is determined that nothing will come between herself and </div><div class="t m592 x43 hc ydc ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">God again. Recently Gabriela, her husband, and her mother were </div><div class="t m593 x43 hc y782 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">rebaptized. &quot;As long as we live we will be faithful to God and help </div><div class="t m594 x43 hc y32 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">others to come to know God,&quot; she said. Gabriela and her husband are </div><div class="t m428 x43 hc y783 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">busy giving Bible studies to people in preparation for evangelistic </div><div class="t m2dc x43 hc y3c7 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">meetings in their Romanian town. </div><div class="t m595 x45 hb y3c9 ff5 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">J.
