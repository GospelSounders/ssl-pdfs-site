In his grief he reached </div><div class="t m1d8 x2c hd y1de ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">out for God. He started reading the Bible and, after a difficult begin-</div><div class="t m1d9 x2d hd y1df ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ning, he found comfort from his reading. As he continued reading the </div><div class="t m1da x2d hd y1e0 ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Bible, he felt a strong need to know God better. </div><div class="t m1db x26 hd y1e1 ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">He saw a notice for a Revelation Seminar and decided to attend. </div><div class="t m1dc x2d hd y1e2 ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">During the seminar he accepted Jesus as his Saviour. Elevantina </div><div class="t m1ab x2d hd y1e3 ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Kazak, a widow, also attended the seminar in search of God. The two </div><div class="t m1d8 x2d hd y1e4 ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">decided to begin their new lives in Christ together. </div><div class="t m1dd x2 hd y1e5 ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The couple wanted to share their new faith with others. They </div><div class="t m11d x2d hd y1e6 ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">attended a lay training seminar for Global Mission Pioneers, con-</div><div class="t m1de x2d hd y1e7 ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ducted by The Quiet Hour. During the training sessions, they com-</div><div class="t m196 x2d hd y1e8 ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">mitted one year of their lives to establish a church in an unentered </div><div class="t m1df x2d hd y1e9 ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">city in the Russian Federation. Their assignment was Neftekamsk, a </div><div class="t m1e0 x2d hd y1ea ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">city in the oil-rich region of the Ural Mountains. The city&apos;s residents </div><div class="t m1e1 x2d hd y1eb ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">were mostly Muslims. </div><div class="t m1e2 x2 hd y1ec ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Viktor and Elevantina arrived in Neftekamsk, eager to work for </div><div class="t m1e3 x2d hd y1ed ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">God. They met strong resistance; few wanted Bible studies; and five </div><div class="t m1e4 x2d hd y1ee ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">times they were asked to move from their living quarters. But they </div><div class="t m1e5 x2d hd y1ef ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">kept praying and visiting. Viktor visited factories, schools, nursing </div><div class="t m1d6 x2d hd y1f0 ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">homes, and kindergartens, offering to present lectures on health and </div><div class="t m1e6 x2d hd y1f1 ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">family life. They continued visitation, and contacted more than 900 </div><div class="t m1e7 x2d hd y1f2 ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">persons. Slowly friendships developed, and God opened the way for </div><div class="t m1e8 x2d hd y1f3 ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Bible studies. What joy was theirs when they saw eight new friends </div><div class="t m1e9 x2d hd y1f4 ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">become brothers and sisters in Jesus Christ! </div><div class="t m1ea x2 hd y1f5 ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">A factory where Viktor had lectured offered to let them use an </div><div class="t m1eb x2d hd y1f6 ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">auditorium for church services.
