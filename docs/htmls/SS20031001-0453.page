All through chapter 1 it was clear that Jonah had </div><div class="t m27f x2a h19 y40c ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">been doing what he was doing despite his belief in God. So, again, for </div><div class="t m4c9 x2a h19 y573 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">him to make so wonderful a proclamation about the Lord and His </div><div class="t m365 x2a h19 y247 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">power means nothing in and of itself. Jonah is one of the best ex-</div><div class="t m414 x2a h19 y4b ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">amples of what is meant by &quot;faith without works&quot; (see James 2:18-</div><div class="t m312 x2a h19 y574 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">20).

Nevertheless, the omission here </div><div class="t m2a2 x13 h19 y579 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">shouldn&apos;t be overlooked. And even if he didn&apos;t confess and even if he </div><div class="t m413 x13 h19 y57a ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">wasn&apos;t truly penitent, it just goes to show that despite these things, the </div><div class="t m17a x13 h19 y57b ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Lord was still willing to try to work with him. </div><div class="t m182 x4a h2a y5d ff4 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Compare Jonah&apos;s prayer to David&apos;s in Psalm 51. </div><div class="t m4cc xa8 h19 y5d ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">What are the </div><div class="t m22e x13 h2a y464 ff4 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">similarities?
