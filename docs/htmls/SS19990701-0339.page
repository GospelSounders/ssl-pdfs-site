When Mr. Costa discovered the Sabbath truth, he asked his </div><div class="t m43a x22 h25 y4b8 ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">pastor why Christians did not keep the Sabbath. His pastor&apos;s answer </div><div class="t m3a8 x22 h25 y4b9 ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">did not satisfy him, so he and his family began studying the Bible &apos; </div><div class="t m43b x22 h25 y4ba ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">together at home.

Others joined the branch Sabbath School, and soon they </div><div class="t m444 xb h25 y4cd ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">needed a larger place to meet. They built a chapel of mud bricks </div><div class="t m1b1 xb h25 y4ce ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and palm branches. </div><div class="t m35c x16 h25 y4cf ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The group continued to grow, and the conference sent a Bible </div><div class="t m347 xb h25 y4d0 ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">worker to help the lay people establish a church there.
