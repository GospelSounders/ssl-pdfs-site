Zhang watched this man and his </div><div class="t m464 x7a he y818 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">wife as they lived out their faith. Their testimonies made a deep </div><div class="t m51 x7a he y289 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">impression on Zhang, and he began longing for a deeper knowl-</div><div class="t m1a3 x7a he y819 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">edge of God. </div><div class="t mc8 x48 he y6d0 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Then the teacher retired and moved away, leaving Zhang feel-</div><div class="t ma5 x7a he y81a ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ing like a sheep without a shepherd. He would not be satisfied </div><div class="t m5ce x7a he y142 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">until knew the deeper truths of God. However, he had no idea </div><div class="t m429 x7a he y2b3 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">where to look for spiritual help. </div><div class="t mfd x48 he y2b4 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Unable to find spiritual truth in his own city, he began travel-</div><div class="t m1f x7a he y81b ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ing to other cities in search of God. His financial situation was not </div><div class="t m2f0 x7a he y2b6 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">good, and he had no money to travel by bus or train, so he rode his </div><div class="t m318 x7a he y45a ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">bicycle long distances, even pedaling over high mountains. Be-</div><div class="t m6b2 x7a he ydd ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">cause he had no money to stay in local inns, he was forced to sleep </div><div class="t m212 x7a he y45c ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in the hay along the roadside. Often he was turned away from </div><div class="t m50f x7a he y2ba ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">hostels because of his appearance. Still he kept going. Through </div><div class="t m3d6 x7a he y3df ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the years he wore out several bicycles traveling in search of </div><div class="t mac x7a he y3e0 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Christ. </div><div class="t m15f x4c he y45d ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">But God was not hiding from Zhang. Eventually Zhang found </div><div class="t m406 x7a he y81c ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the Adventist believers in a large city in western China. There he </div><div class="t m6b3 x54 he y45f ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">learned about the Sabbath and the Lord&apos;s soon return. At last </div><div class="t m6b4 x7a he y35f ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Zhang&apos;s hungry heart was filled. Rejoicing, he returned home </div><div class="t m296 x7a he y81d ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">with the good news. Zhang traveled on business, and wherever he </div><div class="t m2a3 x7a he y28 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">went he sought out Adventist believers. Zhang felt a burden to </div><div class="t m1ed x7a he y4ea ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">share the truths he treasured with others in his home town. </div><div class="t m3ff x4c he y2c ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">He began visiting his family members and sharing the truths he </div><div class="t m69d x54 he y595 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">loved. He met resistance, but he did not give up. Eventually his </div><div class="t ma1 x54 he y4ec ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">wife and her parents agreed to let him convert a storage room in </div><div class="t m3f2 x54 he y3e9 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">their home to a church. People began coming to worship, some </div><div class="t m512 x54 he y30 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">from as far away as 25 miles (40 km) or more. </div><div class="t m28a x4c he y1a3 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Today some 30 people worship with Zhang in his home. The </div><div class="t m6b5 x54 he y596 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">storeroom-turned-church is too small to accommodate further growth, </div><div class="t m3b1 x54 he y4f0 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">so Zhang plans to expand it so others can attend. He remembers </div><div class="t m45 x54 he y81e ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">how long he had to search to find God&apos;s truth, and he is deter-</div><div class="t m6a x54 he y81f ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">mined that others shall find it as well. </div><div class="t m574 x91 h38 y820 ff5 fs17 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Zhao Mu is a Field Director of the Chinese Union. </div><div class="t m39d xb2 he y2c7 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Produced by the Office of Mission </div><div class="t m39d x58 he y821 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Sabbath School-Personal Ministries department of the General Conference </div><div class="t m6b6 x69 he y822 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Email: gomission@gc.adventist.org </div><div class="t m14d xa9 he y822 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0"> </div></div><div class="pi" data-data='{"ctm":[1.000000,0.000000,0.000000,1.000000,0.000000,0.000000]}'></div></div>
