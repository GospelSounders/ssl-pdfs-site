It tells us what we must </div><div class="t m15b x5c h1e yafe ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">do if we desire life. It tells us how we can have wisdom—we are to ask God for </div><div class="t m23a x5c h1e yb60 ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">it. (See James 1:5, 6.) </div><div class="t m5d7 x52 h1e yb61 ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The wise man stresses the importance of wisdom this way: &quot;Wisdom is the </div><div class="t m5d8 x5c h1e yb62 ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">principal thing; therefore get wisdom: and with all thy getting get </div><div class="t m1dc x5c h1e yb63 ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">understanding&quot; (Prov. 4:7). The psalmist says that the &quot;fear of the Lord is the </div><div class="t m2f6 x5c h1e y6c4 ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">beginning of wisdom&quot; (Ps. 111:10). Jesus contrasted the wise and the foolish </div><div class="t m322 x5c h1e y763 ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">virgins in Matthew 25: I -13. He urged that all should watch, because there is one </div><div class="t me3 x5c h1e yb02 ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">thing that no one knows—that is the time of Christ&apos;s coming. </div><div class="t m468 x52 h1e y1c2 ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Those who are wise do not selfishly keep their wisdom to themselves. They </div><div class="t m326 x5c h1e y6dc ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">share it with others. It was God&apos;s plan and purpose that the children of Israel </div><div class="t m377 x5c h1e yb04 ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">would share their laws with others. Then the nations would say: &quot;Surely this </div><div class="t m534 x30 h1e yb05 ff4 fs15 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">great nation is a wise and understanding people&quot; (Deut. 4:6).
