My brother </div><div class="t m2cd x75 hc y6dd ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">had come to meet me and walk home with me, but he was chatting </div><div class="t m1d4 x75 hc y6de ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">with friends, so I started toward home alone. </div><div class="t m535 x37 hc y6df ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The road was dark and deserted.

I pretended I did not </div><div class="t m418 x75 hc y6e1 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">hear him and continued walking.
