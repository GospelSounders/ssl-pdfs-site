Yet the church remains a </div><div class="t maf x2 h1a ya7 ff6 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;mystery&quot; in the biblical sense, defying simple explanations. Since it partakes of the </div><div class="t mb0 x2 h1a ya8 ff6 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">nature of both the human and the divine, it is difficult to dissect it fully and lay bare all </div><div class="t mb1 x2 h1a ya9 ff6 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">its properties. </div><div class="t mb2 x21 h1a yaa ff6 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The lessons this quarter look at the church, including your church and mine, from </div><div class="t mb3 x2 h1a yab ff6 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the viewpoint of the biblical revelation concerning it. We believe without shadow of </div><div class="t mb4 x2 h1a yac ff6 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">doubt that the Bible is the Word of God and that in it we find a true representation of </div><div class="t mb5 x2 h1a yad ff6 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">God&apos;s character and purpose and of His dealings with His people through the </div><div class="t mb6 x2 h1a yae ff6 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">centuries. </div><div class="t mb7 x21 h1a yaf ff6 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The view of the writer of these lessons is that the church can best be understood </div><div class="t mb8 x2 h1a yb0 ff6 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and appreciated in the light of God&apos;s intelligence and love. God wanted a universe </div><div class="t m15 x2 h1a yb1 ff6 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that worshiped Him freely and with understanding. In order to have this He had to </div><div class="t mb9 x2 h1a yb2 ff6 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">allow even for freedom to choose the wrong. This involved a tremendous risk, which </div><div class="t mba x2 h1a yb3 ff6 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was taken. Sin, in terms of misunderstanding God and misusing His entrusted </div><div class="t mbb x2 h1a yb4 ff6 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">properties, did indeed arise. The church is a key part of God&apos;s great plan to vindicate </div><div class="t mbc x2 h1a yb5 ff6 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">His character and to take away sin without detracting from the freedom which God&apos;s </div><div class="t m6d x2 h1a yb6 ff6 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">love requires in the universe. </div><div class="t mbd x21 h1a yb7 ff6 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The church exists wherever we find God&apos;s people, from the beginning of time to the </div><div class="t mbe x2 h1a yb8 ff6 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">present and on into eternity. But in these lessons we are thinking of the church </div><div class="t mbf x2 h1a yb9 ff6 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">primarily in terms of God&apos;s activity after the birth of Jesus. </div><div class="t mc0 x21 h1a yba ff6 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The first lesson emphasizes that God is in control in every situation. Sin, whether in </div><div class="t mc1 x2 h1a ybb ff6 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">heaven or on earth, did not take, Him by surprise. He had a plan to meet it, one </div><div class="t mc2 x2 h1a ybc ff6 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">consistent with His justice and replete with His mercy. The church is part of that plin, </div><div class="t mc3 x2 h1a ybd ff6 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">being the arena and means of His activity. </div><div class="t mc4 x21 h1a ybe ff6 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">We see that the church is based on a firm foundationâ€”Jesus Christ, the Son of the </div><div class="t mc5 x2 h1a ybf ff6 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Living God, recognized and made known by divine revelation. Jesus Christ has built </div><div class="t mc6 x30 h1a yc0 ff6 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the church, and the gates of hell will not prevail against it. The agency for bringing the </div><div class="t mc7 x2 h1a yc1 ff6 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">benefits of the Father and the Son to the New Testament church is the Holy Spirit, as </div><div class="t m7b x30 h1a yc2 ff6 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">promised by Jesus to His disciples. (See John 14 through 17.) </div><div class="t mc8 x21 h1a yc3 ff6 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">How can we recognize the church? What are its characteristics? We will seek </div><div class="t mc9 x30 h1a yc4 ff6 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">answers to these questions in Scripture. We will notice that the church is best </div><div class="t mca x30 h1a yc5 ff6 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">understood in terms of relationships. Yet no purely human relationship can encom-</div><div class="t mcb x30 h1a yc6 ff6 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">pass all that is involved. </div><div class="t mcc x48 h1a yc7 ff6 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">One aspect of the church is the tension between its call to holiness and its </div><div class="t mcd x30 h1a yc8 ff6 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">involvement in sin. To emphasize the one without denying the other is important. Can </div><div class="t mce x30 h1a yc9 ff6 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">we do that? How can a ChriStian be a saint and a sinner at the same time? Do we need </div><div class="t m15 x30 h1a yca ff6 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to redefine our terms? </div><div class="t mcf x48 h1a ycb ff6 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">No area of church life is more debated than that of its structure. Structure and </div><div class="t md0 x30 h1a ycc ff6 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">organization it must have. But what should be its lines of authority? Unfortunately, </div><div class="t md1 x30 h1a ycd ff6 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">history has not shown the church at its best, because emphasis on hierarchy has </div><div class="t md2 x30 h1a yce ff6 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sometimes taken the place of service. Is there a way that we can have order and yet </div><div class="t md3 x30 h1a ycf ff6 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">not reduce the spirit? Can we involve all members of the church, and not merely the </div><div class="t md4 x30 h1a yd0 ff6 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">clergy, in organization? These and other questions reveal the importance of our </div><div class="t md5 x30 h1a yd1 ff6 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">subject. </div><div class="t m1e x48 h1a yd2 ff6 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">May God grant that in the study of these lessons we will discover our role in the </div><div class="t md6 x30 h1a yd3 ff6 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">church and by our faithfulness cooperate more fully with God&apos;s plans. </div></div><div class="pi" data-data='{"ctm":[1.000000,0.000000,0.000000,1.000000,0.000000,0.000000]}'></div></div>
