Perhaps a single note is held over several </div><div class="t m1c6 x13 h1d y115 ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">measures, or a series of quick runs is followed by rests that seem to </div><div class="t m1be x13 h1d y116 ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">make no sense.

One day Mr. Costa discovered that the Sabbath, which he </div><div class="t m39b x13 h1d y389 ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">had thought was a commandment given to the Jews, was in fact a gift </div><div class="t m39c x13 h1d y38a ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to all humanity. He asked his pastor why Christians do not observe </div><div class="t m39d x13 h1d y3f8 ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">God&apos;s Sabbath, but the pastor brushed his question aside. </div><div class="t m39e x24 h1d y3f9 ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Disappointed in his pastor&apos;s response, Costa quit attending church, </div><div class="t m37d x13 h1d y3fa ff5 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">but he continued studying the Bible at home with his family.
