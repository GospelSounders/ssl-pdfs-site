She </div><div class="t m106 x11 h11 y60b ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">would help reopen a mission hospital and train midwives and health </div><div class="t m217 x11 h11 y468 ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">care workers. </div><div class="t m5a0 x46 h11 y263 ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">A pastor and his wife also had been assigned to serve in the area, </div><div class="t m5a1 x11 h11 y469 ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">where most of the people are Adventists. The only pastor serving the </div><div class="t m5a2 x11 h11 y46a ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">area was old and lacked transportation to visit all the churches. </div><div class="t m2e8 x46 h11 y60d ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Tania surveyed the mission. Except for the church, the mission lay in </div><div class="t m1b x47 h11 y46c ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ruins. One home had been made liveable for the missionaries. </div><div class="t m5a3 x46 h11 y60f ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">People had heard that a nurse was coming and were waiting for </div><div class="t m5a4 x11 h11 y46e ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">treatment. Tania began treating malaria, tropical sores, and diarrhea </div><div class="t m5a5 x47 h11 y733 ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">with the few supplies she had. There was so much to do, and every night </div><div class="t m5a6 x11 h11 y470 ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">she fell into bed exhausted but satisfied. </div><div class="t m220 x46 h11 y471 ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">One night she awoke to the sound of breaking glass. Someone was </div><div class="t m5a7 x47 h11 y472 ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">breaking their windows! The pastor took his flashlight and went to the </div><div class="t m583 x47 h11 y473 ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">door to see what he could do. &quot;We want you!&quot; some men shouted. </div><div class="t m5a8 x47 h11 y734 ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Instinctively Tania knew that this was not a medical emergency. Fright-</div><div class="t m5a9 x47 h11 y614 ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ened, she stumbled in the dark toward the pastor&apos;s room. </div><div class="t m5aa x46 h11 y474 ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The mob beat down the door, and when the pastor tried to calm the </div><div class="t m5ab x47 h11 y735 ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">angry men, they began beating him. The women cowered in the bed-</div><div class="t m79 x47 h11 y736 ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">room praying and crying as the pastor suffered blow after blow. Some </div><div class="t m5ac x47 h11 y616 ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">men ran into the bedroom and began hitting Tania and the pastor&apos;s wife. </div><div class="t m5ad x47 h11 y478 ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Would they kill themâ€”or worse? Tania could do nothing but pray. The </div><div class="t m12a x47 h11 y5dc ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">mob tore up the rooms looking for valuables. One man accused the </div><div class="t m5ae x47 h11 y5dd ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">missionaries of being government spies. </div><div class="t m5af x46 h11 y737 ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">When the invaders finally left, Tania and the pastor&apos;s wife lay still, </div><div class="t m157 x47 h11 y479 ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">listening for sounds. They could hear the pastor&apos;s groans as he stumbled </div><div class="t m5b0 x47 h11 y61b ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">toward the bedroom. He had been severely beaten, but in the darkness </div><div class="t m5b1 x47 h11 y47b ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">there was little they could do. Together they waited for the dawn. </div><div class="t m68 x46 h11 y61d ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">As dawn lighted the sky, Tania treated the pastor&apos;s injuries. He </div><div class="t m4cd x47 h11 y47d ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">needed a doctor, but the mission was 13 hours by car from the nearest </div><div class="t m2c5 x47 h11 y738 ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">city. They had no way to contact the outside world, and the pastor </div><div class="t m5b2 x47 h11 y47f ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">needed help. But Tania did not want to leave. She had been there only 10 </div><div class="t m12f x47 h11 y480 ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">days, but she had seen the immense needs of the people. &quot;There&apos;s so </div><div class="t m44 x47 h11 y620 ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">much to do here,&quot; she said. &quot;We can&apos;t quit!&quot; </div><div class="t m4d0 x49 h11 ybf ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The missionaries heard someone outside. It was the old pastor. He </div><div class="t m5b3 x4a h11 y739 ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">had heard the mob&apos;s shouts and had tried to come and help them, but the </div><div class="t m5b4 x4a h11 y481 ff4 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">mob would not let him through.
