Notice that Paul stresses the element of </div><div class="t m1dd x13 hb y7d8 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">love, saying that we must be &quot;rooted and grounded&quot; in it. These words </div><div class="t m765 x13 hb y648 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">imply stability, firmness, and permanency in the foundation of love. </div><div class="t m5d0 x13 hb y82b ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Our faith means nothing if it is not rooted in love for God and love for </div><div class="t mcc x13 hb y46f ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">others (Matt. 22:37-39; 1 Corinthians 13). This love does not come in a </div><div class="t m3d8 x13 hb y82d ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">vacuum. On the contrary, it comes because we get a glimpse of God&apos;s </div><div class="t m4f x4a hb y82e ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">love for us (a love that &quot;passeth understanding&quot;) as manifested through </div><div class="t m6a4 x4a hb y82f ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Jesus. As a result, our lives are changed, our hearts are changed, and we </div><div class="t m766 x4a hb y830 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">become new people with new thoughts, new desires, and new goals.
