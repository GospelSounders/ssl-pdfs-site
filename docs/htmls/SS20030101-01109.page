Not </div><div class="t m1db x2f h9 ya7e ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">only is the law there, but according to the texts for today, Christ </div><div class="t m129 x5d h9 ye7 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">is, as well, which, of course, makes good sense, for Christ and His law </div><div class="t m2cf x5d h9 ya12 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">are so closely connected.

Notice that Paul stresses the element of </div><div class="t m1dd x12 h9 y7d7 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">love, saying that we must be &quot;rooted and grounded&quot; in it. These words </div><div class="t m765 x12 h9 y647 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">imply stability, firmness, and permanency in the foundation of love. </div><div class="t m5d0 x12 h9 y82a ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Our faith means nothing if it is not rooted in love for God and love for </div><div class="t mcc x12 h9 y46e ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">others (Matt. 22:37-39; 1 Corinthians 13). This love does not come in a </div><div class="t m3d8 x12 h9 y82c ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">vacuum. On the contrary, it comes because we get a glimpse of God&apos;s </div><div class="t m4f x49 h9 y82d ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">love for us (a love that &quot;passeth understanding&quot;) as manifested through </div><div class="t m6a4 x49 h9 y82e ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Jesus. As a result, our lives are changed, our hearts are changed, and we </div><div class="t m766 x49 h9 y82f ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">become new people with new thoughts, new desires, and new goals. It is </div><div class="t m124 x49 h9 y830 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">our reaction to God&apos;s love for us that changes our hearts and instills love </div><div class="t m177 x49 h9 y831 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">for others. Perhaps this is what Paul means, at least partially, when he </div><div class="t m37c x49 h9 y75f ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">talks about us being filled with &quot;the fullness of God.&quot; </div><div class="t m767 x11 hf y832 ff7 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Read 1 John 4:16.
