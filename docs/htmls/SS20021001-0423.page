He believed that Islam </div><div class="t m190 x25 h20 y2ea ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was the one true religion and that only a traitor would leave that faith. </div><div class="t m2e1 x25 h20 y2eb ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Abdel spoke the Berber language, as do 11 million people in North </div><div class="t m306 x25 h20 y2ec ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Africa. </div><div class="t m307 x39 h20 y2ed ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">When he was a teenager, Abdel met a man working with ADRA. </div><div class="t mc1 x25 h20 y2ee ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">He came to trust and admire him. The ADRA worker told Abdel about </div><div class="t m15c x25 h20 y2ef ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">a radio broadcast called </div><div class="t m308 x53 h20 y2f0 ff8 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Voice of Hope. </div><div class="t m309 x8d h20 y2f0 ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Although the program was not </div><div class="t m304 x25 h20 y2f1 ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">broadcast in Abdel&apos;s mother language, Abdel listened to the broadcasts </div><div class="t m2a4 x25 h20 y2f2 ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and enjoyed what he heard. But he did not tell his parents. He was </div><div class="t m30a x25 h20 y2f3 ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">fascinated by the stories from the Bible and enjoyed the songs about </div><div class="t m30b x25 h20 y2f4 ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Jesus. After listening for several months, Abdel asked his ADRA </div><div class="t m30c x25 h20 y2f5 ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">friend for a Bible and Bible lessons. He hid the Bible and lessons in his </div><div class="t m30d x25 h20 y2f6 ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">room, so no one would know he was studying Christian books. </div><div class="t mc2 x3c h20 y2f7 ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">In Abdel&apos;s culture the women clean the men&apos;s rooms. One day when </div><div class="t m288 x35 h20 y2f8 ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">his sister was picking up his things, she discovered the hidden Bible </div><div class="t ma8 x25 h20 y2f9 ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and lessons. Fascinated, she began studying them for herself, but she </div><div class="t m30e x25 h20 yc7 ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">did not tell Abdel or their parents. </div><div class="t m1fb x3c h20 y2fa ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">One day she found an announcement in Abdel&apos;s papers telling </div><div class="t m30f x35 h20 y2fb ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">about a meeting of Adventist Christians in their country. She had </div><div class="t m2d6 x35 h20 y2fc ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">overheard Abdel talking about making a trip, and she realized he was </div><div class="t m30e x35 h20 y2fd ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">going to this meeting. She decided to attend the meeting too. </div><div class="t m16 x3c h20 y2fe ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">When Abdel arrived at the meeting, he was shocked to see his sister. </div><div class="t m310 x35 h20 y2ff ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">She told him how she had learned about Jesus and that she wanted to </div><div class="t mc0 x35 h20 y300 ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">follow Christ. Abdel promised to keep her secret from their family. </div><div class="t m311 x3c h20 y301 ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Abdel&apos;s sister met a Christian young man, and eventually the two </div><div class="t m219 x35 h20 y302 ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">were married. They moved to Europe, where they enrolled in an </div><div class="t m312 x35 h20 y303 ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Adventist school. Abdel also left his homeland to study in Europe, but </div><div class="t m1ce x35 h20 y304 ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">he could not get a visa to the same country his sister was living in, so he </div><div class="t m99 x35 h20 y305 ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">began studying in a small Adventist seminary. His parents still do not </div><div class="t m29f x35 h20 y306 ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">know that their children are Christians. If they did, they would be </div><div class="t m1c7 x35 h20 y307 ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">required to disown them. </div><div class="t m205 x38 h20 y308 ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Abdel wants to become a pastor and create radio programs in his </div><div class="t m95 x35 h20 y309 ff5 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">own language.
