God’s word is </div><div class="t m0 x45 h36 y257 ff12 fs3 fc3 sc0 ls2 ws6">effective in determining the state of the Creation.  </div><div class="t m0 x58 h36 y258 ff12 fs3 fc3 sc0 ls18 ws27">Second, the light was “good.” We may wonder why the text says </div><div class="t m0 x45 h36 y259 ff12 fs3 fc3 sc0 ls18 ws30">that God “saw” the light; is there any doubt that God sees every<span class="ls2 ws5">-</span></div><div class="t m0 x45 h36 y25a ff12 fs3 fc3 sc0 ls18 wsa4">thing? The point is that the light made by God was good, even in </div><div class="t m0 x45 h36 y25b ff12 fs3 fc3 sc0 ls18 wsa4">God’s eyes. We know that the light is good because God Himself </div><div class="t m0 x45 h36 y25c ff12 fs3 fc3 sc0 ls18 ws6">evaluated it as such.</div><div class="t m0 x58 h36 y25d ff12 fs3 fc3 sc0 ls2 wscc">Another point is that God divided the light from the darkness.
