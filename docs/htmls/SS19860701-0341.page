Not long before Peter had declared, </div><div class="t m23a x1 h16 y691 ff5 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Though all men shall be offended because of thee, yet will I never be </div><div class="t m3f7 x1 h16 y454 ff5 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">offended&quot; (Matt. 26:33).

Again Peter&apos;s re-</div><div class="t m237 x33 h16 y695 ff5 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sponse was genuine and free of pride.
