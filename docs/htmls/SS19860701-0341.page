Not long before Peter had declared, </div><div class="t m23a x0 h13 y690 ff5 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Though all men shall be offended because of thee, yet will I never be </div><div class="t m3f7 x0 h13 y453 ff5 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">offended&quot; (Matt. 26:33).

Again Peter&apos;s re-</div><div class="t m237 x32 h13 y694 ff5 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sponse was genuine and free of pride. Christ&apos;s commission to Peter then </div><div class="t ma1 x32 h13 y695 ff5 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">became, &quot;Feed my sheep&quot; (verse 16). </div><div class="t m2a1 x45 h13 y556 ff5 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">One last time Jesus put His question to Peter.

Although Peter had de-</div><div class="t m267 x32 h13 y69b ff5 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">nied his Lord, the love which Jesus bore him never faltered.
