I was searching for something, but I did not know what. </div><div class="t m377 x1c hd y612 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Some of my friends invited me to become a member of their cult, </div><div class="t m4f4 x1c hd y613 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">but I hesitated. Eventually, they convinced me to quit school and </div><div class="t m100 x1c hd y614 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">join them. They said the Bible did not prohibit smoking, drinking, </div><div class="t m232 x1c hd y615 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">drugs, adultery, or other activities </div><div class="t m3b9 x54 h15 y615 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I </div><div class="t m131 x3f hd y615 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">had thought of as sinful. </div><div class="t m15f x1d hd y616 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I started taking drugs, and soon I graduated to selling drugs. But </div><div class="t m117 x1c hd y617 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">when I learned that the police knew about my activities, I became </div><div class="t m47f x1c hd y618 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">worried. I did not want to spend my life in prison! </div><div class="t m2dc x1d hd y619 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I grew restless and could not sleep. I began reading the Bible, </div><div class="t m2f4 x1c hd y61a ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">although my mind was foggy from drugs and alcohol. I realized </div><div class="t m2d0 x1c hd y61b ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that my life was out of control, but I could not help myself. My </div><div class="t m37 x1c hd y61c ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">soul cried out for hope and salvation. The religion that had prom-</div><div class="t m3c5 x1c hd y61d ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ised a good life was choking me. Instead of happiness it brought </div><div class="t m52f x1c hd y61e ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sorrow, and instead of life it brought death. I cried out to God, and </div><div class="t m96 x1c hd y61f ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">He reached down and pulled me out of the pit of sin. </div><div class="t m4e8 x1d hd y620 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Two Adventist friends invited me to a nature program at their </div><div class="t m1dc x1c hd y621 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">church. I was inspired by the devotional message </div><div class="t m530 x37 h15 y622 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I </div><div class="t m531 x88 hd y623 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">heard. I yearned </div><div class="t m19b x1c hd y624 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to have what these Christians had—real happiness, true freedom, </div><div class="t m3db x1c hd y625 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and purity. As I prayed, I felt God&apos;s power pumping new life into </div><div class="t m532 x1c hd y626 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">me. </div><div class="t m1ad x1d hd y627 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">However, the devil was not willing to let me go. He tried to </div><div class="t m36d xc hd y628 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">convince me that God could not love me. But God assured me that </div><div class="t m2b8 x1c hd y629 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">He loves me and I am His child. </div><div class="t m533 x1d hd y62a ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I spent much time on my knees begging God to save me from </div><div class="t m15b x1c hd y62b ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the sins that I had let bind me. Soon I had the assurance that God </div><div class="t m34 x1c hd y62c ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">accepted me and would abide with me. I stopped associating with </div><div class="t m256 xc hd y62d ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">my former friends and spent all my time with my new Adventist </div><div class="t m91 x1c hd y62e ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">brothers and sisters. </div><div class="t m534 x2c hd y62f ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I moved back into my parents&apos; home. They were not sure they </div><div class="t m535 xc hd y630 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">wanted me back. But the changes they saw in my life convinced </div><div class="t mcd xc hd y631 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">them that I had met Jesus. </div><div class="t m33 x1d hd y632 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Today I am truly happy. I have returned to school; my life has </div><div class="t m2ed xc hd y633 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">found direction and purpose.
