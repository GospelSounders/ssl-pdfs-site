What made this task even worse was that Amos was called to do </div><div class="t m146 x48 h10 y12f ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">it at a time of national wealth and prosperity, when no one wants to </div><div class="t m147 x48 h10 y130 ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">hear the low drones of pessimistic doomsayers. Yet this is exactly </div><div class="t ma0 x32 h10 y131 ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">what Amos, from &quot;among the herdmen of Tekoa&quot; (Amos 1:1), did. </div><div class="t m148 x48 h10 y132 ff5 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Who was this lowly, uneducated country boy who dared shake his </div><div class="t m149 x32 h10 y133 ff5 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">finger at the establishment? </div><div class="t m14a x4f hf y134 ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Read Amos 1:1. Notice what is missing. There is no attempt by </div><div class="t m14b x48 hf y135 ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Amos to justify his calling, his mission, his work. It begins, </div><div class="t m14c x48 hf y136 ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">simply, with only this introduction: &quot;The words of Amos ...&quot; He </div><div class="t m14d x48 hf y137 ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">then utters his warnings and admonitions. Perhaps the key to </div><div class="t m14e x48 hf y44 ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">understanding this attitude is found in the following verses (Amos </div><div class="t m14f x48 hf y138 ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">1:3, 6, 9, 11, 13; 2:1, 6). What do they say about the source of his </div><div class="t m150 x48 hf y139 ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">authority and power? </div><div class="t m151 x4f h10 y13a ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The book that bears his name gives very little information about </div><div class="t m152 x48 h10 y13b ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Amos. In the seventh chapter, Amos basically repeats what he said in </div><div class="t m25 x48 h10 y13c ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the first verse of the first chapter, which is that he was a herdsman </div><div class="t m153 x48 h10 y13d ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and a &quot;gatherer of sycomore fruit&quot; (Amos 7:14). Nevertheless, he </div><div class="t m154 x48 h10 y13e ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">here justifies his ministry, claiming that the Lord had called him to </div><div class="t m155 x48 h10 y13f ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;prophesy unto my people Israel&quot; (vs. 15). What more did he need? </div><div class="t m111 x48 h10 y140 ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">God called him—that was all that mattered. </div><div class="t md9 x2b h10 y141 ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Amos said: &quot;&apos;I am no prophet, nor a prophet&apos;s son&quot;&apos; (vs. 14, RSV). </div><div class="t m156 x48 h10 y142 ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The &quot;sons of the prophets&quot; refers to those educated in the schools of </div><div class="t m157 x48 h10 y143 ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the prophets started by Samuel. In other words, he wasn&apos;t a &quot;profes-</div><div class="t m70 x48 h10 y144 ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sional,&quot; yet that didn&apos;t stop him. </div><div class="t m158 x2b h10 y145 ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Compare Amos with the apostle Paul. Read the opening lines of </div><div class="t m155 x48 h10 y146 ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">some of Paul&apos;s epistles. In most cases, he establishes his credentials </div><div class="t m159 x48 h10 y147 ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in the same way Amos did. (See Rom. 1:1, 2; Gal. 1:1; 1 Cor. 1:1.) At </div><div class="t m15a x48 h10 y148 ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the same time, look at the contrast between Paul and Amos, at least in </div><div class="t md7 x6e h10 y149 ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">regard to their backgrounds. </div><div class="t m6f x6f hf y14a ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The call of Amos does teach that one doesn&apos;t need to be a </div><div class="t m11b x8 hf y14b ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">recognized &quot;professional&quot; to have a crucial role in ministry. At </div><div class="t m11b x8 hf y31 ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the same time, however, Amos doesn&apos;t teach that everyone who </div><div class="t m7c x8 hf y14c ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">claims to be called by God is, in fact, called by God.
