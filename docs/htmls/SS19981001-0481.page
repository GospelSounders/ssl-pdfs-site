His miraculous </div><div class="t m623 x61 he y76a ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">escape from death forced him to wonder if God was trying to tell </div><div class="t m1c3 x61 he y76b ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">him something. But the devil was not willing to let go and tried to </div><div class="t m2cb x61 he y76c ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">frighten Josef into giving up his search for God. But the devil&apos;s </div><div class="t m1b7 x61 he y76d ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">plan only drove Josef to seek God more intensely. </div><div class="t m624 x3f he y76e ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Josef spent his free time reading his Bible and studying the </div><div class="t m27b x61 he y145 ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Bible correspondence course he had sent for. One day he found the </div><div class="t m625 x61 he y651 ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">passage in Exodus that commanded God&apos;s people to remember the </div><div class="t m167 x61 he y76f ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Sabbath day. He wondered, </div><div class="t m2e xc he y76f ff9 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">How is it that the Bible commands </div><div class="t m35e x61 he y770 ff9 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">God&apos;s people to keep the Sabbath, but Christians worship on </div><div class="t m385 x61 he y771 ff9 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Sunday? </div><div class="t m127 x3f he y772 ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">When he found no one who had an answer, he asked God to </div><div class="t m2d2 x61 he y773 ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">send him the answer. A few days later he received the next lesson </div><div class="t m4af x61 he y774 ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in the Bible study course. It was on the Sabbath. He recognized </div><div class="t m30 x61 he y775 ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">this lesson was God&apos;s answer to his prayer, and he decided he </div><div class="t mf9 x61 he y776 ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">would keep the Sabbath holyâ€”even if he had to keep it alone. </div><div class="t m4f2 x3f he y6b0 ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Then he received the Bible lesson that spoke of Jesus&apos; soon </div><div class="t m269 x61 he y6b1 ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">return. This was another surprise for him. Josef wanted to talk to </div><div class="t m2ad x61 he y41a ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">someone who could help him understand these new teachings. He </div><div class="t m23c x61 he y41b ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">wrote a letter to the Bible correspondence school, asking if they </div><div class="t m23e x16 he y777 ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">knew someone in his area who could answer his questions. </div><div class="t m625 x3f he y778 ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">A pastor telephoned Josef and arranged to meet him at the train </div><div class="t m626 x16 he y779 ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">station. Josef waited at the appointed spot, but no one came. </div><div class="t m29a x16 he y77a ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Finally a man walked up to him and asked, &quot;Are you Josef?&quot; Josef </div><div class="t m627 x16 he y77b ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">nodded. The pastor explained that Josef did not look the way the </div><div class="t m253 x16 he y77c ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">pastor had pictured him in his mind, so he did not recognize the </div><div class="t m370 x16 he y77d ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">young man.

The pastor </div><div class="t m463 x16 he y77f ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">arranged to begin personal Bible studies that would answer Josef s </div><div class="t m5bb x16 he y780 ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">questions about God. Josef was an eager student and the pastor a </div><div class="t m178 x16 he y781 ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">patient teacher. Josef thanks God for saving him from death while </div><div class="t m467 x16 he y782 ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">riding his motorcycle; but even more, for saving him from eternal </div><div class="t m4e1 x16 he y783 ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">death at the hands of Satan and giving him a new life, new hope, </div><div class="t m416 x16 he y784 ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and the promise of an eternity with Christ. </div><div class="t m109 x2f h2f y785 ff6 fs1e fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Mihalet Dogaborh is a pastor in Hungary. </div><div class="t mdf x7f h3b y785 ff7 fs1e fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Josef now lives in Goreab, </div><div class="t m4ec x35 h2f y4fc ff6 fs1e fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">a small town in Hungary. </div><div class="t m628 x2f he y786 ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Produced by the General Conference Office of Mission Awareness </div><div class="t m215 x3d he y787 ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">E-mail: gomission@compuserve.com </div><div class="t m12f x8a he y787 ff7 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0"> </div><div class="t m4ef xc2 h3b y788 ff7 fs1e fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">79 </div></div><div class="pi" data-data='{"ctm":[1.000000,0.000000,0.000000,1.000000,0.000000,0.000000]}'></div></div>
