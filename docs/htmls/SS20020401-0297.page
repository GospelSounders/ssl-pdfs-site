When his wife warned </div><div class="t m75a x4a h15 y3a9 ff2 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">him that gambling would eventually lead them into poverty, </div><div class="t m155 x4a h15 y7c6 ff2 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">John dismissed her comments, saying that he was born lucky. </div><div class="t m73a x5 h15 y12c ff2 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Then one day John began losing games. In order to win back </div><div class="t m672 x4a h15 y99e ff2 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">his money, he took bigger chances, risking more money. In one </div><div class="t m1d7 x4a h15 y12e ff2 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">game he lost more than he had made in all of his earlier gambling </div><div class="t m186 x4a h15 y99f ff2 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">wins. John went home broke. But instead of quitting his gam-</div><div class="t m75b x4a h15 y130 ff2 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">bling, he began selling his possessions in order to continue </div><div class="t m71c x4a h15 y131 ff2 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">playing, confident that with one more game he could win back </div><div class="t m17d x4a h15 y3ad ff2 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">all that he had lost. </div><div class="t m75c x5 h15 y132 ff2 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">But John continued to lose, and soon all the money he had </div><div class="t m703 x4a h15 y133 ff2 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">obtained from selling his possessions was gone. He sold more </div><div class="t m18b x49 h15 y134 ff2 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and gambled more and lost more.

From this program she had </div><div class="t m2a9 x49 h15 y13d ff2 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">learned new things about the Bible.

He found that he enjoyed the gospel music, </div><div class="t m1ec x49 h15 y142 ff2 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and for the first time he really understood the story of Jesus. He </div><div class="t m1fb x6d h15 y143 ff2 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">could feel a change come over him. </div><div class="t m75f x23 h15 y9a6 ff2 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">After ten days of listening to Adventist World Radio pro-</div><div class="t m760 x6d h15 y145 ff2 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">grams with his wife, John found a new passion in his life.
