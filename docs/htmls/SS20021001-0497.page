One night I was awakened by loud snoring. </div><div class="t m94 x35 h1c y99d ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">At first </div><div class="t m74d x2e h14 y99e ff6 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I </div><div class="t m380 xc0 h1c y99e ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">thought that it was my partner, but the sound seemed to </div><div class="t m9 x35 h1c y99f ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">be coming from a different location. The snoring was so loud that I </div><div class="t m53f x35 h1c y9a0 ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">found it difficult to go back to sleep. </div><div class="t m287 x3c h1c y9a1 ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The next morning I forgot about the midnight noise, but that </div><div class="t m6de x35 h1c y9a2 ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">night the snoring awoke me again.

Early the next morning, I looked around but saw </div><div class="t m6b3 x3d h1c y9a6 ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">nothing that could be the source of the sound. </div><div class="t m43c x98 h1c y9a6 ff8 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I&apos;ll see you tonight, </div><div class="t m74e xa9 h1c y9a6 ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I </div><div class="t m88 x3d h1c y9a7 ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">silently said to the unseen noise. </div><div class="t m74f x38 h1c y9a8 ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I told Darren about the offending noise, and that night we </div><div class="t m1c2 x3d h1c y9a9 ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">stayed up late to investigate.

Soon </div><div class="t m668 x3d h1c y9ac ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">we heard the snoring sound that had awakened me the previous </div><div class="t mf x3d h1c y9ad ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">two nights. We peeked through a hole in the floor of our house and </div><div class="t m213 x3d h1c y9ae ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">burst into laughter.
