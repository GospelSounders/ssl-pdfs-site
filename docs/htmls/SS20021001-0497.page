One night I was awakened by loud snoring. </div><div class="t m94 x36 h20 y99e ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">At first </div><div class="t m74d x2f h17 y99f ff6 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I </div><div class="t m380 xc0 h20 y99f ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">thought that it was my partner, but the sound seemed to </div><div class="t m9 x36 h20 y9a0 ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">be coming from a different location. The snoring was so loud that I </div><div class="t m53f x36 h20 y9a1 ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">found it difficult to go back to sleep. </div><div class="t m287 x3d h20 y9a2 ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The next morning I forgot about the midnight noise, but that </div><div class="t m6de x36 h20 y9a3 ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">night the snoring awoke me again.

I was puzzled, but soon I fell </div><div class="t m268 x36 h20 y9a6 ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">asleep again. Early the next morning, I looked around but saw </div><div class="t m6b3 x3e h20 y9a7 ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">nothing that could be the source of the sound. </div><div class="t m43c x99 h20 y9a7 ff8 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I&apos;ll see you tonight, </div><div class="t m74e xa9 h20 y9a7 ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I </div><div class="t m88 x3e h20 y9a8 ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">silently said to the unseen noise. </div><div class="t m74f x39 h20 y9a9 ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I told Darren about the offending noise, and that night we </div><div class="t m1c2 x3e h20 y9aa ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">stayed up late to investigate.

We could hear some-</div><div class="t m749 x3e h20 y9ac ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">thing moving under the house. It stopped right under my bed. Soon </div><div class="t m668 x3e h20 y9ad ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">we heard the snoring sound that had awakened me the previous </div><div class="t mf x3e h20 y9ae ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">two nights.
