This is as it </div><div class="t mbe x22 h12 yb8 ff2 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">should be, for without Him in the central position our doctrines cannot be Christian. </div><div class="t mbf x22 h12 yb9 ff2 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">With Him at their center, their reliability and efficacy are assured. </div><div class="t mc0 x49 h12 yba ff2 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Each lesson is firmly based on Scripture, the source of all true doctrine. Many of </div><div class="t mc1 x22 h12 ybb ff2 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">those scriptures are well known; others may have received relatively little use. But </div><div class="t mc2 x22 h12 y38 ff2 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">they will all beir intensive study, especially when seen from a slightly different angle </div><div class="t mc3 x22 h12 ybc ff2 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">than that used in the past. Teachers and class members are therefore urged to study </div><div class="t mc4 x22 h12 ybd ff2 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the Word as deeply as possible. The Word &quot;is quick [or, living], and powerful, and </div><div class="t mc5 x22 h12 ybe ff2 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sharper than any twoedged sword, ... and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of </div><div class="t mb3 x22 h12 ybf ff2 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the heart&quot; (Heb. 4:12). Let us, then, daily study that Word, that God may reveal to us </div><div class="t mc6 x22 h12 yc0 ff2 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the purpose He had in.mind in having those particular passages included in the Bible. </div><div class="t mc7 x22 h12 yc1 ff2 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Classes where the Word is intensively studied will find sound religious instruction, </div><div class="t mc8 x22 h12 yc2 ff2 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">spiritual life, and inspiration for daily living. </div><div class="t mc9 x49 h12 yc3 ff2 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The Word is the mine from which doctrines are dug. The doctrines have ever been </div><div class="t mca x22 h12 yc4 ff2 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in the Word, embedded in it as gems and minerals are contained in rocks and soil. No </div><div class="t mcb x22 h12 yc5 ff2 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">true doctrine is of human devising; it is inherent in Holy Writ, there to be quarried by </div><div class="t mcc x22 h12 yc6 ff2 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">those who search the Scriptures to discover revelations of God&apos;s character and His </div><div class="t mcd x4a h12 yc7 ff2 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ways. These, when found, are formed into shapes more readily understood and </div><div class="t mce x22 h12 yc8 ff2 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">retained by His children. We should therefore not see doctrines as ready-made </div><div class="t mc4 x22 h12 yc9 ff2 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">declarations of belief that spare us further mental and spiritual exercise. We need </div><div class="t mcf x4a h12 yca ff2 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">them in portable form for convenience and as a means of expressing our beliefs to </div><div class="t md0 x22 h12 ycb ff2 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">others that they may know the substance of our faith. But each belief is infinitely </div><div class="t md1 x4a h12 y48 ff2 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">richer than its summary form. Indeed, to change the figure, the formal doctrine may </div><div class="t md2 x4a h12 ycc ff2 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">be little more than a label to list the contents of the treasure chest of truth. It is for us to </div><div class="t md3 x4a h12 ycd ff2 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">lift the lid and discover the wealth of revelation that lies within. </div><div class="t m97 x49 h12 yce ff2 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">These illustrations explain why a series of Sabbath School lessons on Christian </div><div class="t md4 x4a h12 ycf ff2 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">doctrine does not attempt to formulate those doctrines.

At home and in Sabbath School we need to explore </div><div class="t md9 x4a h12 yd3 ff2 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">beyond the formal statements and to discover both the principles that underlie the </div><div class="t mda x4a h12 yd4 ff2 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">doctrines and those that grow out of our beliefs. </div><div class="t md0 x49 h12 yd5 ff2 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">At one stage in church history it was said that Christians were divided into two </div><div class="t mbe x4a h12 yd6 ff2 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">classes—those who did not think at all, and those who did nothing but think.
