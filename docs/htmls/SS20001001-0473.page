As she passed her parents&apos; bedroom, she saw her </div><div class="t m20 x6 ha y314 ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">father sitting on the bed. Isis tiptoed in and gave him a big hug. She </div><div class="t m591 x6 ha y266 ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">flashed a smile and said, &quot;Daddy, I love you! And Jesus loves you, </div><div class="t m5cc x6 ha y267 ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">too!&quot; Then she turned and ran from the room, leaving her father alone. </div><div class="t m1c1 x4b ha y316 ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Isis&apos;s parents were not Adventists, but they sent their daughter to </div><div class="t m2d1 x6 ha y269 ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the Adventist school. There she was learning about God&apos;s love. </div><div class="t m611 x4b ha y40b ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Isis&apos;s father worked hard to provide his family with the best things in </div><div class="t m612 x6 ha y63c ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">life. But the more they had, the more he wanted, and soon he had trouble </div><div class="t m613 x6 ha y3e ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">paying his bills. He borrowed money to pay his bills, but when he could </div><div class="t m614 x6 ha y561 ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">not repay the loan one month the lender threatened to take his house. </div><div class="t m47a x4b ha y26b ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Worried, he borrowed money from another man to pay the lender. </div><div class="t m1b1 x6 ha y71a ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">But soon he could not pay the second loan. He felt trapped and faced </div><div class="t m199 x6 ha y15 ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">losing everything he had worked for. </div><div class="t m5ac x72 ha y71b ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Father saw only one way out of his problem. His life insurance </div><div class="t m615 x86 ha y26d ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">policy would provide enough to pay his bills and leave his family to </div><div class="t m616 x86 ha y1cb ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">live on for several years. But the only way they could collect that </div><div class="t m617 x86 ha y4dc ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">money was if he died. Desperate, Isis&apos;s father decided to end his life. </div><div class="t m618 x86 ha y4dd ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">He bought a gun and hid it. Then he sat down on the bed to think. </div><div class="t m2cc x72 ha y4de ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">But when Isis hugged him, he realized that no matter what hap-</div><div class="t m591 x86 ha y4df ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">pened, he could not do anything to hurt them! He went to find Isis. </div><div class="t m5e1 x6 ha y1cf ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Honey,&quot; he said, &quot;what did you just say about Jesus?&quot; </div><div class="t m5e8 x4b ha y4e0 ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Every day my teacher tells us that Jesus loves us,&quot; she answered. </div><div class="t m2d1 x86 ha yea ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Come to school with me tomorrow; my teacher will tell you.&quot; </div><div class="t m619 x72 ha yeb ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Daddy did not wait until the next day. He went to find his daughter&apos;s </div><div class="t m61a x86 ha y1d1 ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">teacher that afternoon. The teacher was not at school, but the principal </div><div class="t m60d x86 ha y723 ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and the pastor were. As they talked with him, he realized that without </div><div class="t m61b x86 ha y724 ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">God in his life, no amount of money could bring him happiness. The </div><div class="t m60 x86 ha y27 ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">pastor offered to study the Bible with him and show him how to find </div><div class="t mcb x70 ha y725 ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">God. That week the whole family began </div><div class="t m61c x70 ha y576 ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">attending the Adventist church. </div><div class="t m61d xb7 ha y726 ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Isis&apos;s father lost his job, and he had to sell </div><div class="t m61e x70 ha y727 ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">their house. But he says that God used his </div><div class="t m4bd x70 ha y728 ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">little girl to help him see what is really im-</div><div class="t m61f x70 ha y729 ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">portant in life.
