Very simple. </div><div class="t m2e7 x11 h9 y179 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Yet, there are more elements than first meet the eye. </div><div class="t m33b x11 h9 y3a3 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">To begin, there is the element of obedience on humanity&apos;s part. God </div><div class="t m33c x49 h9 y17a ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">says to Noah that he and his family shall go into the ark. They have their </div><div class="t m33d x49 h9 y45 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">part to do, and if they do not do it, the covenant is broken. If the </div><div class="t m1b3 x49 h9 y17b ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">covenant is broken, they are the ultimate losers, for in the end they are </div><div class="t m28b x49 h9 y17c ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the beneficiaries of the covenant. After all, if Noah said No to God and </div><div class="t m33e x49 h9 y17d ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">did not want to abide by it or said Yes but then changed his mind, what </div><div class="t m33f x49 h9 y3a4 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">would have been the results for him and his family? </div><div class="t m340 x11 hf y33b ff7 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">God says it is &quot;my covenant.&quot; What does that tell us about the basic </div><div class="t m341 x4a hf y294 ff7 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">nature of the covenant? What difference would there be in our concept </div><div class="t m342 x49 hf y295 ff7 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of the covenant if the Lord had called it &quot;our covenant&quot;? </div><div class="t m60 x11 h9 y180 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">However unique this particular situation, we see here the basic God-</div><div class="t m343 x4a h9 y181 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">human dynamic found in the covenant. By establishing &quot;my covenant&quot; </div><div class="t m344 x4a h9 y3a5 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">with Noah, God here again displays His grace. He shows that He is </div><div class="t m29e x4a h9 y3a6 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">willing to take the initiative in order to save human beings from the </div><div class="t m345 x4a h9 y183 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">results of their sins. In short, this covenant must not be seen as some </div><div class="t m338 x4a h9 y184 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sort of union of equals in which each &quot;partner&quot; in the covenant is </div><div class="t m16d x4a h9 y185 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">dependent upon the other. We could say that God &quot;benefits&quot; from the </div><div class="t m53 x4a h9 y346 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">covenant, but only in a radically different sense from which humans do. </div><div class="t m346 x4a h9 y3a7 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">He benefits in that those whom He loves will be given eternal life—no </div><div class="t m23 x4a h9 y3a8 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">small satisfation for the Lord (Isa. 53:11). But that is not to say that He </div><div class="t m347 x4a h9 y187 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">benefits in the same way we—on the receiving end of the same </div><div class="t m133 x4a h9 y3a9 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">covenant—benefit. </div><div class="t m348 x6c h9 y3aa ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Try this analogy: A man has fallen overboard from a boat in the midst </div><div class="t m349 x4a h9 y3ab ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of a storm. Someone on the deck says that he will throw a life preserver </div><div class="t m2cb x29 h9 y3ac ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">over to haul him in. The one in the water, however, has to agree to his </div><div class="t m5c x29 h9 y3ad ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">end of the &quot;deal,&quot; and that is to grab on and to hold on to what has been </div><div class="t m34a x29 h9 y3ae ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">provided him. That, in many ways, is what the covenant between God </div><div class="t m78 x29 h9 y3af ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and humanity is all about. </div><div class="t m2c5 x16 hf y3b0 ff7 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">How does that analogy help you understand the concept of grace </div><div class="t m34b x15 hf y3b1 ff7 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that exists in the covenant? How does it help you understand what </div><div class="t m1b0 x15 hf y3b2 ff7 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">your relationship to God even now needs to be based on? </div><div class="t m34c x51 h9 y355 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">25 </div></div><div class="pi" data-data='{"ctm":[1.000000,0.000000,0.000000,1.000000,0.000000,0.000000]}'></div></div>
