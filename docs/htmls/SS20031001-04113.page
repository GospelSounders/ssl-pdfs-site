H. Zachary </div><div class="t mb8 x4a h19 y6be ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Valli faced a huge problem. For years her husband had been </div><div class="t m45e x13 h19 y9dd ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">falling ever deeper into alcoholism. Often she suffered great pain </div><div class="t m3f7 x13 h19 y9de ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">from his drunken blows. Valli and her children often tried to </div><div class="t m3f3 x13 h19 y9df ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">escape his drunken wrath. When an evangelistic meeting was </div><div class="t m478 x13 h19 y25d ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">advertised in her village she decided to attend. </div><div class="t m40f x6c h19 y9e0 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">This was a difficult decision because the political party that </div><div class="t m23b x13 h19 y9e1 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">administered her village was determined that everyone should sup-</div><div class="t m13 x13 h19 y9e2 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">port the national religion. Her attendance brought extra burdens to </div><div class="t m6d3 x13 h19 y9e3 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">her personal life. Those who attended were forbidden to draw water </div><div class="t m8a x13 h19 y9e4 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">from the village well. Valli had to walk more than a mile (two </div><div class="t m17d x13 h19 y9e5 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">kilometers) to fetch water. However, as she began to experience a </div><div class="t m574 x13 h19 y9e6 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">new outlook on life, the long hike for water became bearable. </div><div class="t m425 x6c h19 y9e7 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">As Valli surrendered her life to Jesus, her life took on new </div><div class="t m4bc x13 h19 y9e8 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">directions. Old ways of thinking and acting disappeared. The </div><div class="t m242 x13 h19 y9e9 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Holy Spirit was performing a spiritual miracle in her life. Her </div><div class="t m13e x13 h19 y9ea ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">drunkard husband began to see these changes in his wife and was </div><div class="t m5cd x13 h19 y9eb ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">impressed by the power of the God that Valli so often referred to. </div><div class="t m114 x6c h19 y9ec ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Out of the depths of discouragement Valli&apos;s husband accompa-</div><div class="t m9b x70 h19 y9ed ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">nied his wife to the evangelistic service.

The entire family has </div><div class="t m138 x70 h19 y9f0 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">been baptized. </div><div class="t m6d4 x21 h19 y9f1 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Villagers were deeply impressed by the power of Jesus to </div><div class="t m13b x70 h19 y9f2 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">change lives. The prejudice against Christians began to wane. </div><div class="t m6d5 x21 h19 y5d ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Then a 6-year-old boy fell ill. The family could not afford medical </div><div class="t m6d6 x70 h19 y418 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">care, so they turned to the visiting teachers for help.
