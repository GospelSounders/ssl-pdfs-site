When his Adventist parents died when he was 8 years old, </div><div class="t m1cb x30 h24 y898 ff3 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">he was sent to live with an unbelieving uncle. There he lived in </div><div class="t m4d x30 h24 y899 ff3 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">virtual slavery, forbidden to attend school and forced to work hard </div><div class="t m26b x30 h24 y89a ff3 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">all day. Often he was beaten for the other children&apos;s misdeeds. </div><div class="t m526 x45 h24 y89b ff3 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">When Pena was 16, he left his uncle&apos;s home and joined the </div><div class="t m4a6 x30 h24 y89c ff3 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">guerrilla army fighting for Mozambique&apos;s freedom. Pena served in </div><div class="t m52c x30 h24 y89d ff3 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the army for several years before he was wounded in combat and </div><div class="t m7f x30 h24 y89e ff3 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">discharged. </div><div class="t m525 x16 h24 y89f ff3 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Pena returned to his hometown where he met an Adventist </div><div class="t mc8 x30 h24 y8a0 ff3 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">pastor who reintroduced him to Jesus Christ and the faith of his </div><div class="t m5ae x30 h24 y8a1 ff3 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">parents. It was then that Pena realized God had repeatedly saved his </div><div class="t m83 x30 h24 y8a2 ff3 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">life during his troubled youth. Pena accepted God&apos;s love and Jesus&apos; </div><div class="t m80 x30 h24 y744 ff3 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sacrifice and was baptized. Then he set out to work for God. </div><div class="t m2e1 x16 h24 y8a3 ff3 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Living off the military retirement pay he received, Pena traveled </div><div class="t m4c9 x30 h24 y8a4 ff3 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">from district to district, telling people about God&apos;s grace. Because </div><div class="t m5af x30 h24 y8a5 ff3 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the war created a deep suspicion of strangers, Pena introduced </div><div class="t m2a7 x30 h24 y4a2 ff3 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">himself as an evangelist to the traditional authority or district leader. </div><div class="t m3b7 x30 h24 y8a6 ff3 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The area leader was compelled to introduce Pena to the people and </div><div class="t m5b0 x30 h24 y8a7 ff3 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">provide him a place to hold meetings. This made Pena&apos;s work </div><div class="t m25c x30 h24 y8a8 ff3 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">somewhat easier because the people knew who he was before he </div><div class="t m5b1 x30 h24 y8a9 ff3 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">started witnessing. He studied with anyone who showed interest </div><div class="t m3b6 x30 h24 y8aa ff3 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and prepared many for baptism. When a group was ready for </div><div class="t m590 x30 h24 y8ab ff3 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">baptism, Pena would summon a minister to baptize them. Then he </div><div class="t m5b2 x30 h24 y4a8 ff3 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">moved to another area and began again. In eight years Pena planted </div><div class="t m75 x30 h24 y8ac ff3 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">15 new churches, all of which continue to grow and multiply. </div><div class="t m5b3 x16 h24 y8ad ff3 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">But Pena has suffered for his faith. Once he was accused of being </div><div class="t m317 x30 h24 y8ae ff3 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">a spy. He was tied up and spent the night in prison, under threat of </div><div class="t m3d7 x30 h24 y8af ff3 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">death. After praying well into the night, he received assurance from </div><div class="t m5b4 x30 h24 y8b0 ff3 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">God that his life would be spared. Three of the churches Pena </div><div class="t m2c1 x30 h24 y8b1 ff3 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">planted were in Muslim areas, where he met with intense persecu-</div><div class="t m174 x50 h24 y8b2 ff3 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tion. And after one young man accepted the Adventist message, his </div><div class="t m48 x50 h24 y8b3 ff3 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">family tried to kill Pena. </div><div class="t m174 x16 h24 y8b4 ff3 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The civil war in Mozambique is over, but the war for the human </div><div class="t m27e x50 h24 y8b5 ff3 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">soul continues, and Pena continues to seek recruits to enlist in God&apos;s </div><div class="t m1dd x50 h24 y8b6 ff3 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">army. And God continues to reward his efforts with baptisms and </div><div class="t m78 x50 h24 y8b7 ff3 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">new churches. </div><div class="t m5b5 x4a h27 y8b8 ff2 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Januario Alssone de Pena is a lay evangelist living and </div><div class="t m47a x50 h27 y8b9 ff2 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">working in Mozambique, East Africa. </div><div class="t m7f x47 h24 y8ba ff3 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">For Current Newsbreak, Call 1-800-648-5824. </div></div><div class="pi" data-data='{"ctm":[1.000000,0.000000,0.000000,1.000000,0.000000,0.000000]}'></div></div>
