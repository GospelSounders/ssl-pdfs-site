But though </div><div class="t m353 x27 h16 ya4a ff3 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">it may have seemed new to His hearers at the time, this was not a new </div><div class="t m129 x4 h16 ya4b ff3 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">command. It reflected the will and character of God since the very </div><div class="t m1b0 x4 h16 ya4c ff3 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">beginning. As John wrote in the previous letter, &quot;This command I am </div><div class="t m664 x4 h16 yada ff3 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">writing you is not new; it is the old command, the one you have had </div><div class="t m18f x27 h16 ya4d ff3 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">from the very beginning. The old command is the message you have </div><div class="t m442 x4 h16 yadb ff3 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">already heard. But the command I now write you is new, because its </div><div class="t m3b4 x4 h16 yadc ff3 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">truth is seen in Christ and also in you&quot; (1 John 2:7, 8, TEV). God&apos;s </div><div class="t m45e x4 h16 yadd ff3 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">command becomes new in the person of Jesus Christ—in Him it is </div><div class="t m4ac x4 h16 ya4f ff3 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">most clearly revealed. This command was at the heart of Jesus&apos; </div><div class="t md5 x4 h16 ya1e ff3 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">message. </div><div class="t m631 x2e h26 yade ff2 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Commands sometimes seem like trying to force people to </div><div class="t m136 x4 h26 yadf ff2 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">do something against their will. Is this what God wants? John </div><div class="t m317 x27 h26 yae0 ff2 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">7:17. </div><div class="t m1bc x2e h16 ya57 ff3 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Only by walking in the truth can we find true obedience, which </div><div class="t m40a x4 h16 y89a ff3 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">does not come through force or compulsion. We need to emphasize </div><div class="t m5e8 x4 h16 yae1 ff3 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">this point, for the devil has been very successful in suggesting that </div><div class="t m2b x4 h16 yae2 ff3 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">God does indeed operate this way. It can be said that ideas of divinely-</div><div class="t md3 x4 h16 ya5b ff3 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">approved coercion are to be found in every example of human reli-</div><div class="t m177 x4 h16 ya5c ff3 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">gion. But since Jesus stresses the love command, it becomes clear that </div><div class="t mab x4 h16 ya5d ff3 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">God never compels or pressures any of His children to obey Him. </div><div class="t m4dc x27 h16 yae3 ff3 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Indeed, to operate from such principles of force and compulsion </div><div class="t m521 x4 h16 y8a0 ff3 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">would be to negate the whole great controversy and its evidence, </div><div class="t m336 x4 h16 ya5f ff3 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">accumulated at such tremendous cost. For if God can achieve His </div><div class="t m284 x27 h16 yae4 ff3 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">intentions by force, why does He not do so? Why did He not do so in </div><div class="t m64f x4 h16 y8a3 ff3 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the very beginning? </div><div class="t m44c x2e h16 ya60 ff3 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;If a man is to be convinced, the truth as it is in Jesus must be </div><div class="t mf5 x4 h16 yae5 ff3 fsc fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">presented to his mind, and must appeal to his heart.
