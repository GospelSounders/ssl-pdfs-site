Pain tore at his leg, which lay at an </div><div class="t m9 x7c h12 y96b ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">odd angle. He knew it was broken. </div><div class="t m757 x70 h12 y861 ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The Banu family had left their home in Romania and come to Spain </div><div class="t m564 x7c h12 y96c ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in search of a better future. Daniel found work as a builder. The pay </div><div class="t m758 x9 h12 y860 ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was not high, but they could live on it as long as nothing unexpected </div><div class="t m5b0 x9 h12 y863 ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">happened. Then, two weeks later, Daniel fell from the second floor of </div><div class="t m582 x9 h12 y96d ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the building on which he was working and suffered a compound </div><div class="t m45c x9 h12 y865 ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">fracture of his leg. </div><div class="t m759 x70 h12 y96e ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">At the hospital, a surgeon put a metal plate in his leg. When Banu </div><div class="t m3ac x9 h12 y867 ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">awoke, his wife stood tearfully beside him. &quot;Where was your angel </div><div class="t m56f x9 h12 y868 ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">when you fell?&quot; she asked. He answered that if his angel had not been </div><div class="t m3b6 x9 h12 y96f ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">there, the fall might have killed him; but God saved him. </div><div class="t m3b9 x70 h12 y869 ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Daniel returned home to recuperate. Without his income, the family </div><div class="t m342 x9 h12 y970 ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">faced a serious crisis. Then Daniel noticed that the wound looked </div><div class="t mbd x9 h12 y86b ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">infected. The doctor ordered antibiotics, but the infection spread </div><div class="t m58e x9 h12 y86c ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">through his body. Doctors feared he might not live. </div><div class="t med x70 h12 y86d ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Daniel&apos;s wife worked an hour a day as a housekeeper when some-</div><div class="t m1d8 x9 h12 y86e ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">one could stay with Daniel. This was the family&apos;s only income. She </div><div class="t m743 x9 h12 y86f ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">went to buy Daniel&apos;s medicine but did not have enough money to pay </div><div class="t m527 x9 h12 y256 ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">for it. She returned home crying. But the couple claimed God&apos;s prom-</div><div class="t m57c x9 h12 y971 ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ise in Psalm 46:1, &quot;God is our help in trouble.&quot; They prayed that God </div><div class="t m75a x9 h12 y258 ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">would not let them down. When three different people, virtual strang-</div><div class="t m6a5 x9 h12 y972 ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ers, offered them money, their faith was strengthened. Another organi-</div><div class="t m45a x9 h12 y25a ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">zation paid their rent for six months and provided food. </div><div class="t m489 x65 h12 y5e8 ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The doctor advised surgery to remove the metal plate to save </div><div class="t m44f x9 h12 y25c ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Daniel&apos;s life, but the family could not afford the surgery. The doctor </div><div class="t m348 x9 h12 y973 ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">said, &quot;If you believe in prayer, you&apos;d better pray. Only God can save </div><div class="t m397 x9 h12 y25e ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">you now.&quot; The couple refused to give up hope that God would heal </div><div class="t m58e x9 h12 y974 ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Daniel. As they prayed, their faith grew stronger. </div><div class="t m2a9 x65 h12 y975 ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Slowly the infection subsided.
