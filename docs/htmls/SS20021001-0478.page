So why give oil to another and then have your own </div><div class="t m260 x44 h1c y23e ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">light go out? It would make no sense. </div><div class="t m6ab x45 h14 y80d ff6 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">What essential message is contained in the refusal of those to </div><div class="t m47e x44 h14 y241 ff6 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">give others of their oil? (See also Ezek. 14:14, 20.) </div><div class="t m37b x45 h1c y80e ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The parable shows that the &quot;oil supply&quot; is personal.

You cannot take your hope and implant it into someone </div><div class="t m6ac x44 h1c y14e ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">else. Hope has to be personally experienced, personally believed. This </div><div class="t m5b8 x44 h1c y14f ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">is the &quot;oil of gladness&quot; (Heb. 1:9). </div><div class="t m334 x45 h1c y199 ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">In Israel, oil was a much-valued commodity. So, too, taking oil as the </div><div class="t m367 x44 h1c y150 ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">symbol of hope and salvation, we have a great need for oil. More than </div><div class="t m6ad x44 h1c y151 ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">anything, this is what is required in the church and in our individual lives. </div><div class="t m36c x45 h1c y152 ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The &quot;position of suspense&quot; was not easy for any of the girls in the </div><div class="t m5c6 x44 h1c y153 ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">parable.
