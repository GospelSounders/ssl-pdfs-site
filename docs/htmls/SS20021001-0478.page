So why give oil to another and then have your own </div><div class="t m260 x45 h20 y23f ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">light go out?

(See also Ezek. 14:14, 20.) </div><div class="t m37b x46 h20 y80f ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The parable shows that the &quot;oil supply&quot; is personal.

This </div><div class="t m5b8 x45 h20 y150 ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">is the &quot;oil of gladness&quot; (Heb. 1:9). </div><div class="t m334 x46 h20 y19a ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">In Israel, oil was a much-valued commodity. So, too, taking oil as the </div><div class="t m367 x45 h20 y151 ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">symbol of hope and salvation, we have a great need for oil. More than </div><div class="t m6ad x45 h20 y152 ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">anything, this is what is required in the church and in our individual lives. </div><div class="t m36c x46 h20 y153 ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The &quot;position of suspense&quot; was not easy for any of the girls in the </div><div class="t m5c6 x45 h20 y154 ff5 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">parable.
