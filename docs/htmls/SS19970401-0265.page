But most people in Hong Kong do not have Christ. </div><div class="t m17 x40 h1f y7a7 ff3 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">With the majority of residents living in high-rise apartments, it </div><div class="t m14b x7 h1f y7a8 ff3 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">is difficult to make contact with them. Non-residents cannot enter </div><div class="t m2c7 x7 h1f y7a9 ff3 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">an apartment building without an invitation. So how do Christians </div><div class="t m342 x7 h1f y7aa ff3 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">reach others for Christ? That&apos;s the challenge. And with the im-</div><div class="t m276 x7 h1f y7ab ff3 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">pending reversion of Hong Kong to China, it is a challenge that </div><div class="t m144 x7 h1f y7ac ff3 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">must be met soon. </div><div class="t m58e x40 h1f y7ad ff3 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Recently a group of Adventists began a small-group program </div><div class="t m20b x7 h1f y7ae ff3 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">called cell-group evangelism. Members began meeting in their </div><div class="t m58f x7 h1f y7af ff3 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">apartments to study the Bible and to pray. They began inviting </div><div class="t m563 x7 h1f y7b0 ff3 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">friends, and the cell groups grew. When groups reached a given </div><div class="t m1f6 x7 h1f y7b1 ff3 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">number of members, they divided and formed more groups. There </div><div class="t m227 x7 h1f y7b2 ff3 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">were women&apos;s groups, students&apos; groups, health groups, and others. </div><div class="t m19f x47 h1f y7b3 ff3 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Each group reached out to others, especially non-Christians, with </div><div class="t m221 x7 h1f y7b4 ff3 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">similar interests. Friendships formed, and trust grew. </div><div class="t m235 x40 h1f y7b5 ff3 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Then a series of evangelistic meetings was planned. Normally, </div><div class="t mbe x47 h1f y7b6 ff3 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">thousands of dollars of advertising would bring only a few non-</div><div class="t m590 x47 h1f y7b7 ff3 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Christians to such meetings. But this time the focus was on cell-</div><div class="t mb4 x47 h1f y7b8 ff3 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">group members and contacts. Without a single pamphlet or tract, </div><div class="t m44f x47 h1f y8d ff3 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">nearly 1,000 people attended each meeting, and more than 50 </div><div class="t m2a5 x47 h1f y7b9 ff3 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">persons were baptized. </div><div class="t m17f x21 h1f y7ba ff3 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">One new member is Christine, whose junior high school teacher </div><div class="t m3b4 x47 h1f y7bb ff3 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">invited her to a cell-group meeting. This was her first contact with </div><div class="t m591 x47 h1f y7bc ff3 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Christianity. She liked the spiritual emphasis, and eventually en-</div><div class="t m28d x47 h1f y7bd ff3 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">rolled in Hong Kong Adventist College. Then came the evangelis-</div><div class="t m592 x47 h1f y7be ff3 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tic meetings, where she gave her life to Christ. But she did not </div><div class="t m593 x47 h1f y7bf ff3 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">know how to have devotions or to find fellowship with other </div><div class="t m594 x47 h1f y7c0 ff3 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Christians. She was introduced to a student cell group, where she </div><div class="t m502 x24 h1f y7c1 ff3 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">learned how to study the Bible more deeply and share with others </div><div class="t mc0 x47 h1f y7c2 ff3 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">her feelings about life and God. She found encouragement, sup-</div><div class="t m17 x24 h1f y7c3 ff3 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">port, and training in the cell group. It wasn&apos;t long before Christine </div><div class="t m595 x47 h1f y7c4 ff3 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was baptized. </div><div class="t m596 x21 h1f y7c5 ff3 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Join with our members in Hong Kong as they pray for the </div><div class="t m102 x24 h1f y7c6 ff3 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">millions who do not know Christ.
