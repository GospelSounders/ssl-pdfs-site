Farmland and forest </div><div class="t m377 x98 hc y3aa ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">surround small clusters of homes. Life in these villages has changed </div><div class="t m378 x98 hc y3ab ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">little over the years. Most people farm or work in nearby textile </div><div class="t mfa x98 hc y3ac ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">mills, much as their parents did. And most people die in the faith </div><div class="t m379 x98 hc y3ad ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">into which they were born. </div><div class="t m118 x3e hc y3ae ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">During Communist times the few Adventists who lived in such </div><div class="t m37a xb hc y3c ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">villages had no ordained pastor. They worshiped quietly in their </div><div class="t m11c xb hc y3af ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">homes. The young leader of one such group had a zeal for sharing </div><div class="t m29b xb hc y3b0 ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">his faith with others. He could never hope to study theology in a </div><div class="t m37b x98 hc y3b1 ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">seminary, but he studied his Bible and became an active soul </div><div class="t m37c xb hc y3b2 ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">winner. </div><div class="t m37d x3e hc y3b3 ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Word of this young man&apos;s evangelistic efforts spread, and even-</div><div class="t m37e xb hc y44 ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tually the government learned of his religious activities. They tried </div><div class="t m21a xb hc y3b4 ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to quiet him through threats, but that did not work. Finally the </div><div class="t m37f xb hc y3b5 ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">government sent him to live and work in the forest. His job was to </div><div class="t m1a7 xb hc y3b6 ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">gather pitch to be used in the manufacture of plastics and chemi-</div><div class="t m380 xb hc y3b7 ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">cals. This assignment, the officials felt, would keep him from </div><div class="t mf9 xb hc y3b8 ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">causing trouble for them, and since few people lived in the forest, </div><div class="t m198 xb hc y4d ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">he would have few people to influence. </div><div class="t m100 x42 hc y233 ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">But the man found that his new job did not require him to work </div><div class="t m251 xb hc y3b9 ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">long hours. He had even more time to visit people and share his </div><div class="t m376 xb hc y235 ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">faith. After work he rode his motorcycle into the surrounding </div><div class="t m362 xb hc y3ba ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">villages, where he shared the Bible with anyone who would listen. </div><div class="t m223 x42 hc y3bb ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">For years the young man worked in the forest, gathering pitch </div><div class="t m37c xb hc y56 ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">by day and visiting people at night. He traveled to every village in </div><div class="t m381 xb hc y3bc ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the region, sharing his love for Christ and studying the Bible with </div><div class="t m382 xb hc y3bd ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">anyone who was interested. He organized home worship groups </div><div class="t md6 xb hc y3be ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and encouraged the believers. Some groups had only a few mem-</div><div class="t m8b xb hc y3bf ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">bers, but others had 30 or 40 members. And because he faithfully </div><div class="t m383 xb hc y3c0 ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">gathered his quota of pitch in the forest and limited his visitation to </div><div class="t m1b5 xb hc y3c1 ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the small villages, the government officials seldom bothered him. </div><div class="t m384 x42 hc y3c2 ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">When Communism in Latvia fell and people were again free to </div><div class="t m24 xb hc y3c3 ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">worship publicly, these small groups of Adventists sponsored Bible </div><div class="t m385 xb hc y3c4 ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">seminars and evangelistic meetings, inviting their neighbors and </div><div class="t m386 x29 hc y3c5 ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">family members.
