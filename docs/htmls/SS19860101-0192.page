At the very moment Paul was writing this letter a Roman centurion </div><div class="t m193 x19 h22 ya91 ff5 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">stood guard over him, reminding him that life indeed is a battle. (See Acts </div><div class="t m14 x19 h22 ya92 ff5 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">28:16.) He could still vividly recall Julius, the Roman soldier who had </div><div class="t m600 x19 h22 ya93 ff5 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">charge of him on the voyage to Rome. This made him aware of the garb </div><div class="t m49e x19 h22 ya94 ff5 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and the life of a soldier. He could sense the unswerving loyalty of a sol-</div><div class="t m18b x19 h22 ya95 ff5 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">dier for his commander. He could see that a soldier was duty-bound to </div><div class="t m2c9 x19 h22 ya96 ff5 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">endure any amount of sacrifice, discomfort, or pain in order to fulfill his </div><div class="t m155 x19 h22 ya97 ff5 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">commission.
