Sometimes she took </div><div class="t m23e x51 hd y9b3 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Ruthie with her to bars in order to attract men whom she could </div><div class="t m6e x51 hd y42d ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">invite home. </div><div class="t m6da x50 hd y9b4 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">In spite of this upbringing, Ruthie did well in school. And </div><div class="t m96 x51 hd y9b5 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">when she was 17, she gave her heart to God. Two years later, she </div><div class="t m47 x51 hd ydb ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">met a man who asked her to marry him. Finally, she thought, she </div><div class="t m228 x51 hd y9b6 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">would have a real home and family. </div><div class="t m39 x50 hd y432 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">But to her horror her husband was even more abusive to her. </div><div class="t m66c x51 hd y9b7 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Frustrated and confused and in a fit of rage, she killed someone. </div><div class="t m5c5 x51 hd y434 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">She never denied her crime and was sentenced to life in prison. </div><div class="t m3ff x50 hd y9b8 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I met Ruthie in 1993, when she sent a tithe check to the </div><div class="t m3fa x51 hd y4e ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">General Conference. But the letter that accompanied the check </div><div class="t m561 x51 hd y436 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was full of anger toward those who had hurt her. Much of her </div><div class="t m26e x21 hd y437 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">anger, I learned, was directed at her mother, whom she loved but </div><div class="t m6db x21 hd y438 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">blamed for the way her life had gone. I realized that unless </div><div class="t m301 x21 hd y439 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Ruthie forgave those who had wronged her, she could never </div><div class="t m66 x21 hd y43a ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">experience the joy of salvation in Christ. </div><div class="t m254 x22 hd y58 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I wrote to Ruthie and encouraged her to look to Jesus, not to </div><div class="t m34a x21 hd y43b ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">other humans and their frailties. In trying to show Ruthie how to </div><div class="t m409 x21 hd y9b9 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">forgive others, I learned some important truths that changed my </div><div class="t m6dc x21 hd y9ba ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">life as well. But her letters remained so full of anger and </div><div class="t m198 x21 hd y43d ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">unforgiveness that they depressed me. Finally I had to stop corre-</div><div class="t m28f x21 hd y9bb ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sponding with her. But I told her that I would continue to send her </div><div class="t m6dd x21 hd y9bc ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Christian literature and I would never stop praying for her. I </div><div class="t m4b4 x21 hd y70d ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">asked my prayer partners to put Ruthie at the top of their list. </div><div class="t m23f x29 hd y9bd ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">For months I did not hear from </div><div class="t m19a xc hd y9be ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Ruthie, but we continued praying for </div><div class="t m3a5 xc hd y443 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">her.
