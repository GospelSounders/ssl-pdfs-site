Notice, however, what it is that these nations had done </div><div class="t m27f x48 h1f y290 ff3 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that brought the wrath of God upon them. Damascus (vs. 3) apparently </div><div class="t mb7 x48 h1f y291 ff3 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">used excessive violence against one of its neighbors, while both Gaza </div><div class="t m280 x48 h1f y292 ff3 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and Tyre were condemned for some sort of slave trade (vss. 6, 9). </div><div class="t m281 x2b h1f y293 ff3 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">What&apos;s fascinating is that, in these texts, there is no condemnation </div><div class="t m282 x48 h1f y294 ff3 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">against them for idolatry, for worshiping false gods, or for not treat-</div><div class="t m283 x48 h1f y295 ff3 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ing the poor with respect. Instead the condemnation deals exclusively </div><div class="t m284 x48 h1f y296 ff3 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">with their abuse of the most basic human rights. </div><div class="t m285 x2b hb y297 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The Bible teaches that through the law sin is known (Rom. </div><div class="t m286 x48 hb y298 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">3:20).

Read </div><div class="t m288 x48 hb y29a ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">what Paul wrote in Romans 2:12-16 for some added insight. </div><div class="t m289 x2b h1f y13b ff3 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Though only ancient Israel had been given the Ten Command-</div><div class="t m28a x6e h1f y13c ff3 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ments, there are numerous examples all through the ancient world </div><div class="t m28b x6e h1f y13d ff3 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that many other nations believed many of the same principles regard-</div><div class="t m28c x6e h1f y13e ff3 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ing good and evil.
