The Bible has little to say about His </div><div class="t mad x18 h18 yb9 ff1 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">nature, but the facts of His personality and place in the Godhead are </div><div class="t mae x18 h18 yba ff1 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">fundamental to an understanding of His work. </div><div class="t maf xb h18 ybb ff1 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">In every age, the Holy Spirit has called fallen human beings from sin </div><div class="t mb0 x18 h18 ybc ff1 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to holiness, from rejection of God to friendship and fellowship with </div><div class="t mb1 x18 h18 ybd ff1 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Him, from being slaves of natural impulses, selfish desires and ambi-</div><div class="t mb2 x18 h18 ybe ff1 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tions, to purity of mind and humble service for others.
