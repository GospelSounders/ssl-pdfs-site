The Bible has little to say about His </div><div class="t mad x17 h14 yb8 ff1 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">nature, but the facts of His personality and place in the Godhead are </div><div class="t mae x17 h14 yb9 ff1 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">fundamental to an understanding of His work. </div><div class="t maf xa h14 yba ff1 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">In every age, the Holy Spirit has called fallen human beings from sin </div><div class="t mb0 x17 h14 ybb ff1 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to holiness, from rejection of God to friendship and fellowship with </div><div class="t mb1 x17 h14 ybc ff1 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Him, from being slaves of natural impulses, selfish desires and ambi-</div><div class="t mb2 x17 h14 ybd ff1 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tions, to purity of mind and humble service for others. The work of the </div><div class="t mb3 x17 h14 ybe ff1 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Holy Spirit before Christ&apos;s time was fundamentally what it is today, </div><div class="t mb4 x17 h14 ybf ff1 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">with the difference that, because of the cross, the Spirit is now the </div><div class="t m67 x17 h14 yc0 ff1 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">personal representative of Christ.

But God&apos;s timing of these </div><div class="t mba x17 h14 yc5 ff1 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and other events in salvation history is related to His foreknowledge of </div><div class="t mbb x4b h14 yc6 ff1 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the spiritual condition of the world and the church prior to the occur-</div><div class="t mbc x4b h14 yc7 ff1 fse fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">rence of the events.
