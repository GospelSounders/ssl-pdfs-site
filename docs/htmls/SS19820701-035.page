Though it is an old theme, every generation of believers must find the </div><div class="t m86 x7 h15 y79 ff4 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">answers to that question for itself. And each unit of believers must seek its own </div><div class="t m87 x7 h15 y7a ff4 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">forms of relating to the world in the particular setting in which it is called to </div><div class="t m88 x7 h15 y7b ff4 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">witness for Christ. </div><div class="t m89 x2e h15 y7c ff4 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The reason for this is clear. Our world is constantly changing. New chal-</div><div class="t m8a x7 h15 y7d ff4 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">lenges are thereby arising to the life of the church, its mission, and to the believ-</div><div class="t m8b x7 h15 y7e ff4 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ers&apos; growth in grace and in Christian maturity. Solutions from the past do not </div><div class="t m8c x7 h15 y7f ff4 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">always fit the way in which we live today. Moreover, our world is made of </div><div class="t m31 x8 h15 y80 ff4 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">vastly different cultures and societies, of religions and ideologies, of political </div><div class="t m8d x7 h15 y81 ff4 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and social orders, of values and patterns of thinking. That means that the </div><div class="t m8e x8 h15 y82 ff4 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">relationship between the Christian and the world cannot, and </div><div class="t m8f x31 h15 y82 ff8 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">should </div><div class="t m4a x32 h15 y82 ff4 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">not, take </div><div class="t m90 x7 h15 y83 ff4 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">exactly the same forms everywhere. For instance, what appears to be an ac-</div><div class="t m91 x7 h15 y84 ff4 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ceptable form of Christian behavior in one culture—say dress, music, or social </div><div class="t m92 x8 h15 y85 ff4 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">patterns between male and female—may not be appropriate in another. The </div><div class="t m93 x7 h15 y86 ff4 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">same applies to the relationship of the Christian to government, the economic </div><div class="t m94 x7 h15 y87 ff4 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">order, or social institutions. Though the varying and ever changing circum-</div><div class="t m95 x8 h15 y88 ff4 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">stances in the world may demand different </div><div class="t m96 x33 h15 y88 ff8 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">forms </div><div class="t m97 x34 h15 y88 ff4 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of relating to the world, all </div><div class="t m98 x8 h15 y89 ff4 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">these forms must be firmly based on sound biblical principles. To discover </div><div class="t m99 x8 h15 y8a ff4 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the biblical principles that deal with the relationship between the Christian and </div><div class="t m9a x8 h15 y8b ff4 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the world is the primary purpose of this series of lessons. </div><div class="t m9b x2e h15 y8c ff4 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Our Adventist pioneers lived in the expectation of the immediate coming of </div><div class="t m9c x8 h15 y8d ff4 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">our Lord and Saviour. Their whole life and mission had such an urgency that </div><div class="t m9d x8 h15 y8e ff4 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">they considered everything and every activity in the world which did not con-</div><div class="t m9e x8 h15 y8f ff4 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tribute directly to the advance of their cause as waste, if not actually sinful. </div><div class="t m9f x8 h15 y90 ff4 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">After nearly 140 years the believers have, in some places, lost much of that </div><div class="t ma0 x5 h15 y2a ff4 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">urgency. This is greatly affecting the attitude of the Christian toward the </div><div class="t ma1 x8 h15 y91 ff4 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">world and the things that are of this world. We realize, as Ellen White stated, </div><div class="t ma2 x5 h15 y92 ff4 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that as long as they are in the world, God&apos;s people have to do with the things of </div><div class="t m35 x8 h15 y93 ff4 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the world. (See </div><div class="t m4b x23 h15 y94 ff8 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Testimonies, vol. </div><div class="t ma3 xd h15 y95 ff4 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">5, p. 459.) However, believers who take their </div><div class="t ma4 x8 h15 y96 ff4 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">calling seriously must know that their first citizenship is in the kingdom of God. </div><div class="t ma5 x5 h15 y97 ff4 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Its goals and principles, therefore, should be our first concern. At the same time </div><div class="t ma6 x5 h15 y98 ff4 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">we must become more aware of the fact that these goals and principles are to be </div><div class="t ma7 x5 h15 y99 ff4 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">realized in </div><div class="t ma8 x35 h15 y9a ff8 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">this </div><div class="t ma9 x36 h15 y9a ff4 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">world. To that end Christ sent us into the world so that all </div><div class="t maa x5 h15 y9b ff4 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">people may have opportunity to be saved and come to the knowledge of the </div><div class="t mab x5 h15 y33 ff4 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">truth. (See 1 Tim. 2:4.) The Christian must therefore constantly ask him-</div><div class="t m60 x5 h15 y9c ff4 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">self: In what ways can I best represent Christ in the world, at work, in my daily </div><div class="t mac x5 h15 y9d ff4 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">activities, among neighbors and friends? And by what attitudes, life-style, and </div><div class="t mad x5 h15 y9e ff4 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">behavior can I best make the kingdom of God a present reality as well as a hope </div><div class="t m33 x5 h15 y9f ff4 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">for the future? </div><div class="t mae x37 h16 ya0 ff3 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">5 </div></div><div class="pi" data-data='{"ctm":[1.000000,0.000000,0.000000,1.000000,0.000000,0.000000]}'></div></div>
