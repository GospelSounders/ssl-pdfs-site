Now we will consider the son who declined </div><div class="t m331 xa h16 y3c6 ff3 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">his father&apos;s command, but later obeyed. </div><div class="t m5aa x13 h16 y520 ff3 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Contrast the attitude and response of this son with the attitude </div><div class="t m2ef x30 h16 y521 ff3 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and response of his brother.

Then he went.

The laying aside of pride reflects </div><div class="t m3d5 xa h16 y7e5 ff3 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">several promising qualities: (1) reflectiveness; (2) humility; (3) willing-</div><div class="t m5b0 xa h16 yca ff3 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ness to admit wrong; and (4) a desire to do better. </div><div class="t m304 x13 h16 y529 ff3 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The son we studied yesterday represented the Pharisees. Whom </div><div class="t m171 xa h16 y7e6 ff3 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">does this son represent, and why? Matt. 21:31, 32. </div><div class="t m44e x13 h16 y52b ff3 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Tax collectors and prostitutes symbolize all social and religious </div><div class="t m224 xa h16 y7e7 ff3 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">outcasts. But Jesus states that there is more hope for people such as </div><div class="t m97 xa h16 y7e8 ff3 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">these than there is hope for people who wrap their pride around them </div><div class="t m26d xa h16 y7e9 ff3 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">like flamboyant scarves. Pride recognizes no need. But those who </div><div class="t m5b1 xa h16 y7ea ff3 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">recognize themselves as sinners realize they need a Saviour and </div><div class="t m291 xa h16 y7eb ff3 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">become dismayed at the thought of being eternally separated from </div><div class="t m273 xa h16 y7ec ff3 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">God.

Beginning with its launch in 1938 until its </div><div class="t m43f xa h16 y7ee ff3 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">retirement 40 years later, the Queen Mary was the largest ship to </div><div class="t m51f xa h16 y7ef ff3 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">navigate the seas.

But as they began their task, </div><div class="t m305 xa h16 y58c ff3 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the stacks crumbled. All that remained were 30 coats of paint applied </div><div class="t m5b5 xa h16 y58d ff3 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">over the decades. The 3/4-inch steel that had formed the stacks had </div><div class="t m113 xa h16 y58e ff3 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">completely rusted away. The Pharisees&apos; religion was much like those </div><div class="t m414 xa h16 y58f ff3 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">smokestacks; their profession like the 30 coats of paint. Theirs was the </div><div class="t m5b6 xa h16 y7f2 ff3 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">appearance of holiness.
