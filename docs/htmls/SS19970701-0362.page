The laying aside of pride reflects </div><div class="t m3d5 xb h1a y7e6 ff3 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">several promising qualities: (1) reflectiveness; (2) humility; (3) willing-</div><div class="t m5b0 xb h1a ycb ff3 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ness to admit wrong; and (4) a desire to do better. </div><div class="t m304 x14 h1a y52a ff3 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The son we studied yesterday represented the Pharisees. Whom </div><div class="t m171 xb h1a y7e7 ff3 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">does this son represent, and why?

But Jesus states that there is more hope for people such as </div><div class="t m97 xb h1a y7e9 ff3 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">these than there is hope for people who wrap their pride around them </div><div class="t m26d xb h1a y7ea ff3 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">like flamboyant scarves. Pride recognizes no need. But those who </div><div class="t m5b1 xb h1a y7eb ff3 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">recognize themselves as sinners realize they need a Saviour and </div><div class="t m291 xb h1a y7ec ff3 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">become dismayed at the thought of being eternally separated from </div><div class="t m273 xb h1a y7ed ff3 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">God.

But as they began their task, </div><div class="t m305 xb h1a y58d ff3 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the stacks crumbled. All that remained were 30 coats of paint applied </div><div class="t m5b5 xb h1a y58e ff3 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">over the decades. The 3/4-inch steel that had formed the stacks had </div><div class="t m113 xb h1a y58f ff3 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">completely rusted away. The Pharisees&apos; religion was much like those </div><div class="t m414 xb h1a y590 ff3 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">smokestacks; their profession like the 30 coats of paint. Theirs was the </div><div class="t m5b6 xb h1a y7f3 ff3 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">appearance of holiness.
