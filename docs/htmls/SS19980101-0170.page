The selfish hoarding of the Corinthians </div><div class="t m46b xad hd y83a ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">(1 Cor. 11:21, 22) must cease in the light of two events: Christ&apos;s death </div><div class="t m498 xad hd y83b ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and His coming.

Among the reasons </div><div class="t ma5 x2a hd y842 ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">is a simple one. When Jesus offered the Supper to His disciples in the </div><div class="t m2ed x2a hd y843 ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">upper room, He was physically present with them.
