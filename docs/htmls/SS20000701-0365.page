His wife worked in the office of the </div><div class="t m3f1 x6e h25 y38 ff3 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">commander of the Peruvian police force. The man was an Adventist, </div><div class="t m5dc x6e h25 y426 ff3 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and now his wife was becoming interested in the Adventist church. In </div><div class="t m59f x6e h25 y428 ff3 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">fact, she joined a small group that her boss had started. She talked </div><div class="t m5dd x6e h25 y256 ff3 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">about the singing, fellowship, Bible reading, and prayer time. One day </div><div class="t m1d6 x6e h25 y429 ff3 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Montoya told his wife, &quot;This interest in religion must stop. You must </div><div class="t m5de x6e h25 y258 ff3 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">choose between that small group and me.&quot; </div><div class="t m196 x23 h25 y42b ff3 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">She continued attending the small group meetings in spite of her </div><div class="t m1af x6e h25 y25a ff3 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">husband&apos;s threats. Soon she began rising early on Sabbath mornings </div><div class="t m5df xb h25 y42c ff3 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">while he was still asleep and quietly slipping out to attend the Adventist </div><div class="t m5e0 xb h25 ybe ff3 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">worship services as well. But one Sabbath her husband awoke and </div><div class="t m2c5 xb h25 y25c ff3 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">followed her to church. He was determined to find out what was so </div><div class="t m4e8 xb h25 y418 ff3 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">compelling about the Adventists. Captain Montoya attended the wor-</div><div class="t m5e1 xb h25 y106 ff3 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ship service that day and has not stopped attending since then. He was </div><div class="t m5e2 x6e h25 y49f ff3 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">baptized in 1996. </div><div class="t m5e3 x23 h25 y25e ff3 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Recently I visited Captain Montoya at his police station. I watched </div><div class="t m53a xb h25 y25f ff3 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">as a new shift of officers came on duty. Some 24 officers stood at </div><div class="t m41 xb h25 y42e ff3 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">attention as a short devotional was presented. Then they sang an </div><div class="t m214 xb h25 y260 ff3 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">enthusiastic gospel song. After closing prayer they received their </div><div class="t m5e4 xb h25 y178 ff3 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">orders for the evening. </div><div class="t m9 x23 h25 y248 ff3 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Later Montoya said, &quot;I want my officers to follow the principles of </div><div class="t m5e5 xb h25 y17b ff3 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">God&apos;s Word. None of us receive high salaries. There is always a </div><div class="t m5e6 xb h25 y17c ff3 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">temptation to accept bribes. I tell my officers, &apos;If you take so much as </div><div class="t m5e7 xb h25 y17d ff3 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">one cent, you will lose your job and your soul. It is not worth it.&quot;&apos; </div><div class="t m44f x5d h25 y4a0 ff3 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Six of Captain Montoya&apos;s officers have been baptized in the first </div><div class="t m5e8 xb h25 y111 ff3 fs12 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">two years following his own baptism.
