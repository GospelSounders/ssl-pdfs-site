And that </div><div class="t m9f x13 h1e yac ff6 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">involved a challenge to God&apos;s glory. </div><div class="t ma0 x2a h1e yad ff6 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">There came a day when Moses asked God for a personal revelation of </div><div class="t ma1 x13 h1e yae ff6 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">His glory. And in His response God touched upon the two major </div><div class="t ma2 x13 h1e yaf ff6 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">aspects of His glory: His goodness (Ex. 33:19) and the overwhelming </div><div class="t ma3 x13 h1e yb0 ff6 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">majesty of His Person (verses 20-23). </div><div class="t ma4 x2a h1e yb1 ff6 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">God&apos;s goodness, His character, His selfless love are the foundation </div><div class="t ma5 x13 h1e yb2 ff6 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of His government. The law of His kingdom expresses, in principles that </div><div class="t ma6 x13 h1e yb3 ff6 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">meet our condition, the nature of God&apos;s character. </div><div class="t ma7 x2a h1e yb4 ff6 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">From the few explicit scriptures that speak of Satan&apos;s rebellion and from </div><div class="t ma6 x13 h1e yb5 ff6 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the other few that may make indirect references, we have a picture. </div><div class="t ma8 x2a h1e yb6 ff6 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Satan introduced the spirit of self-exaltation into the universe, and </div><div class="t ma9 x13 h1e yb7 ff6 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">through it he has worked constantly to draw to himself glory and honor. </div><div class="t maa x13 h1e yb8 ff6 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">He wants especially the power and praise side of glory. The spirit of </div><div class="t mab x13 h1e yb9 ff6 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Jesus, by contrast, is the spirit of self-sacrifice. It will be His Spirit, &quot;the </div><div class="t m47 x13 h1e yba ff6 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">glory shining in the face of Jesus,&quot; that will finally prevail. </div><div class="t mac x2a h1e ybb ff6 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">When the great rebellion in heaven was first transferred to this earth, </div><div class="t m47 x13 h1e ybc ff6 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Satan used methods that Christ could not use—lying, deception, immo-</div><div class="t mad x13 h1e ybd ff6 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">rality, false slogans, and exciting suggestions. Many good people are </div><div class="t mae x13 h1e ybe ff6 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">entrapped, often tragically and permanently, by such lures. </div><div class="t maf x2a h1e ybf ff6 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The object of this lesson is to note the method of approach in some of </div><div class="t mb0 x13 h1e yc0 ff6 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Satan&apos;s snares. To show that though worldly honor be lost, all the glory </div><div class="t m47 x13 h1e yc1 ff6 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that endures results from following the Christ road. </div><div class="t mb1 x2a h1e yc2 ff6 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Those who, like the prodigal son, have lost both wealth and the </div><div class="t mb2 x13 h1e yc3 ff6 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">father&apos;s home may find themselves feeding on husks. Fortunately, some </div><div class="t mb3 x13 h1e y70 ff6 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">people do learn from life&apos;s experiences and decide to redeem the time </div><div class="t mb4 x13 h1e yc4 ff6 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">by making good use of the remaining opportunities. Such are likened to </div><div class="t mb5 x13 h1e yc5 ff6 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">brands, plucked from the fire. (Compare Joshua, the high priest—Zech. </div><div class="t mb6 x13 h1e yc6 ff6 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">3:2.) </div><div class="t mb7 x2a h1e yc7 ff6 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Sin has given Satan access to humanity. He claims all, even God&apos;s </div><div class="t mb8 x13 h1e yc8 ff6 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">people, as his own. Because of this fact we are warned that temptations </div><div class="t mb9 x13 h1e yc9 ff6 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">will come to each one of us but that there will be limits to them. With </div><div class="t mba x13 h1e yca ff6 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Christ as our Helper, they will not be greater than we can bear.
