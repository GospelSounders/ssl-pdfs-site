And that </div><div class="t m9f x12 h1a yab ff6 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">involved a challenge to God&apos;s glory. </div><div class="t ma0 x29 h1a yac ff6 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">There came a day when Moses asked God for a personal revelation of </div><div class="t ma1 x12 h1a yad ff6 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">His glory. And in His response God touched upon the two major </div><div class="t ma2 x12 h1a yae ff6 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">aspects of His glory: His goodness (Ex. 33:19) and the overwhelming </div><div class="t ma3 x12 h1a yaf ff6 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">majesty of His Person (verses 20-23). </div><div class="t ma4 x29 h1a yb0 ff6 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">God&apos;s goodness, His character, His selfless love are the foundation </div><div class="t ma5 x12 h1a yb1 ff6 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of His government. The law of His kingdom expresses, in principles that </div><div class="t ma6 x12 h1a yb2 ff6 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">meet our condition, the nature of God&apos;s character. </div><div class="t ma7 x29 h1a yb3 ff6 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">From the few explicit scriptures that speak of Satan&apos;s rebellion and from </div><div class="t ma6 x12 h1a yb4 ff6 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the other few that may make indirect references, we have a picture. </div><div class="t ma8 x29 h1a yb5 ff6 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Satan introduced the spirit of self-exaltation into the universe, and </div><div class="t ma9 x12 h1a yb6 ff6 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">through it he has worked constantly to draw to himself glory and honor. </div><div class="t maa x12 h1a yb7 ff6 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">He wants especially the power and praise side of glory. The spirit of </div><div class="t mab x12 h1a yb8 ff6 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Jesus, by contrast, is the spirit of self-sacrifice. It will be His Spirit, &quot;the </div><div class="t m47 x12 h1a yb9 ff6 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">glory shining in the face of Jesus,&quot; that will finally prevail. </div><div class="t mac x29 h1a yba ff6 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">When the great rebellion in heaven was first transferred to this earth, </div><div class="t m47 x12 h1a ybb ff6 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Satan used methods that Christ could not use—lying, deception, immo-</div><div class="t mad x12 h1a ybc ff6 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">rality, false slogans, and exciting suggestions. Many good people are </div><div class="t mae x12 h1a ybd ff6 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">entrapped, often tragically and permanently, by such lures. </div><div class="t maf x29 h1a ybe ff6 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The object of this lesson is to note the method of approach in some of </div><div class="t mb0 x12 h1a ybf ff6 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Satan&apos;s snares. To show that though worldly honor be lost, all the glory </div><div class="t m47 x12 h1a yc0 ff6 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that endures results from following the Christ road. </div><div class="t mb1 x29 h1a yc1 ff6 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Those who, like the prodigal son, have lost both wealth and the </div><div class="t mb2 x12 h1a yc2 ff6 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">father&apos;s home may find themselves feeding on husks. Fortunately, some </div><div class="t mb3 x12 h1a y6f ff6 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">people do learn from life&apos;s experiences and decide to redeem the time </div><div class="t mb4 x12 h1a yc3 ff6 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">by making good use of the remaining opportunities. Such are likened to </div><div class="t mb5 x12 h1a yc4 ff6 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">brands, plucked from the fire. (Compare Joshua, the high priest—Zech. </div><div class="t mb6 x12 h1a yc5 ff6 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">3:2.) </div><div class="t mb7 x29 h1a yc6 ff6 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Sin has given Satan access to humanity. He claims all, even God&apos;s </div><div class="t mb8 x12 h1a yc7 ff6 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">people, as his own. Because of this fact we are warned that temptations </div><div class="t mb9 x12 h1a yc8 ff6 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">will come to each one of us but that there will be limits to them. With </div><div class="t mba x12 h1a yc9 ff6 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Christ as our Helper, they will not be greater than we can bear. (See </div><div class="t mbb x12 h1a yca ff6 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">1 Cor. 10:13.) </div><div class="t m51 x29 h1a ycb ff6 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The admonition of Jesus is that we &quot;watch and pray&quot; (Matt. 26:41). </div><div class="t mbc x12 h18 ycc ff4 fs11 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">6 </div></div><div class="pi" data-data='{"ctm":[1.000000,0.000000,0.000000,1.000000,0.000000,0.000000]}'></div></div>
