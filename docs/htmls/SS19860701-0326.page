It also is sometimes assumed to be sharing with others the </div><div class="t m3c6 x8 h1e y420 ff5 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">plan of salvation. But again, there is a difference between telling about </div><div class="t m1e7 x8 h1e y421 ff5 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">how Jesus saves us, and letting others see what Jesus has done in us and </div><div class="t m3c7 x44 h1e y422 ff5 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">for us. We come back again to the fact that a witness is someone who </div><div class="t m3c8 x44 h1e y154 ff5 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">testifies about what he knows by personal observation and experience. In </div><div class="t m201 x44 h1e y423 ff5 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">his first epistle, John wrote: &quot;That which was from the beginning, which </div><div class="t m1a9 x44 h1e y157 ff5 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked </div><div class="t m3c9 x8 h1e y371 ff5 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">upon, and our hands have handled, of the Word of life. . . . That which </div><div class="t m30a x44 h1e y213 ff5 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">we have seen and heard declare we unto you&quot; (1 John 1:1, 3). </div><div class="t m391 x71 h3 y424 ff1 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ILLUMINATION: </div><div class="t m3ca x12 h1e y425 ff5 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;As witnesses for Christ, we are to tell what we know, </div><div class="t m31e x44 h1e y426 ff5 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">what we ourselves have seen and heard and felt. If we have been follow-</div><div class="t m3cb x44 h1e y427 ff5 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ing Jesus step by step, we shall have something right to the point to tell </div><div class="t m3cc x44 h1e y428 ff5 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">concerning the way in which He has led us. We can tell how we have </div><div class="t m3cd x44 h1e y429 ff5 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tested His promise, and found the promise true. We can bear witness to </div><div class="t m1e5 x44 h1e y42a ff5 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">what we have known of the grace of Christ.

We learn how to be ready for tough questions in a Bible </div><div class="t m2d6 x71 h1e y440 ff5 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">study. We learn how to overcome objections. We role-play knocking on </div><div class="t m1a1 x71 h1e y441 ff5 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">doors. We memorize key texts and prophetic charts. Giving Bible stud-</div><div class="t m3db x71 h1e y442 ff5 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ies, going house-to-house, distributing literature—all of these things are </div><div class="t me6 x71 h1e y443 ff5 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">important, needed, and vital. They are effective avenues of Christian ser-</div><div class="t m2f9 x71 h1e y444 ff5 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">vice. But no matter how beautiful, needed, and truthful the theory of our </div><div class="t m34a x71 h1e y445 ff5 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">faith is, the most effective way of witnessing is to share what we have </div><div class="t m3dc x71 h1e y446 ff5 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">found in our personal experience with Jesus and have discovered for our-</div><div class="t m3dd x71 h1e y447 ff5 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">selves in His Word.
