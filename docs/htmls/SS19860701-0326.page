It also is sometimes assumed to be sharing with others the </div><div class="t m3c6 x7 h1a y41f ff5 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">plan of salvation. But again, there is a difference between telling about </div><div class="t m1e7 x7 h1a y420 ff5 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">how Jesus saves us, and letting others see what Jesus has done in us and </div><div class="t m3c7 x43 h1a y421 ff5 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">for us. We come back again to the fact that a witness is someone who </div><div class="t m3c8 x43 h1a y153 ff5 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">testifies about what he knows by personal observation and experience. In </div><div class="t m201 x43 h1a y422 ff5 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">his first epistle, John wrote: &quot;That which was from the beginning, which </div><div class="t m1a9 x43 h1a y156 ff5 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked </div><div class="t m3c9 x7 h1a y370 ff5 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">upon, and our hands have handled, of the Word of life. . . . That which </div><div class="t m30a x43 h1a y212 ff5 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">we have seen and heard declare we unto you&quot; (1 John 1:1, 3). </div><div class="t m391 x70 h2 y423 ff1 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ILLUMINATION: </div><div class="t m3ca x11 h1a y424 ff5 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;As witnesses for Christ, we are to tell what we know, </div><div class="t m31e x43 h1a y425 ff5 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">what we ourselves have seen and heard and felt. If we have been follow-</div><div class="t m3cb x43 h1a y426 ff5 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ing Jesus step by step, we shall have something right to the point to tell </div><div class="t m3cc x43 h1a y427 ff5 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">concerning the way in which He has led us. We can tell how we have </div><div class="t m3cd x43 h1a y428 ff5 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tested His promise, and found the promise true. We can bear witness to </div><div class="t m1e5 x43 h1a y429 ff5 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">what we have known of the grace of Christ.

We role-play knocking on </div><div class="t m1a1 x70 h1a y440 ff5 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">doors. We memorize key texts and prophetic charts. Giving Bible stud-</div><div class="t m3db x70 h1a y441 ff5 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ies, going house-to-house, distributing literature—all of these things are </div><div class="t me6 x70 h1a y442 ff5 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">important, needed, and vital. They are effective avenues of Christian ser-</div><div class="t m2f9 x70 h1a y443 ff5 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">vice. But no matter how beautiful, needed, and truthful the theory of our </div><div class="t m34a x70 h1a y444 ff5 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">faith is, the most effective way of witnessing is to share what we have </div><div class="t m3dc x70 h1a y445 ff5 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">found in our personal experience with Jesus and have discovered for our-</div><div class="t m3dd x70 h1a y446 ff5 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">selves in His Word.
