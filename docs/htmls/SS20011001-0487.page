Though we shouldn&apos;t press the </div><div class="t m531 x28 h10 y7f6 ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">analogy too far, there is a parallel: After repeated messages and </div><div class="t m547 x6e h10 y470 ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">plenty of opportunity to repent, judgment is finally rendered. In this </div><div class="t m443 x6e h10 y7f7 ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">case, however, it&apos;s not particularly a favorable judgment. </div><div class="t m473 x6d h10 y7f8 ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The problem, however, with that analogy is that when probation </div><div class="t m389 x6e h10 y7f9 ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">does close, many will have made the right choices, in contrast to what </div><div class="t m6b0 x6e h10 y7fa ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">seems to be happening here in Amos, where it seems almost all the </div><div class="t m2b8 x6e h10 y11 ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">nation is doomed. </div><div class="t m3ff x6d hf y7b7 ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;He that is unjust, let him be unjust still: and he which is filthy, </div><div class="t m12b x19 hf y44e ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">let him be filthy still: and he that is righteous, let him be righteous </div><div class="t m4bd x19 hf y7fb ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">still: and he that is holy, let him be holy still&quot; (Rev. 22:11). There </div><div class="t m6b1 x19 hf y297 ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">are two classes depicted in these texts. Some, clearly, have made </div><div class="t m16 x19 hf y318 ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the right choices; others, just as clearly, haven&apos;t. What makes the </div><div class="t m3a2 x19 hf y18 ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">crucial difference between the two? </div><div class="t m39d x1a h10 y229 ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">It&apos;s very easy to paint a picture of the close of probation in very </div><div class="t ma4 x19 h10 y22a ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">negative terms; and, no doubt, for those who make the wrong choices, </div><div class="t m313 x19 h10 y22b ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">it will be a sad time. Yet we need to understand the close of probation </div><div class="t m407 x19 h10 y22c ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">as the time when many will have made the right choice, a choice that </div><div class="t m152 x19 h10 y22d ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">once and for all will be finalized by God Himself. In a sense, the idea </div><div class="t m2b9 x19 h10 y13e ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of &quot;once-saved-always-saved&quot; becomes true: once probation closes, </div><div class="t mae x19 h10 y27a ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and we have made our choice for Christ—we can never be lost. That </div><div class="t m5b x19 h10 y22f ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">is good news made even better! </div><div class="t m6b2 x1a hf y27c ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Because we can die at any time, and probation does close at </div><div class="t m3e9 x19 hf y27d ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">death, how crucial that we be right with God every day. And what </div><div class="t m11b x77 hf y2b1 ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">is the only way we can be &quot;right with God&quot; at any time? </div><div class="t mb7 x1a h10 y4a7 ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The close of probation must be seen in light of the cross, where </div><div class="t m68a x77 h10 y2c ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Jesus, with His blood, purchased the soul of every human being; </div><div class="t m447 x77 h10 y4a8 ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">otherwise it can be presented very negatively. Sure, it&apos;s a very solemn </div><div class="t m696 x77 h10 y5c5 ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">time, as the eternal destiny of souls is weighed in the balance. Yet we </div><div class="t m162 x77 h10 y101 ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">must remember that God is seeking to bring as many as possible into </div><div class="t m3ff x77 h10 y7fc ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">His eternal kingdom and that through His death Jesus made it possible </div><div class="t m310 x77 h10 y5a8 ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">for everyone, no matter how bad, to have that eternal life. </div><div class="t m3a9 x6c hf y7f3 ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">How do you help someone who&apos;s fearful of the concept of the </div><div class="t m5b x6a hf y5c8 ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">close of probation?
