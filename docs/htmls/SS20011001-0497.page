His arms ached from fatigue, but he dared not stop, lest </div><div class="t mce x63 h22 y2bb ff3 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the current carry him away. Alone and frightened, he searched for a </div><div class="t m4bf x63 h22 y1c5 ff3 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sandbar where he could rest. As he struggled to stay afloat, a sense of </div><div class="t m4b8 x63 h22 y1c6 ff3 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">helplessness swept over him. All he could do was pray. Then his feet </div><div class="t m195 x63 h22 y1c7 ff3 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">touched the gravel edge of the sandbar. He dragged himself out of the </div><div class="t m5a6 x63 h22 y1c8 ff3 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">water and lay on the sand, shivering and utterly exhausted. </div><div class="t m636 x74 h22 y3e ff3 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">When Celedonio&apos;s parents died, he went to live with his brother </div><div class="t m159 x63 h22 y1c9 ff3 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and sister. Two years later his brother died, leaving Celedonio and his </div><div class="t m3b5 x63 h22 y270 ff3 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sister alone. He experienced a series of illnesses that left him weak and </div><div class="t m583 x63 h22 y1ca ff3 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in pain. He prayed to his favorite saint for healing and made promises </div><div class="t m232 x63 h22 y1cb ff3 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and offered sacrifices to her, hoping to receive her blessing. But his </div><div class="t m1fb x63 h22 y50f ff3 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">symptoms did not go away. Still the young man refused to give up. He </div><div class="t m387 x63 h22 y52d ff3 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">began searching for God in other churches, but all the different de-</div><div class="t m393 x63 h22 y510 ff3 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">nominations confused him. </div><div class="t m53 x74 h22 y893 ff3 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Then he met Luis, the pastor of a Protestant church. Luis taught him </div><div class="t md x63 h22 y511 ff3 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">how to pray directly to God in the name of Jesus. When Celedonio </div><div class="t m6a9 x63 h22 y894 ff3 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">prayed as Luis taught him, he began to feel better. </div><div class="t m1d2 x82 h22 y647 ff3 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Luis asked Celedonio to go with him to find work. The two men left </div><div class="t m357 x63 h22 y544 ff3 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">their families behind and traveled to central Bolivia, where they had </div><div class="t m156 x63 h22 y895 ff3 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">heard work was available. They found a job planting crops beside a </div><div class="t m475 x63 h22 y896 ff3 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">wide river. Every evening they crossed the river in a canoe to the town </div><div class="t m1e1 x63 h22 y897 ff3 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">where they stayed. </div><div class="t m356 x82 h22 y898 ff3 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">One evening no canoe came to take them across the river. It was </div><div class="t m288 x63 h22 y899 ff3 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">almost sundown, and the men had to get across before dark. They </div><div class="t md9 x63 h22 y89a ff3 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">surveyed the rain-swollen river and decided they could swim across. </div><div class="t m328 x50 h22 y89b ff3 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">They put their clothes and their valuables into a plastic bag, which </div><div class="t m5f1 x63 h22 y5ea ff3 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Celedonio tied to his waist. Then they jumped into the river. </div><div class="t m558 x82 h22 y3b5 ff3 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Celedonio swam hard against the river&apos;s current. But the plastic bag </div><div class="t m455 x50 h22 y46c ff3 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">dragged in the water, slowing him down. He looked around for Luis, but </div><div class="t m2ce x50 h22 y5f ff3 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">he could not see his friend anywhere. Celedonio feared he would not </div><div class="t m527 x50 h22 y89c ff3 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">make it across the river. Exhausted, he struggled to stay afloat. He found </div><div class="t m668 x50 h22 y89d ff3 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">himself praying, praying for forgiveness, as well as for safety. Suddenly </div><div class="t m3ab x50 h22 y89e ff3 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the current swept the plastic bag containing all of his belongings from </div><div class="t m455 x50 h22 y89f ff3 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">his waist. A sense of helplessness swept over him. Then his feet touched </div><div class="t maa x50 h22 y3dc ff3 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">gravel. He dragged himself onto the sandbar and collapsed, shivering </div><div class="t m42b x50 h22 y14c ff3 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and utterly exhausted. For the moment at least, he was safe. </div><div class="t ma4 x40 h22 y8a0 ff5 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">(Continued next week.) </div><div class="t m5dc x82 h22 y8a1 ff3 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Maria Antonieta de las Muriecas is a Global Mission worker in </div><div class="t m5be x2c h22 y340 ff3 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Portachuela, Bolivia. </div><div class="t m6f9 x27 h22 y720 ff3 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Produced by the Office of Mission </div><div class="t m6fa x29 h22 y829 ff3 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Sabbath Schoolâ€”Personal Ministries Department of the General Conference </div><div class="t m61d xc0 h22 y722 ff3 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Email: gomission@gc.adventist.org </div><div class="t m109 x97 h22 y82a ff3 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0"> </div><div class="t m206 x98 h22 y4fb ff3 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">95 </div></div><div class="pi" data-data='{"ctm":[1.000000,0.000000,0.000000,1.000000,0.000000,0.000000]}'></div></div>
