And the new village church, </div><div class="t m502 x3d h14 y530 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">spawned by the school, is packed every Sabbath. Nearly everyone in </div><div class="t m428 x3d h14 y531 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the village has joined the church. Sanny attends group Bible studies </div><div class="t m503 x3d h14 y532 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">but was not ready to commit his life to God. </div><div class="t m504 x19 h14 y533 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">One Sabbath morning Sanny&apos;s wife and children prepared to go to </div><div class="t m44 x3d h14 y534 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">church. &quot;Go with us, Papa,&quot; they begged. </div><div class="t m505 x2c h14 y535 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;I&apos;ll follow later,&quot; he told them. But he planned to slip away to his </div><div class="t m506 x3d h14 y536 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">garden in the forest instead. </div><div class="t m507 x19 h14 y537 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Sanny&apos;s house stands near the church. He can hear the service from </div><div class="t m508 x3d h14 y538 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">there. </div><div class="t m215 x2d h14 y539 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Shall I attend church or not? </div><div class="t m509 x35 h14 y539 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">he debated. When the singing </div><div class="t m305 x3d h14 y53a ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">stopped, Sanny could hear the voice of a boy preaching. But he </div><div class="t mcf x3d h14 y53b ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">couldn&apos;t understand the words, so he walked to the church and sat </div><div class="t m48a x3d h14 y4a ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">down outside to listen. He still planned to sneak away to his farm. </div><div class="t m50a x19 h14 y53c ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Then Sanny saw three men dressed in white walk up the hill to the </div><div class="t m50b x3d h14 y53d ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">church. Sanny did not recognize them. Two of the men stood outside </div><div class="t m50c x3d h14 y53e ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the church, but the third man walked straight to the pulpit, where the </div><div class="t m50d x18 h14 y53f ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">little boy stood preaching. Suddenly Sanny heard the voice of the child </div><div class="t m50e x18 h14 y540 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">become the voice of the man. </div><div class="t m50d x19 h14 y541 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Sanny hurried to the church door to hear what the stranger said. But </div><div class="t m10e x3d h14 ye0 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the service was ending. </div><div class="t m4a x19 h14 y542 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Welcome,&quot; the members greeted Sanny. But Sanny&apos;s eyes were </div><div class="t m50f x18 h14 y543 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">searching for the man who had walked into the church. </div><div class="t m510 x19 h14 y544 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Where&apos;s the stranger?&quot; Sanny asked. </div><div class="t m4dd x19 h14 y545 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;What stranger?&quot; they questioned. Sanny realized that he was the </div><div class="t m511 x18 h14 y546 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">only one who saw the three men in white. Sanny hurried around the far </div><div class="t m512 x18 h14 y547 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">side of the church and found the three men. &quot;Who are you?&quot; he asked, </div><div class="t m2e3 x18 h14 y548 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">forgetting his manners. </div><div class="t m513 x20 h14 y549 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;It is not time to reveal who we are,&quot; one said. &quot;But we come every </div><div class="t m514 x69 h14 y54a ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">day for village worship, and we especially love to come on Sabbath. </div><div class="t m26 x69 h14 y54b ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Be strong in faith, because the Lord is coming very soon, and those </div><div class="t m463 x69 h14 y54c ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">who are faithful will be saved.&quot; </div><div class="t m515 x20 h14 y54d ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Sanny was struck with fear. &quot;Lord, please forgive me,&quot; he cried, </div><div class="t m516 x69 h14 y54e ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">falling to the ground. But when he looked up, the strangers were gone. </div><div class="t m44e x20 h14 y54f ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Not long after he met the strangers, Sanny was baptized.
