A man, Joao, his wife, Lucilene, and four small children </div><div class="t m35 x20 h26 y358 ff4 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">lived in a scene of intense poverty, hunger, and filth.

A man dressed in white with a Bible in his hand </div><div class="t m2e3 x20 h26 y35d ff4 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">stood beside me. I asked him for directions, and he opened the Bible </div><div class="t m2e4 x20 h26 y35e ff4 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and said: &apos;The way is this one.&apos; &quot; Then Joao added, &quot;God has brought </div><div class="t m2e5 x20 h26 y35f ff4 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">you here.

I located </div><div class="t m2e8 xc h26 y362 ff4 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">them living in a hut made of dirty planks under a tree infested </div><div class="t m2e9 xc h26 y363 ff4 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">with ants.

We taught hygiene and health, and </div><div class="t m2ea xc h26 y366 ff4 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">slowly we were able to change these people&apos;s habits.

But Lucilene was a minor, and they </div><div class="t m2ec xc h26 y369 ff4 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">had not been married, so they had to wait for baptism. </div><div class="t m2ed xb h26 y36a ff4 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">One day Joao called me, very upset.
