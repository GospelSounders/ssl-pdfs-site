A man, Joao, his wife, Lucilene, and four small children </div><div class="t m35 x1f h21 y357 ff4 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">lived in a scene of intense poverty, hunger, and filth. I wondered how </div><div class="t m2df x1f h21 y358 ff4 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the family could focus on studying the Bible when their material </div><div class="t m2e0 x1f h21 y359 ff4 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">needs were so great, but Joao eagerly told me about a dream he had. </div><div class="t mca x1f h21 y35a ff4 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;I was going to a dance, but I came to a crossroad, and </div><div class="t m2e1 x7f h26 y35a ff3 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I </div><div class="t m2e2 x80 h21 y35a ff4 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">did not know </div><div class="t m2be x1f h21 y35b ff4 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">which way to go. A man dressed in white with a Bible in his hand </div><div class="t m2e3 x1f h21 y35c ff4 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">stood beside me. I asked him for directions, and he opened the Bible </div><div class="t m2e4 x1f h21 y35d ff4 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and said: &apos;The way is this one.&apos; &quot; Then Joao added, &quot;God has brought </div><div class="t m2e5 x1f h21 y35e ff4 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">you here. Yes, we want to study the Bible.&quot; </div><div class="t m2e6 xa h21 y35f ff4 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I went to visit the family several Sabbaths in a row but did not </div><div class="t m2e7 xb h21 y360 ff4 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">find them home. Then I learned that they had moved. I located </div><div class="t m2e8 xb h21 y361 ff4 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">them living in a hut made of dirty planks under a tree infested </div><div class="t m2e9 xb h21 y362 ff4 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">with ants. Their month-old baby&apos;s body was covered with ant </div><div class="t m2e6 xb h21 y363 ff4 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">bites. Because of their need, some church members and I began a </div><div class="t m1bf xb h21 y364 ff4 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Branch Sabbath School there. We taught hygiene and health, and </div><div class="t m2ea xb h21 y365 ff4 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">slowly we were able to change these people&apos;s habits. Commu-</div><div class="t m44 xb h21 y366 ff4 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">nity Services helped with clothing and shoes, and soon Joao and </div><div class="t m2eb xb h21 y367 ff4 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Lucilene asked for baptism. But Lucilene was a minor, and they </div><div class="t m2ec xb h21 y368 ff4 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">had not been married, so they had to wait for baptism. </div><div class="t m2ed xa h21 y369 ff4 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">One day Joao called me, very upset. I went to see them and </div><div class="t m218 xb h21 y36a ff4 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">found that Lucilene had been beaten by the neighbors. Joao was </div><div class="t m183 xb h21 y36b ff4 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">so angry he wanted to kill the offenders. Weeping with them, </div><div class="t m2ee x81 h26 y36b ff3 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I </div><div class="t m2ef xb h21 y36c ff4 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">opened the Bible to Romans 12:19-21 and read, &quot;Do not take </div><div class="t m2f0 xb h21 y36d ff4 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">revenge, . . . but leave room for God&apos;s wrath, for it is written: &apos;It </div><div class="t m2f1 xb h21 y36e ff4 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">is mine to avenge; I will repay,&apos; says the Lord. . . . Do not be </div><div class="t m2ea xb h21 y36f ff4 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.&quot; Slowly Joao </div><div class="t m2f2 x54 h21 y370 ff4 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">calmed down. </div><div class="t m2f3 x30 h21 y371 ff4 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">We prayed and asked God to help them find another home. </div><div class="t m284 x54 h21 y372 ff4 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">When I returned home, I met a friend who needed someone to </div><div class="t m80 x54 h21 y373 ff4 fs13 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">live on an unoccupied ranch he owned.
