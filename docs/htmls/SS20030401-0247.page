Zachary </div><div class="t m35f x4f h14 y3c ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The two young men sat in a New York factory classroom waiting </div><div class="t m488 x52 h14 y4ae ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">for their new job orientation to begin. Ivan introduced himself to Luis </div><div class="t m489 x52 h14 y4af ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and began telling some off-color jokes. But Ivan noticed that Luis did </div><div class="t m48a x52 h14 y4b0 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">not respond to the jokes as most men do. </div><div class="t m46c x2c h14 y4b1 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Ivan watched Luis during class. He was different—kind, thought-</div><div class="t m48b x52 h14 y4b2 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ful, patient, and seemed to enjoyed helping others. </div><div class="t m3f4 x2c h14 y4b3 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">As the newness of the job wore off, Ivan felt depression settling </div><div class="t m48c x52 h14 y4b4 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">over him. One day in the factory cafeteria, Ivan saw Luis sitting in a </div><div class="t m48d x52 h14 y4b5 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">corner by himself. </div><div class="t m457 x17 h14 y4b6 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">He must be depressed too, </div><div class="t m165 x39 h14 y4b6 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Ivan thought. As he </div><div class="t m48e x52 h14 y4b7 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">approached, he saw that Luis was not depressed; he looked peaceful, </div><div class="t m48f x52 h14 y4b8 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">even joyful. </div><div class="t m490 x7 h14 y4b8 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I&apos;ve never met anyone like Luis in my life, </div><div class="t m2ed x51 h14 y4b9 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Ivan thought. </div><div class="t m491 x2c h14 y4ba ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Hey man, are you religious?&quot; Ivan finally asked. </div><div class="t m492 x2c h14 y4bb ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Yes, I am,&quot; Luis replied. </div><div class="t m493 x2c h14 y4bc ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">During his teen years, Ivan had spent many hours reading the Bible. </div><div class="t m494 x3d h14 y4bd ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">But some things he read did not agree with the teachings of his priest, </div><div class="t m495 x52 h14 y4be ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">such as the Sabbath. </div><div class="t m496 x3e h14 y4be ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Jesus had kept the Sabbath, </div><div class="t m497 xa0 h14 y4be ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Ivan thought. </div><div class="t m498 xa3 h14 y4be ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Why </div><div class="t m5c x52 h14 y4bf ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">don&apos;t Christians? </div><div class="t m499 xab h14 y4bf ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Then there were other questions. </div><div class="t m49a x2c h14 y4c0 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Ivan began asking Luis questions about the Bible, and Luis always </div><div class="t m21f x3d h14 y4c1 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">answered them. Luis&apos;s answers made so much sense. Finally Ivan </div><div class="t m44 x3d h14 y398 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">asked, &quot;Hey man, what church do you attend?&quot; </div><div class="t m49b x20 h14 y4c2 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;I am a Seventh-day Adventist,&quot; Luis answered. Ivan had never </div><div class="t m47d x3d h14 y4c3 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">heard of that church. Luis explained. &quot;The Sabbath of the Bible is </div><div class="t m49c x3d h14 y4c4 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Saturday, the day that Jesus kept all of His life on earth.&quot; </div><div class="t m49d x2c h14 y4c5 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;That answers one of my biggest questions!&quot; Ivan said with excite-</div><div class="t m49e x3d h14 y4c6 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ment. &quot;Ever since I was a kid, I thought that was what the Bible taught.&quot; </div><div class="t m35c x2c h14 y4c7 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Ivan, you would enjoy listening to a pastor who is speaking in </div><div class="t m49f x3d h14 y4c8 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">town,&quot; Luis offered. Their friendship made it easy for Luis to agree to </div><div class="t m4a0 x3d h14 y4c9 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">attend a Protestant church for the first time. </div><div class="t m3f3 x19 h14 y4ca ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Ivan was deeply impressed. Everything the preacher said </div><div class="t m3c3 x2a h40 y4ca ff3 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was </div><div class="t ma x3d h14 y1c9 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">founded on the Bible. Ivan took home the sermon review sheet </div><div class="t m4a1 x5 h40 y1c9 ff3 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and </div><div class="t m4a2 x3d h14 y2be ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">carefully studied each text. </div><div class="t m2f9 x25 h14 y2be ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">This preacher is right and follows the </div><div class="t m4a3 x3d h14 y4cb ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Bible, </div><div class="t m4a4 x2d h14 y4cb ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Ivan told himself. </div><div class="t m4a5 x19 h14 y4cc ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">During the meetings Ivan saw that he was a sinner, and he cried out </div><div class="t m4a6 x3d h14 y4cd ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to Jesus to save him. Ivan continued taking Bible studies and was </div><div class="t m4a7 x18 h14 y4ce ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">baptized several months after the meetings ended. &quot;I want to live a life </div><div class="t m4a8 x3d h14 y4cf ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">as close to Jesus as </div><div class="t m4a9 x27 h40 y4cf ff3 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I </div><div class="t m240 x75 h14 y4d0 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">can,&quot; Ivan testifies.
