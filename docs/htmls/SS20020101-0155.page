She had seen a wide road filled with people. Nearby was a </div><div class="t m53 x17 h15 y5c8 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">narrow road on which only a few people traveled. </div><div class="t m51e x5 h15 y5c8 ff4 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">What could it mean, </div><div class="t m14b x17 h15 y5c9 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">she wondered. </div><div class="t m51f x2a h15 y5ca ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">A few months later Alice had another dream. In it she approached a </div><div class="t m520 x17 h15 y5cb ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">village, and a man invited her to enter. As they walked through the </div><div class="t m65 x17 h15 y5cc ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">village, she smelled burning meat. As she left the village, the man told </div><div class="t m266 x17 h15 y5cd ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">her, &quot;Think about what you have seen here.&quot; </div><div class="t m3d x2a h15 y5ce ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The next morning Alice told her family about the dream, hoping </div><div class="t m16e x17 h15 y5cf ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">they could help her understand its meaning. She knew that the meats </div><div class="t m1e5 x17 h15 y5d0 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">she had smelled were unclean, and that Adventists do not eat them. </div><div class="t m146 x17 h15 y5d1 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">But she was not an Adventist. In fact, she often fought against the </div><div class="t m180 x17 h15 y48 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Adventists in her village. </div><div class="t m521 x2a h15 y5d2 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">A few months later Alice and her family moved to the district capital, </div><div class="t m32c x17 h15 y5d3 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">where she would teach school. She met Adventist missionaries Jeff and </div><div class="t m159 x17 h15 y5d4 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Bobbi Bishop. The two families became friends. One day Jeff Bishop </div><div class="t m522 x17 h15 y5d5 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">saw Alice sitting alone in her classroom, and he stopped to talk. </div><div class="t m458 x2a h15 y5d6 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;I was listening to the radio the other day,&quot; Alice said. &quot;The </div><div class="t m235 x17 h15 y5d7 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">announcer offered a book that sounded interesting.
