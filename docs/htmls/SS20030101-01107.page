In a few simple words, he expresses </div><div class="t m6fa x42 h9 ya5f ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">what should be one of the great advantages we, as covenant </div><div class="t m1ba x42 h9 ya60 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">people, have—and that is the promise of joy. </div><div class="t m28f x48 h9 ya61 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">As Christians, we are often told not to go by feeling, that faith is not </div><div class="t m4ee x5d h9 ya62 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">feeling, and that we need to get beyond our feelings, all of which is true. </div><div class="t m16c x5d h9 ya63 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">But at the same time, we would not be human beings if we were not </div><div class="t m183 x5d h9 y424 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">creatures of feelings, emotions, and moods. We cannot deny our feel-</div><div class="t m399 x5d h9 y25f ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ings; what we need to do is understand them, give them their proper </div><div class="t m7f x5d h9 y260 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">role, and, as much as possible, keep them under control. But to deny </div><div class="t m6b x5d h9 ya64 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">them is to deny what it means to be human (we might as well tell a circle </div><div class="t m4c2 x12 h9 ya65 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">not to be round). Indeed, as this verse says, not only should we have </div><div class="t m1b3 x12 h9 ya66 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">feelings (in this case joy) but they should be full. It hardly sounds as if </div><div class="t m754 x12 h9 ya67 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">feelings are to be denied, does it? </div><div class="t m52f x48 hf ya68 ff7 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Read the context of the above verse, starting at the beginning of the </div><div class="t m146 x12 hf ya69 ff7 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">chapter. What was John writing to the early Christians that he hoped </div><div class="t m13f x12 hf ya6a ff7 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">would make their joy full? And why should it give them joy? </div><div class="t m292 x48 h9 y4f ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">John was one of the original Twelve. He was there, almost from </div><div class="t m755 x12 h9 ya6b ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the start of Christ&apos;s three-and-a-half-year ministry, a witness to </div><div class="t m408 x12 h9 yb7 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">some of the most amazing things of Jesus (he was there at the Cross, </div><div class="t m5e0 x49 h9 ya6c ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">at Gethsemane, and at the Transfiguration, as well). Thus, as an </div><div class="t m756 x49 h9 yb9 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">eyewitness, he was certainly well-qualified to talk about this subject. </div><div class="t m549 x11 h9 ya6d ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Yet, notice, too, that the emphasis is not on himself; it is on what </div><div class="t m5da x49 h9 ybb ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Jesus had done for the disciples so they can now have fellowship not </div><div class="t mb5 x49 h9 ybc ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">only with each other but with God Himself. Jesus has opened the way </div><div class="t m33e x49 h9 ybd ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">for us to enter into this close relationship with the Lord; and, one result </div><div class="t m237 x49 h9 ya6e ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of this fellowship—this relationship—is joy. John wants them to know </div><div class="t m28d x49 h9 ybf ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that what they have heard about Jesus is true (he saw, touched, felt, </div><div class="t m373 x49 h9 yc0 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and heard Him), and thus they, too, can enter into a joyful relationship </div><div class="t m1da x49 h9 yc1 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">with their heavenly Father, who loves them and gave Himself through </div><div class="t mc3 x49 h9 yc2 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">His Son for them. </div><div class="t m2ab x90 hf ya6f ff7 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">In a certain sense, John is giving his own personal testimony. </div><div class="t m4c6 xa hf ya70 ff7 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">What is your testimony regarding your relationship with Jesus? </div><div class="t m218 xa hf ya71 ff7 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">What could you </div><div class="t m376 xa9 h9 ya71 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">say </div><div class="t m40a x17 hf ya71 ff7 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that could help increase someone&apos;s joy in the </div><div class="t m2a8 x6a hf ya72 ff7 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Lord, as John sought to do here? </div><div class="t m2c9 xe h9 y355 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">105 </div></div><div class="pi" data-data='{"ctm":[1.000000,0.000000,0.000000,1.000000,0.000000,0.000000]}'></div></div>
