In a few simple words, he expresses </div><div class="t m6fa x43 hb ya60 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">what should be one of the great advantages we, as covenant </div><div class="t m1ba x43 hb ya61 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">people, have—and that is the promise of joy. </div><div class="t m28f x49 hb ya62 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">As Christians, we are often told not to go by feeling, that faith is not </div><div class="t m4ee x5e hb ya63 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">feeling, and that we need to get beyond our feelings, all of which is true. </div><div class="t m16c x5e hb ya64 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">But at the same time, we would not be human beings if we were not </div><div class="t m183 x5e hb y425 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">creatures of feelings, emotions, and moods. We cannot deny our feel-</div><div class="t m399 x5e hb y260 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ings; what we need to do is understand them, give them their proper </div><div class="t m7f x5e hb y261 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">role, and, as much as possible, keep them under control. But to deny </div><div class="t m6b x5e hb ya65 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">them is to deny what it means to be human (we might as well tell a circle </div><div class="t m4c2 x13 hb ya66 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">not to be round). Indeed, as this verse says, not only should we have </div><div class="t m1b3 x13 hb ya67 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">feelings (in this case joy) but they should be full. It hardly sounds as if </div><div class="t m754 x13 hb ya68 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">feelings are to be denied, does it? </div><div class="t m52f x49 h11 ya69 ff7 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Read the context of the above verse, starting at the beginning of the </div><div class="t m146 x13 h11 ya6a ff7 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">chapter. What was John writing to the early Christians that he hoped </div><div class="t m13f x13 h11 ya6b ff7 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">would make their joy full? And why should it give them joy? </div><div class="t m292 x49 hb y50 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">John was one of the original Twelve. He was there, almost from </div><div class="t m755 x13 hb ya6c ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the start of Christ&apos;s three-and-a-half-year ministry, a witness to </div><div class="t m408 x13 hb yb8 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">some of the most amazing things of Jesus (he was there at the Cross, </div><div class="t m5e0 x4a hb ya6d ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">at Gethsemane, and at the Transfiguration, as well). Thus, as an </div><div class="t m756 x4a hb yba ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">eyewitness, he was certainly well-qualified to talk about this subject. </div><div class="t m549 x12 hb ya6e ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Yet, notice, too, that the emphasis is not on himself; it is on what </div><div class="t m5da x4a hb ybc ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Jesus had done for the disciples so they can now have fellowship not </div><div class="t mb5 x4a hb ybd ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">only with each other but with God Himself. Jesus has opened the way </div><div class="t m33e x4a hb ybe ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">for us to enter into this close relationship with the Lord; and, one result </div><div class="t m237 x4a hb ya6f ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of this fellowship—this relationship—is joy. John wants them to know </div><div class="t m28d x4a hb yc0 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that what they have heard about Jesus is true (he saw, touched, felt, </div><div class="t m373 x4a hb yc1 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and heard Him), and thus they, too, can enter into a joyful relationship </div><div class="t m1da x4a hb yc2 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">with their heavenly Father, who loves them and gave Himself through </div><div class="t mc3 x4a hb yc3 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">His Son for them. </div><div class="t m2ab x91 h11 ya70 ff7 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">In a certain sense, John is giving his own personal testimony. </div><div class="t m4c6 xb h11 ya71 ff7 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">What is your testimony regarding your relationship with Jesus? </div><div class="t m218 xb h11 ya72 ff7 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">What could you </div><div class="t m376 xaa hb ya72 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">say </div><div class="t m40a x18 h11 ya72 ff7 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that could help increase someone&apos;s joy in the </div><div class="t m2a8 x6b h11 ya73 ff7 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Lord, as John sought to do here? </div><div class="t m2c9 xf hb y356 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">105 </div></div><div class="pi" data-data='{"ctm":[1.000000,0.000000,0.000000,1.000000,0.000000,0.000000]}'></div></div>
