Christianity, in practice, is a new relationship between a sinful </div><div class="t m8f x39 h11 y84 ff6 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">person and the God.who created and sustains him. Jesus Christ is the direct link </div><div class="t m90 x39 h11 y85 ff6 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">between God and man, by His incarnation. He also became the Substitute </div><div class="t m91 x39 h11 y86 ff6 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and Surety (Pledge, Guarantee) for the sinful race. </div><div class="t m92 x3a h11 y87 ff6 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Sinful men may enter a new-covenant relationship with God by faith in the </div><div class="t m93 x39 h11 y88 ff6 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Substitute and by continual cooperation with the Surety. Christ takes our sins </div><div class="t m94 x39 h11 y4d ff6 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and gives us His righteousness. We receive it in two ways. In Him we are </div><div class="t m95 x39 h11 y89 ff6 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">accounted righteous and remain so as long as we maintain our absolute depen-</div><div class="t m96 x39 h11 y8a ff6 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">dence upon Him and His merits. He also enters into a living relationship with us </div><div class="t m97 x39 h11 y8b ff6 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">whereby the Holy Spirit brings about a new-birth experience in our hearts and </div><div class="t m98 x39 h11 y8c ff6 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">minds and writes the laws of God, as the inward law, upon the fleshy tables of our </div><div class="t m1 x39 h11 y8d ff6 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">hearts. (See Heb. 10:16.) From and by this inward law all of life is shaped for the </div><div class="t m99 x39 h11 y8e ff6 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">believer. He wills to work out what God puts within. </div><div class="t m9a x3a h11 y8f ff6 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">In our lessons of this quarter we will concentrate upon the inward law and its </div><div class="t m9b x39 h11 y90 ff6 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">outworking in our individual lives. But it is vital that we recognize throughout </div><div class="t m9c x39 h11 y91 ff6 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">this study that the outworking of the inward law does nothing toward earning our </div><div class="t m9d x39 h11 y92 ff6 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">salvation. There is no question of deserving salvation. </div><div class="t m9e xe h11 y93 ff6 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Our acceptance with God is already secure in Jesus Christ. &quot;Ye are complete </div><div class="t m9f x39 h11 y94 ff6 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in Him&quot; (Col. 2:10). What the Father thinks of Christ makes us acceptable, in </div><div class="t ma0 x39 h11 y95 ff6 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Him, to God. Let us remember that this law is implanted in the heart by God </div><div class="t ma1 x39 h11 y96 ff6 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">when we accept &quot;Jesus only&quot; as our righteousness. By the power of the Holy </div><div class="t ma2 x39 h11 y97 ff6 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Spirit, bringing resurrection power into our lives—the same power within Him-</div><div class="t ma3 x39 h11 y98 ff6 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">self by which Jesus rose from the dead—the inward law becomes the motivation </div><div class="t ma4 x39 h11 y99 ff6 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and the direction of our lives. In essence it is the implanting of the Ten Com-</div><div class="t ma5 x39 h11 y9a ff6 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">mandments in the wellsprings of our thoughts and actions. </div><div class="t ma6 x3a h11 y9b ff6 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">That Ten Commandment law is the expression of the character of God in </div><div class="t ma7 x39 h11 y9c ff6 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">human terms fitting our human situation. Hence it is the law of love, for God is </div><div class="t ma8 x39 h11 y29 ff6 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">love. This law of love is likewise the law of life—the life of God in us. So we blend </div><div class="t ma9 x39 h11 y9d ff6 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the three elements in the title of the lessons of this quarter—Law, Love, and </div><div class="t maa x39 h11 y9e ff6 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Life. Our Saviour becomes the pledge of the fulfillment of all three in our </div><div class="t mab x39 h11 y9f ff6 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">standing with God and in our daily experience with God and man. </div><div class="t mac x3a h11 ya0 ff6 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Basic to human nature and universal in its application is God&apos;s law of love, </div><div class="t mad x39 h11 ya1 ff6 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">which transcends all cultures, customs, socioeconomic classes, ages, races, </div><div class="t mae x39 h11 ya2 ff6 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">nationalities, time, and geographical locations. It makes Christianity a religion, </div><div class="t maf x39 h11 ya3 ff6 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">not of the East or of the West, but of the whole world. A believer from any nation </div><div class="t mb0 x39 h11 ya4 ff6 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">does have to accept Jesus Christ as his Saviour and open his heart to the Holy </div><div class="t mb1 x39 h11 ya5 ff6 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Spirit. </div><div class="t mb2 x3b h11 ya6 ff6 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">From the individual and human viewpoint there can be no objective values </div><div class="t mb3 x39 h11 ya7 ff6 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">despite the claims of moral philosophers.

But if the standard of goodness is given by God, who is </div><div class="t mb6 x39 h11 ya9 ff6 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">absolutely objective, then the establishment of a universally objective law is not </div><div class="t mb7 x39 h11 yaa ff6 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">only possible but sure. </div><div class="t mb8 x3a h11 yab ff6 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Man&apos;s law is enforced by government officers. Sentence passed on the con-</div><div class="t mb9 x34 h11 yac ff6 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">victed is frequently based upon incomplete evidence. But God&apos;s law is enforced </div><div class="t m95 x34 h11 yad ff6 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">by (1) man&apos;s own conscience, (2) by God&apos;s direct, redeeming intervention, and </div><div class="t mba x39 h11 yae ff6 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">(3) by natural events following the laws of cause and effect.
