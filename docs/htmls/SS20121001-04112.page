He was single and </div><div class="t m0 x39 h5 yb03 ff14 fs4 fc3 sc0 ls2 ws6">lived with his mother. A Seventh-day Adventist friend often talked about </div><div class="t m0 x39 h5 yb04 ff14 fs4 fc3 sc0 ls2 ws6b">the Bible. As Moïse began to understand the importance of the Sabbath, </div><div class="t m0 x39 h5 yb05 ff14 fs4 fc3 sc0 ls2 ws6">he quit driving his taxi on Saturdays.  </div><div class="t m0 x42 h5 yb06 ff14 fs4 fc3 sc0 ls2 ws1d">Moïse’s Aunt Paulette saw Moïse’s interest in God and invited him to </div><div class="t m0 x39 h5 yb07 ff14 fs4 fc3 sc0 ls2 wsb8">church and evangelistic meetings, sitting with him to help him to find the </div><div class="t m0 x39 h5 yb08 ff14 fs4 fc3 sc0 ls2 ws6">Bible texts. Moïse gave his life to Christ.</div><div class="t m0 x42 h5 yb09 ff14 fs4 fc3 sc0 ls2 wsc3">“Nonsense,” Moïse’s mother said when she learned her son wanted to </div><div class="t m0 x39 h5 yb0a ff14 fs4 fc3 sc0 ls2 ws67">become a Seventh-day Adventist. But he was determined. When he was </div><div class="t m0 x39 h5 yb0b ff14 fs4 fc3 sc0 ls2 ws115">baptized, his mother ordered him to leave her house. Moïse moved out, </div><div class="t m0 x39 h5 yb0c ff14 fs4 fc3 sc0 ls2 ws6">gave up driving a taxi, and became a literature evangelist. </div><div class="t m0 x42 h5 yb0d ff14 fs4 fc3 sc0 ls2 ws41">His passion to share God’s literature with others was contagious. When </div><div class="t m0 x39 h5 yb0e ff14 fs4 fc3 sc0 ls2 ws2e">his mother saw how God was changing his life, she began attending the </div><div class="t m0 x39 h5 yb0f ff14 fs4 fc3 sc0 ls2 ws6">Seventh-day Adventist Church. She has since been baptized. </div><div class="t m0 x42 h5 yb10 ff14 fs4 fc3 sc0 ls2 ws8c">Moïse was sent to another town to hold evangelistic meetings. There </div><div class="t m0 x39 h5 yb11 ff14 fs4 fc3 sc0 ls2 ws93">eight people took their stand for Christ. Church members urged him to </div><div class="t m0 x39 h5 yb12 ff14 fs4 fc3 sc0 ls2 ws39">prepare for the ministry. <span class="ff13">What greater joy can there be than to win souls </span></div><div class="t m0 x39 h5 yb13 ff13 fs4 fc3 sc0 ls2 ws6">to Christ?<span class="ff14"> Moïse thought. He prayed about it, and the call grew stronger. </span></div><div class="t m0 x42 h5 yb14 ff14 fs4 fc3 sc0 ls2 ws4a">One day Moïse received a text message from Marlyce, a school friend </div><div class="t m0 x39 h5 yb15 ff14 fs4 fc3 sc0 ls2 ws9c">who was facing school exams. As Moïse prayed for her, he felt impressed </div><div class="t m0 x39 h5 yb16 ff14 fs4 fc3 sc0 ls2 wsb8">that one day they would marry. He told the pastor, who urged him to sur<span class="ws3">-</span></div><div class="t m0 x39 h5 yb17 ff14 fs4 fc3 sc0 ls2 ws6">render the future to God.</div><div class="t m0 x42 h5 yb18 ff14 fs4 fc3 sc0 ls2 ws145">Marlyce lived far away, so the two talked and prayed by telephone. </div><div class="t m0 x39 h5 yb19 ff14 fs4 fc3 sc0 ls2 ws7e">Moïse was concerned that Marlyce might not want to be a pastor’s wife. </div><div class="t m0 x39 h5 yb1a ff14 fs4 fc3 sc0 ls2 ws145">But before he could ask her, Marlyce told him that she felt he should </div><div class="t m0 x39 h5 yb1b ff14 fs4 fc3 sc0 ls2 ws3">become a pastor. The two knew then that God had brought them together. </div><div class="t m0 x39 h5 yb1c ff14 fs4 fc3 sc0 ls2 ws6">A few months later they were married. </div><div class="t m0 x42 h5 yb1d ff14 fs4 fc3 sc0 ls2 ws58">But other obstacles stood in their path. Marlyce was teaching school </div><div class="t m0 x39 h5 yb1e ff14 fs4 fc3 sc0 ls9 ws87">five hours from Cosendai Adventist University, where Moïse would study. </div><div class="t m0 x39 h5 yb1f ff14 fs4 fc3 sc0 ls2 ws2f">But God had prepared a place for them. Moïse’s in-laws moved to the </div><div class="t m0 x39 h5 yb20 ff14 fs4 fc3 sc0 ls2 ws6">town near the university. He could live with them while he studied. </div><div class="t m0 x42 h5 yb21 ff14 fs4 fc3 sc0 ls2 wsf8">During vacations Moïse and Marlyce canvass and give Bible studies </div><div class="t m0 x39 h5 yb22 ff14 fs4 fc3 sc0 ls2 ws52">together. The money Moïse earns from colporteuring helps to pay his </div><div class="t m0 x39 h5 yb23 ff14 fs4 fc3 sc0 ls2 wsb0">school fees. “I’m convinced that this is God’s plan for us,” Moïse says. </div><div class="t m0 x39 h5 yb24 ff14 fs4 fc3 sc0 ls2 ws6">“It won’t be easy, but with God all things are possible.” </div><div class="t m0 x42 h5 yb25 ff14 fs4 fc3 sc0 ls2 ws21">Our mission offerings support evangelism and education in Cameroon </div><div class="t m0 x39 h5 yb26 ff14 fs4 fc3 sc0 ls2 wsc9">and around the world.
