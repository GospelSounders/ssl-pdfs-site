We see Christianity as it grows, thrives, and spreads. </div><div class="t mbb x41 hb yba ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">We see the gospel making inroads into one of the great cities of the </div><div class="t mbc x41 hb y5 ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ancient world. In 1 Corinthians, Paul tries to equip early Christian </div><div class="t mbd x41 hb ybb ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">disciples to live the gospel in the sophisticated culture of Corinth. </div><div class="t m6a x17 hb ybc ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">He longs for his correspondents to establish a firm self-identity as </div><div class="t mbe x41 hb ybd ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Christians, one that will stand the onslaught of social pressure. </div><div class="t mbf x49 hb ybe ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">As we study 2 Corinthians this quarter, we see also Paul&apos;s rea-</div><div class="t mc0 x17 hb ybf ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">soned arguments and enthusiasm for the gospel. All these things are </div><div class="t mc1 x17 hb yc0 ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">present in his Second Epistle to the Corinthians. But we also find </div><div class="t mc2 x17 hb yc1 ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">something more. We find what is perhaps Paul&apos;s most personal </div><div class="t mc3 x17 hb y64 ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">letter. Here we see him not only courageous and triumphant but </div><div class="t mc4 x17 hb yc2 ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">deeply concerned and personally threatened. In 1 Corinthians we </div><div class="t mc5 x17 hb yc3 ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">learn about conditions in Corinth; in 2 Corinthians we learn about </div><div class="t mc6 x17 hb yc4 ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">conditions in Paul. </div><div class="t mc7 x4a hb yc5 ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">While reading this letter, it is tempting to feel disconnected from </div><div class="t mc8 x17 hb yc6 ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">it. After all, Paul&apos;s disagreements with the Corinthians and discus-</div><div class="t mc9 x17 hb yc7 ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sions about the legitimacy of his apostleship are hardly front-page </div><div class="t mca x17 hb yc8 ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">news today. </div><div class="t mcb x4a hb yc9 ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">On second thought, though, the letter is all about ministry.
