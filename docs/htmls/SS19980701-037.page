We see Christianity as it grows, thrives, and spreads. </div><div class="t mbb x42 hd ybb ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">We see the gospel making inroads into one of the great cities of the </div><div class="t mbc x42 hd y6 ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ancient world. In 1 Corinthians, Paul tries to equip early Christian </div><div class="t mbd x42 hd ybc ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">disciples to live the gospel in the sophisticated culture of Corinth. </div><div class="t m6a x18 hd ybd ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">He longs for his correspondents to establish a firm self-identity as </div><div class="t mbe x42 hd ybe ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Christians, one that will stand the onslaught of social pressure. </div><div class="t mbf x4a hd ybf ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">As we study 2 Corinthians this quarter, we see also Paul&apos;s rea-</div><div class="t mc0 x18 hd yc0 ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">soned arguments and enthusiasm for the gospel. All these things are </div><div class="t mc1 x18 hd yc1 ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">present in his Second Epistle to the Corinthians. But we also find </div><div class="t mc2 x18 hd yc2 ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">something more. We find what is perhaps Paul&apos;s most personal </div><div class="t mc3 x18 hd y65 ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">letter. Here we see him not only courageous and triumphant but </div><div class="t mc4 x18 hd yc3 ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">deeply concerned and personally threatened. In 1 Corinthians we </div><div class="t mc5 x18 hd yc4 ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">learn about conditions in Corinth; in 2 Corinthians we learn about </div><div class="t mc6 x18 hd yc5 ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">conditions in Paul. </div><div class="t mc7 x4b hd yc6 ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">While reading this letter, it is tempting to feel disconnected from </div><div class="t mc8 x18 hd yc7 ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">it. After all, Paul&apos;s disagreements with the Corinthians and discus-</div><div class="t mc9 x18 hd yc8 ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sions about the legitimacy of his apostleship are hardly front-page </div><div class="t mca x18 hd yc9 ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">news today. </div><div class="t mcb x4b hd yca ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">On second thought, though, the letter is all about ministry. And if </div><div class="t mcc x18 hd ycb ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">we as Seventh-day Adventists are to fulfill the commission to take </div><div class="t mcd x18 hd ycc ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;this gospel of the kingdom&quot; into &quot;all the world,&quot; we surely need to </div><div class="t mce x18 hd ycd ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">study it with care. </div><div class="t mcf x4b hd yce ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">From Paul&apos;s experiences as he records them in his second letter to </div><div class="t md0 x18 hd ycf ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the church in Corinth, we may learn the following about how to </div><div class="t ma4 x18 hd yd0 ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">improve each of our own personal ministries: </div><div class="t md1 x2b hd yd1 ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">1. </div><div class="t md2 x4a hd yd1 ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">What it means to minister on Christ&apos;s behalf; </div><div class="t md3 x18 hd yd2 ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">2. </div><div class="t md4 x4b hd yd3 ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">How to create a personal ministry based on the Cross of Christ </div><div class="t md5 x4a hd yd4 ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and His resurrection; </div><div class="t md6 x2b hd yd5 ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">3. </div><div class="t md7 x4a hd yd5 ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">What the true qualities of an effective ministry are; and </div><div class="t md8 x2b hd yd6 ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">4. </div><div class="t md9 x4a hd yd7 ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">How our weaknesses can become the genius of our ministry. </div><div class="t mda x2e hd yd8 ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">To outline 2 Corinthians in such a way may seem to miss much of </div><div class="t mdb x2b hd yd9 ff3 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the excitement that pulses through its pages.
