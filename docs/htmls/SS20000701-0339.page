He stopped to listen, and someone invited </div><div class="t m15f x6d hc y66 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">him in. The building was an Adventist church. </div><div class="t mac x22 hc y67 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Someone gave Pan a hymnal, and that gift changed his life. Pan </div><div class="t m3db x6d hc y68 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">taught himself to read so he could learn the hymns. When he found a </div><div class="t m2e4 x6d hc y69 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">word he didn&apos;t know he circled it and later asked someone what the </div><div class="t m447 x6d hc y6a ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">word meant. Pan literally sang himself into the Adventist Church. </div><div class="t m448 x22 hc y6b ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">One day Pan was so engrossed in a gospel tract that he forgot about </div><div class="t m449 x6d hc y41 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the sheep. When he looked up the sheep were gone! Pan began </div><div class="t m44a x6d hc y443 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">searching for the sheep. The sky grew dark with rain clouds, and still </div><div class="t m44b xa hc y8e ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Pan had not found the sheep. </div><div class="t m44c x50 hc y8e ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">How could I let my sheep wander away? </div><div class="t m2a4 xa hc y8f ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">he chastened himself. </div><div class="t m2e5 x22 hc y90 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Then Pan remembered that God knows everything. He knelt and </div><div class="t m44d xa hc y91 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">prayed, &quot;Lord, have mercy on me. Help me find my sheep.&quot; When he </div><div class="t m1c8 xa hc y19 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">opened his eyes the dark clouds had gone and he was surrounded by </div><div class="t m247 xa hc y93 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">his flock of sheep. Not one was missing! Pan returned to the village </div><div class="t m44d xa hc y444 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and eagerly told others what had happened. </div><div class="t m44e x5c hc y95 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Pan&apos;s faith in God grew, and he was baptized. He loved to share his </div><div class="t m44f xa hc y96 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">faith with others, and the Adventist church encouraged him to study </div><div class="t m450 xa hc y445 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">theology and become a pastor. But Pan ran into difficulties at the </div><div class="t m451 xa hc y98 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">government-operated seminary. Students teased him about worshiping </div><div class="t m1d7 xa hc y446 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">on the Sabbath and refusing to eat pork. Teachers often gave tests on </div><div class="t m452 xa hc y447 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Sabbath, and Pan&apos;s Sabbath absences from class eventually led to his </div><div class="t m70 xa hc y9b ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">dismissal. But God provided a way for him to continue attending </div><div class="t m453 xa hc yc9 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">classes. He never received a diploma for his work at the seminary, but </div><div class="t m454 xa hc y9d ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Pan knew that Jesus&apos; disciples had no diplomas either. </div><div class="t m382 x5c hc y448 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Pan returned to his mountain home and started preaching. He </div><div class="t m455 xa hc y9e ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">established many house churches among the Miao villages. Hundreds </div><div class="t m456 xa hc y449 ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">have been baptized because of his witness. Attendance at Adventist </div><div class="t m457 xa hc y44a ff2 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">churches in his village has grown to more than 1,200.
