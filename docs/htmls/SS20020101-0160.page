Of course, we never see the actual battle between </div><div class="t mff x54 he y3c2 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">them itself; we see it, instead, in various secondary manifestations, </div><div class="t mfd x7a he y35a ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">such as what happens even in our own hearts. </div><div class="t m403 x4c he y15 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">In the temptation of Jesus in the wilderness, however, we see the </div><div class="t m56b x7a he y5b2 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">great controversy between Christ and Satan literally, in the purest </div><div class="t m3f1 x54 he y3c3 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">form—Christ against Satan, Satan against Christ, no proxies in-</div><div class="t m4b6 x54 he y5b4 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">volved. Here, some of the fundamental issues in the great controversy </div><div class="t md5 x7a he y2d3 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">are played out in about as clear a manner as possible. No symbols, no </div><div class="t m374 x54 he y5b6 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">hidden codes to interpret, no guess as to who is on which side. What </div><div class="t m1b1 x7a he y22b ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">we are privileged to see is the essence of the great controversy, Christ </div><div class="t m512 x7a he y3c6 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">against Satan, period. </div><div class="t m56c x4c hd yfd ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Notice what Satan says to Christ in Matthew 4:3: &quot; &apos;If you are the </div><div class="t mcd x7a hd y5b8 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">son of God&apos; &quot; (NIV).

Ellen White says that he </div><div class="t m218 x7a he y325 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">appeared as an angel of light; his purpose was, of course, to try and </div><div class="t me4 x7a he y326 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">trick Jesus, just as he tried, and succeeded, to trick Eve in Eden. In </div><div class="t m43f x7a he ybf ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">other words, Satan did not attempt to use violence or force against </div><div class="t m36b x7a he yc0 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Christ. He didn&apos;t threaten Him with violence, jail, or anything that </div><div class="t m56f x7a he yc1 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">could have given him or his purposes away. Instead, he worked </div><div class="t m570 x7a he y328 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">subtly, smoothly, even quoting Scripture in response to Christ&apos;s </div><div class="t m571 x7a he y329 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">quoting Scripture, though Satan purposely twisted the Word. He </div><div class="t m420 x7a he y32a ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">quoted a divine promise from Psalm 91:11, 12 and challenged Christ </div><div class="t me6 x7a he y32b ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to rely on that promise (Matt. 4:5-7).
