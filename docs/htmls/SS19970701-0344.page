While the </div><div class="t m499 x8 h16 y610 ff3 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">mustard seed was not technically the smallest of seeds, it was noted </div><div class="t m448 x49 h16 y611 ff3 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">for its minuteness.

Or if they were discussing a minuscule infraction of the </div><div class="t m3b7 x49 h16 ya5 ff3 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ceremonial law, the rabbis would talk about it in terms of the </div><div class="t m32e x8 h16 y613 ff3 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">smallness of the mustard seed. Thus it was not unusual for Jesus </div><div class="t m1ba x8 h16 y614 ff3 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Himself to refer to it. </div><div class="t m1a9 x4a h16 y615 ff3 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Women often used the black mustard to cook with.

And when the seeds matured, </div><div class="t m49a x8 h16 y617 ff3 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">they would grind them for use as a dressing or flavoring. They also </div><div class="t m49b x8 h16 y618 ff3 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">mixed the seeds in a plaster used to relieve pain.
