His greatest </div><div class="t m72e x2f h35 y9b2 ff4 fs26 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">pleasure after becoming drunk was to ring the church bell in the Orthodox </div><div class="t m5b8 x30 h35 y9b3 ff4 fs26 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">church towerâ€”at one or two in the morning. The community, believing </div><div class="t m8db x2f h35 y9b4 ff4 fs26 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the bell should be rung at night only if there was an emergency, was </div><div class="t m65e x30 h35 y9b5 ff4 fs26 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">angry and asked Stephen&apos;s father to curb his son. </div><div class="t m6c0 x1 h35 y5bb ff4 fs26 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Tell me what you want me to buy you so you won&apos;t ring the </div><div class="t m297 x30 h35 y9b6 ff4 fs26 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">bell,&quot; Stephen&apos;s father asked him. &quot;A bicycle,&quot; responded Stephen.

This time </div><div class="t m40 x2f h35 y9b7 ff4 fs26 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the humiliated father bought him a German MZ 12.5 CC motorcycle. For </div><div class="t m7ac x2f h35 y459 ff4 fs26 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">several nights the bell didn&apos;t ring. Then early one dark morning everyone </div><div class="t m6e5 x2f h35 y9b8 ff4 fs26 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was again awakened by the tolling of the bell.

Stephen decided to </div><div class="t m431 x2f h35 y9ba ff4 fs26 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">have some fun by asking some questions he was sure the pastor couldn&apos;t </div><div class="t m3f4 x2f h35 y45d ff4 fs26 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">answer. The pastor firmly told him he would finish his study on Daniel </div><div class="t m8dc x2f h35 y45e ff4 fs26 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">2 before answering his questions. Impressed with history, Stephen </div><div class="t m284 x2f h35 y5ca ff4 fs26 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">enjoyed the study! </div><div class="t m178 x68 h35 y5cb ff4 fs26 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Stephen attended each Bible lesson, and on the nights of the </div><div class="t m4eb x2f h35 y5cc ff4 fs26 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Bible study, the community noticed the church bell was silent.
