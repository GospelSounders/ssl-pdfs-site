These proud, nomadic herdsmen </div><div class="t m347 x6 hd y364 ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of the African plains, dressed in their traditional </div><div class="t m348 x70 hd y364 ff7 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">kangas </div><div class="t m1ae x5c hd y364 ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">(cloth </div><div class="t m349 x6 hd y365 ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">wraps) and wool blankets, have stubbornly resisted Western influ-</div><div class="t m81 x6 hd y366 ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ence, including Christianity. As Jan learned more about the Masai, </div><div class="t md3 x6 hd y367 ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">a desire grew to work with these people. </div><div class="t m84 x5 hd y368 ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Jan visited a Masai home outside Nairobi. She greeted her </div><div class="t m1d6 x6 hd y369 ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Masai hostess then ducked her head to enter the tiny hut made of </div><div class="t m34a x6 hd y36a ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">thin sticks covered with cow dung. The entire Masai home would </div><div class="t m344 x6 hd y36b ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">have fit into her livingroom! Two beds made of cow hides stretched </div><div class="t mbd xa8 hd y36c ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">over rough frames, hugged opposite walls.

As the woman swished out the </div><div class="t m322 xa8 hd y370 ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">cups with not-so-clean water, Jan prayed, &quot;Father, keep a smile on </div><div class="t m34d xa8 hd y105 ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">my face and the tea in my stomach!&quot; God answered her prayer, and </div><div class="t m34e xa8 hd y371 ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">gave Jan a growing love for these simple people of the plains. </div><div class="t m1bc x35 hd y372 ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Later, at a Masai feast, the missionaries photographed their </div><div class="t m34f xa8 hd y74 ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Masai hosts as they performed traditional dances. But Jan did not </div><div class="t m32b xa8 hd y373 ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">just want to watch; she wanted to experience their culture. Bravely </div><div class="t m327 xa8 hd y374 ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">she asked if they would teach her one of their dances.
