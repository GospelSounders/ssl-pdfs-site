He had </div><div class="t m5ad x78 h12 y676 ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">spent some time teaching the people in one village about God. The </div><div class="t m192 x78 h12 y677 ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">people listened, but they did not respond to his invitation to trust </div><div class="t m5ae x1a h12 y678 ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Christ. Takila decided to visit another village. He asked for directions </div><div class="t m4fd x1a h12 y679 ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to the next village and was told it was not far. By midday he began </div><div class="t m5af x78 h12 y3b ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">walking toward the next village. </div><div class="t m5b0 x1b h12 y4ba ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Takila did not know it, but the people in the village planned to test </div><div class="t m5b1 x78 h12 y4bb ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">him to see if what he had told them was true. They asked the witch </div><div class="t m5b2 x78 h12 y67a ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">doctor to call on the lions of the savannah to test Takila&apos;s honesty. </div><div class="t m1d0 x29 h12 y67b ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Takila walked all afternoon toward the next village. As the sun </div><div class="t m195 x78 h12 y67c ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">slipped behind the distant hills, Takila realized that the village was </div><div class="t m5b3 x78 h12 y67d ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">farther than he thought. Darkness set in, but Takila had no place to </div><div class="t m583 x78 h12 y67e ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">spend the night. In the distance Takila could see lights moving. He </div><div class="t m2f0 x78 h12 y67f ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">realized the lights were the glow of lions&apos; eyes. </div><div class="t m5b4 x29 h12 y680 ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Takila pleaded with God to protect him from the hungry lions. As </div><div class="t m47d x78 h12 y4c3 ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">he walked he realized that the lions were walking the same direction, </div><div class="t m1e7 x78 h12 y681 ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">but they did not come near him. When he stopped to rest, the lions </div><div class="t m1a x78 h12 y682 ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">stopped. Takila&apos;s fear drained away as he realized that God had sent </div><div class="t m5b5 x78 h12 y683 ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the lions to protect him. </div><div class="t m5b6 x29 h12 y684 ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Dawn revealed a village in the distance. Takila hurried toward it. </div><div class="t m5b7 x29 h12 y685 ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The villagers were surprised to see a stranger approach and asked </div><div class="t m5b8 x7c h12 y686 ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">him where he had come from. When he told them, they shouted, &quot;That </div><div class="t m410 x7c h12 y687 ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">is impossible! The lions of the savannah would have killed you.&quot; </div><div class="t m312 x29 h12 y688 ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Takila looked toward the savannah, but the lions were gone. Then </div><div class="t m5b9 x7c h12 y4cc ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">he told the gathering crowd that the God whom he serves had sent the </div><div class="t m4c0 x7c h12 y54 ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">lions to protect him and keep him company during the long walk. </div><div class="t m5ba x70 h12 y689 ff3 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Word spread fast about the man who walked with lions.
