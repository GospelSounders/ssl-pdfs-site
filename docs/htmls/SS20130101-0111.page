More specifically, Jesus is the One through whom all things </div><div class="t m0 x45 h36 y167 ff12 fs3 fc3 sc0 ls2 ws94">were created. In John’s day, the term <span class="ff11 ws5">logos</span> was commonly used </div><div class="t m0 x45 h36 y168 ff12 fs3 fc3 sc0 ls2 ws95">to represent the creative principle. John’s early readers would be </div><div class="t m0 x45 h36 y169 ff12 fs3 fc3 sc0 ls2 ws6">familiar with the concept of <span class="ff11 ws5">logos</span> as a creative principle or even as a </div><div class="t m0 x45 h36 y16a ff12 fs3 fc3 sc0 ls2 ws81">creator. John applied this familiar concept to Jesus, identifying Him as </div><div class="t m0 x45 h36 y16b ff12 fs3 fc3 sc0 ls2 ws96">the true Creator.

This means that we could read Genesis 1:1 </div><div class="t m0 x45 h36 y16e ff12 fs3 fc3 sc0 ls2 ws6">as “In the beginning, Jesus created the heavens and the earth.” </div><div class="t m0 x58 h36 y16f ff12 fs3 fc3 sc0 ls2 ws98">Paul’s words in Colossians 1 resonate with those of John in the </div><div class="t m0 x45 h36 y170 ff12 fs3 fc3 sc0 ls2 ws55">identification of the Creator as Jesus Christ.

First, He is the image </div><div class="t m0 x45 h36 y172 ff12 fs3 fc3 sc0 ls2 ws70">of the invisible God. In our sinful state, we cannot see God the Father, </div><div class="t m0 x45 h36 y173 ff12 fs3 fc3 sc0 ls2 ws9a">but we can see Jesus.
