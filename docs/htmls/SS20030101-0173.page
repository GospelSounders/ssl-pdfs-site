H. Zachary </div><div class="t m600 x90 h36 y7e5 ff4 fs1c fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Pun grew up in a village in Myanmar (Burma) where villagers </div><div class="t m47d x6a h36 y860 ff4 fs1c fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">followed the traditional beliefs of their ancestors. The villagers </div><div class="t m631 x6a h36 y861 ff4 fs1c fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">worshiped the gods of the forest, the storm, the rocks, and the </div><div class="t m632 x6a h36 y862 ff4 fs1c fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">mountains. They lived in fear of curses that might be cast upon </div><div class="t m633 x6a h36 y863 ff4 fs1c fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">them by their enemies. </div><div class="t m242 x90 h36 y864 ff4 fs1c fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">While still a young boy, Pun began attending a Branch Sabbath </div><div class="t m5e0 x6a h36 y865 ff4 fs1c fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">School. He earned small gifts for memorizing Bible verses. Al-</div><div class="t m634 x6a h36 y866 ff4 fs1c fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">though he did not understand what the verses meant, he was </div><div class="t m635 x6a h36 y867 ff4 fs1c fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">storing God&apos;s Word in his mind. </div><div class="t m2b4 x90 h36 y868 ff4 fs1c fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Pun saw that the Christians enjoyed a peace and lack of fear of </div><div class="t m636 x6a h36 y869 ff4 fs1c fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the spirits that the other villagers did not have. Pun came to feel </div><div class="t m310 x6a h36 y86a ff4 fs1c fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">more and more at home with the Christians. He enjoyed the songs </div><div class="t m60e x6a h36 y86b ff4 fs1c fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">he learned. When the pastor asked Pun if he would like to know </div><div class="t m637 x6a h36 y86c ff4 fs1c fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">more about the Bible, Pun joined the baptismal class. </div><div class="t m638 x16 h36 y86d ff4 fs1c fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Other villagers shunned him, and even his parents were un-</div><div class="t md8 x6a h36 y86e ff4 fs1c fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">happy with his interest in Christianity. But over the years, Pun&apos;s </div><div class="t m4a7 x6a h36 y86f ff4 fs1c fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">family saw the changes in his life, and, eventually, the rest of the </div><div class="t m490 x15 h36 y870 ff4 fs1c fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">family became Adventist Christians. </div><div class="t m58b x16 h36 y871 ff4 fs1c fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">When Pun completed high school, he wanted to continue his </div><div class="t m1fa x15 h36 y872 ff4 fs1c fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">education. But his father had no way to earn the tuition. They lived </div><div class="t m4a9 x15 h36 y873 ff4 fs1c fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">on what Father could find in the jungle. </div><div class="t m5fd x16 h36 y874 ff4 fs1c fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Pun traveled to Malaysia to live and work with his brother. </div><div class="t m639 x15 h36 y875 ff4 fs1c fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Although they worked hard, they made barely enough to care for </div><div class="t m63a x15 h36 y876 ff4 fs1c fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">themselves. For four years Pun fasted and prayed that God would </div><div class="t m63b x15 h36 y877 ff4 fs1c fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">help him go to college. Then one Sabbath a foreigner visited Pun&apos;s </div><div class="t m63c x15 h36 y878 ff4 fs1c fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">church. He and Pun became good friends over the next few weeks, </div><div class="t m63d x15 h36 y879 ff4 fs1c fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and before the visitor left for home, he asked Pun, &quot;How would </div><div class="t m59f x15 h36 y87a ff4 fs1c fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">you like to go to Mountain View College, in the Philippines?&quot; </div><div class="t m63e x16 h36 y87b ff4 fs1c fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Sir,&quot; Pun replied, &quot;I have been fasting and praying for four </div><div class="t m3c1 x15 h36 y87c ff4 fs1c fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">years to go to college.&quot; </div><div class="t m63f x16 h36 y87d ff4 fs1c fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Perhaps this is the answer to your prayer, Pun,&quot; his friend </div><div class="t m640 x70 h36 y87e ff4 fs1c fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">replied.
