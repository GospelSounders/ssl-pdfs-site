H. Zachary </div><div class="t m600 x91 h3a y7e6 ff4 fs1c fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Pun grew up in a village in Myanmar (Burma) where villagers </div><div class="t m47d x6b h3a y861 ff4 fs1c fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">followed the traditional beliefs of their ancestors. The villagers </div><div class="t m631 x6b h3a y862 ff4 fs1c fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">worshiped the gods of the forest, the storm, the rocks, and the </div><div class="t m632 x6b h3a y863 ff4 fs1c fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">mountains. They lived in fear of curses that might be cast upon </div><div class="t m633 x6b h3a y864 ff4 fs1c fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">them by their enemies. </div><div class="t m242 x91 h3a y865 ff4 fs1c fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">While still a young boy, Pun began attending a Branch Sabbath </div><div class="t m5e0 x6b h3a y866 ff4 fs1c fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">School. He earned small gifts for memorizing Bible verses. Al-</div><div class="t m634 x6b h3a y867 ff4 fs1c fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">though he did not understand what the verses meant, he was </div><div class="t m635 x6b h3a y868 ff4 fs1c fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">storing God&apos;s Word in his mind. </div><div class="t m2b4 x91 h3a y869 ff4 fs1c fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Pun saw that the Christians enjoyed a peace and lack of fear of </div><div class="t m636 x6b h3a y86a ff4 fs1c fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the spirits that the other villagers did not have. Pun came to feel </div><div class="t m310 x6b h3a y86b ff4 fs1c fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">more and more at home with the Christians. He enjoyed the songs </div><div class="t m60e x6b h3a y86c ff4 fs1c fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">he learned. When the pastor asked Pun if he would like to know </div><div class="t m637 x6b h3a y86d ff4 fs1c fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">more about the Bible, Pun joined the baptismal class. </div><div class="t m638 x17 h3a y86e ff4 fs1c fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Other villagers shunned him, and even his parents were un-</div><div class="t md8 x6b h3a y86f ff4 fs1c fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">happy with his interest in Christianity. But over the years, Pun&apos;s </div><div class="t m4a7 x6b h3a y870 ff4 fs1c fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">family saw the changes in his life, and, eventually, the rest of the </div><div class="t m490 x16 h3a y871 ff4 fs1c fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">family became Adventist Christians. </div><div class="t m58b x17 h3a y872 ff4 fs1c fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">When Pun completed high school, he wanted to continue his </div><div class="t m1fa x16 h3a y873 ff4 fs1c fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">education. But his father had no way to earn the tuition. They lived </div><div class="t m4a9 x16 h3a y874 ff4 fs1c fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">on what Father could find in the jungle. </div><div class="t m5fd x17 h3a y875 ff4 fs1c fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Pun traveled to Malaysia to live and work with his brother. </div><div class="t m639 x16 h3a y876 ff4 fs1c fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Although they worked hard, they made barely enough to care for </div><div class="t m63a x16 h3a y877 ff4 fs1c fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">themselves. For four years Pun fasted and prayed that God would </div><div class="t m63b x16 h3a y878 ff4 fs1c fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">help him go to college. Then one Sabbath a foreigner visited Pun&apos;s </div><div class="t m63c x16 h3a y879 ff4 fs1c fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">church. He and Pun became good friends over the next few weeks, </div><div class="t m63d x16 h3a y87a ff4 fs1c fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and before the visitor left for home, he asked Pun, &quot;How would </div><div class="t m59f x16 h3a y87b ff4 fs1c fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">you like to go to Mountain View College, in the Philippines?&quot; </div><div class="t m63e x17 h3a y87c ff4 fs1c fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Sir,&quot; Pun replied, &quot;I have been fasting and praying for four </div><div class="t m3c1 x16 h3a y87d ff4 fs1c fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">years to go to college.&quot; </div><div class="t m63f x17 h3a y87e ff4 fs1c fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Perhaps this is the answer to your prayer, Pun,&quot; his friend </div><div class="t m640 x71 h3a y87f ff4 fs1c fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">replied.
