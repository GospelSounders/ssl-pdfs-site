Tragically and incredibly, Adam and Eve yielded to Satan&apos;s </div><div class="t m4d x16 h1e y749 ff5 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">temptation. In mercy God spared their lives so that they might have opportu-</div><div class="t m460 x16 h1e y74a ff5 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">nity to repent, but the penalty for breaking God&apos;s law had to be met. Thus </div><div class="t mc1 x16 h1e y74b ff5 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">God offered His own Son to come to this earth and die, taking the place of </div><div class="t m31c x16 h1e y74c ff5 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sinners. </div><div class="t m22d x19 h1d y74d ff6 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">What happy ending did God promise to the continuing conflict be-</div><div class="t m415 x16 h1d y74e ff6 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tween good and evil? Gen. 3:15. </div><div class="t m3d4 x19 h1e y74f ff5 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">As time passed, the effects of sin became more and more evident, not </div><div class="t m43d x16 h1e y750 ff5 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">only in the human race but in all of nature. The principles advocated by </div><div class="t m13d x16 h1e y751 ff5 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Satan, at first but dimly seen as dangerous, bore a harvest of evil fruit. </div><div class="t m525 x16 h1e y752 ff5 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Nineteen centuries ago, when Satan inspired human beings to murder Jesus, </div><div class="t m329 x16 h1e y753 ff5 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the beings in other worlds saw clearly that God was right and Satan was </div><div class="t m2d9 x16 h1e y754 ff5 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">wrong. The inhabitants of heaven and the unfallen worlds saw that God is </div><div class="t m1f6 x16 h1e y755 ff5 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">love and that His law is just and necessary. But to give the inhabitants of our </div><div class="t m8 x16 h1e y756 ff5 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">world ample opportunity to understand the issues in the great controversy </div><div class="t m526 x16 h1e y757 ff5 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">between Christ and Satan and to choose whose side they wanted to join, God </div><div class="t m249 x16 h1e y758 ff5 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">permitted the sin drama to continue. </div><div class="t m4ed x19 h1e y759 ff5 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Today the conflict is nearing its close. With great urgency the Holy Spirit </div><div class="t m32d x16 h1e y1b8 ff5 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and the angels of heaven are seeking to help people choose God&apos;s sideâ€”</div><div class="t m4c9 x16 h1e y75a ff5 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">even to put loyalty to God, righteousness, and truth above life itself. The </div><div class="t m139 x16 h1e y75b ff5 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Bible makes it clear that the ultimate outcome will be complete victory for </div><div class="t m527 x16 h1e y75c ff5 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">God and the vindication of His character and law. Until that day of victory, </div><div class="t m62 x16 h1e y1bd ff5 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">good and evil will continue side by side.

THE BIBLE&apos;S COSMIC WORLD VIEW </div><div class="t m331 x19 h1e y760 ff5 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Chronologically the first book of the Bible is Job, not Genesis. Whereas </div><div class="t m310 x16 h1e y761 ff5 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Genesis is Planet-Earth centered, introducing us to the creation of the world </div><div class="t m37 x16 h1e y762 ff5 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and everything in it, the book of Job is cosmic-centered. It is concerned with </div><div class="t m528 x16 h1e y763 ff5 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the universe as a whole. Already in the sixth verse of the first chapter it soars </div><div class="t m529 x16 h1e y764 ff5 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">beyond Planet Earth to a cosmic united nations. &quot;Now there was a day when </div><div class="t mc7 x16 h1e y765 ff5 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord, and Satan also </div><div class="t m3e5 x16 h1e y766 ff5 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">came among them. The Lord said to Satan, &apos;Whence have you come?&apos; Satan </div><div class="t m3f0 x16 h1e y767 ff5 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">answered the Lord, &apos;From going to and fro on the earth, and from walking </div><div class="t m1ab x16 h1e y768 ff5 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">up and down on it&apos; &quot; (Job 1:6, 7, RSV). These &quot;sons of God&quot; apparently </div><div class="t m52a x16 h1e y769 ff5 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">were leaders from other inhabited worlds. Satan appeared as the usurper </div><div class="t m249 x16 h1e y76a ff5 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">leader of Planet Earth. </div><div class="t m20e x19 h1d y76b ff6 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">What did Christ have to say to Satan about Job? Job 1:8-12; 2:1-7. </div><div class="t m4c0 x19 h1e y76c ff5 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">With the cosmic conflict in mind, Christ said: &quot;Satan, look at Job. He </div><div class="t m44c x16 h1e y660 ff5 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">keeps my law. He is perfect!&quot; To which Satan countered, &quot;Yes, but he&apos;s </div><div class="t m259 x16 h1e y76d ff5 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">perfect because it pays to serve you. Don&apos;t you protect him?&quot; (See Job 1:9, </div><div class="t m292 x16 h1e y76e ff5 fsf fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">10.)
