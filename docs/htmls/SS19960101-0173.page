For all these years I was nothing </div><div class="t m5ef x2e h11 y9cc ff2 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">more than a secular humanist. But during the last few months a </div><div class="t mcd x2e h11 y9cd ff2 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">whole new joyous life has opened to me. </div><div class="t mf0 x91 h11 y9ce ff2 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">My dear friend Brenda suffered from a terminal illness, and I </div><div class="t m579 x2e h11 y9cf ff2 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">spent a lot of time with her. For almost four months a group of </div><div class="t m14b x2e h11 y9d0 ff2 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">kind people who didn&apos;t even know Brenda brought meals to her </div><div class="t m5f9 x2e h11 y36 ff2 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">home every day. I noticed something different about these people. </div><div class="t m22a x2e h11 y9d1 ff2 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">They lived like real Christians. Brenda&apos;s husband, Nick, services </div><div class="t m435 x2e h11 y9d2 ff2 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">computers, and one of his clients is the General Conference of-</div><div class="t m5fa x2e h11 y9d3 ff2 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">fices. As Nick became acquainted with some workers at the church&apos;s </div><div class="t m5fb x2e h11 y39 ff2 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">headquarters, he told them about Brenda&apos;s illness, and those people </div><div class="t m48a x2e h11 y9d4 ff2 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">began praying with him. Some of them began bringing food by for </div><div class="t m51 x2e h11 y9d5 ff2 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the family. Nick started studying the Bible with them, searching </div><div class="t m2f7 x2e h11 y9d6 ff2 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">for answers to his deepest questions. </div><div class="t md4 x8 h11 y9d7 ff2 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">After Brenda&apos;s death I continued to visit Nick and his daughter </div><div class="t m5fc x4 h11 y9d8 ff2 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Doreen to help them through their grief. Sometimes we had strong </div><div class="t m1d3 x2e h11 y3d ff2 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">discussions about religion. One day Nick challenged me, &quot;Have </div><div class="t mfb x4 h11 y9d9 ff2 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">you ever read the Bible?&quot; I accepted Nick&apos;s challenge and started </div><div class="t m3bf x4 h11 y9da ff2 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">reading the Bible. Then Nick loaned me a book on Daniel. The </div><div class="t m342 x4 h11 y9db ff2 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Bible became real to me. I read the Christian literature hungrily. </div><div class="t m13f x8 h11 y9dc ff2 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Nick invited me to one of the Bible studies at his house. I went, </div><div class="t m5fd x4 h11 y9dd ff2 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">but I resisted some ideas and had lots of questions about what we </div><div class="t mc4 x4 h11 y9de ff2 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">were studying. Through it all Dr. Erwin Gane, the teacher, was so </div><div class="t m5fe x4 h11 y9df ff2 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">patient and accepting. I kept coming. For most of my life I seemed </div><div class="t m202 x4 h11 y9e0 ff2 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to be looking into a mirror of self reliance; now I seemed to be </div><div class="t m5ff x4 h11 y9e1 ff2 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">climbing a ladder, reaching out to Jesus. </div><div class="t m146 x8 h11 y48 ff2 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Finally I surrendered my life to Jesus and was baptized.
