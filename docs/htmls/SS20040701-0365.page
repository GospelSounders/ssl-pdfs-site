When two Adventist pilots flew </div><div class="t m12d x83 h6 y454 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">into an isolated village in the highlands of PNG, they discovered almost </div><div class="t m2cf x83 h6 y6ad ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the entire village burned to the ground. Slowly they pieced together the </div><div class="t m2bd x83 h6 y6ae ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">story. </div><div class="t m385 x4b h6 y457 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">About two weeks earlier two friends from the village had gone to Port </div><div class="t m2d6 xe h6 y6af ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Moresby, the major city on the southern coast. One man had two bananas, </div><div class="t m38e xe h6 y6b0 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">but the other man had brought nothing to eat. In the morning Friend A </div><div class="t m2e7 xe h6 y6b1 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">awoke to discover one of his bananas was missing. Friend B denied hav-</div><div class="t m24f xe h6 y6b2 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ing taken the banana, but Friend A was not convinced. In his mind he </div><div class="t m293 xe h6 y6b3 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">vowed that he would get revenge for the stolen banana. </div><div class="t m1ee x4b h6 y6b4 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The night that the two men returned to their village, Friend A sneaked </div><div class="t m26a xe h6 y6b5 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">out and set Friend B&apos;s hut on fire. The grass-mat sides and grass roof </div><div class="t m58b xe h6 y6b6 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">erupted into a ball of flame and burned to the ground in minutes. </div><div class="t m36e xe h6 y2fe ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Thankfully, no one was killed. But Friend B knew who had done this and </div><div class="t m328 xe h6 y6b7 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">he vowed revenge. </div><div class="t m215 x4b h6 y45d ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The next night Friend B set Friend A&apos;s hut afire. Friend A called his clan </div><div class="t m1e7 xe h6 y301 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">members together, and that night they set fire to all the huts that belonged </div><div class="t m234 xe h6 y45f ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to Friend B&apos;s clan. In turn, Friend B and his clan set fire to clan A&apos;s huts. </div><div class="t m58c xe h6 y6b8 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The remaining villagers could not stand to watch the excitement, so they </div><div class="t ma4 xe h6 y460 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">took sides.

The raging villagers stopped in </div><div class="t m58d x1 h6 y30b ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">their tracks. &quot;God is watching out for His church!&quot; they cried. &quot;Which one </div><div class="t m1e0 x1 h6 y6b9 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of us would dare set fire to God&apos;s church?&quot; </div><div class="t m13d x2c h6 ye6 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">And so, if you fly into that village today, you will see our lone little </div><div class="t m58e x1 h6 y30d ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Adventist church standing amidst a burned-out village.
