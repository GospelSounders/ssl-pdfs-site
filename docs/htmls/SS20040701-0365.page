When two Adventist pilots flew </div><div class="t m12d x84 h8 y455 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">into an isolated village in the highlands of PNG, they discovered almost </div><div class="t m2cf x84 h8 y6ae ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the entire village burned to the ground.

One man had two bananas, </div><div class="t m38e xf h8 y6b1 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">but the other man had brought nothing to eat.

Friend B denied hav-</div><div class="t m24f xf h8 y6b3 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ing taken the banana, but Friend A was not convinced. In his mind he </div><div class="t m293 xf h8 y6b4 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">vowed that he would get revenge for the stolen banana. </div><div class="t m1ee x4c h8 y6b5 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The night that the two men returned to their village, Friend A sneaked </div><div class="t m26a xf h8 y6b6 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">out and set Friend B&apos;s hut on fire. The grass-mat sides and grass roof </div><div class="t m58b xf h8 y6b7 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">erupted into a ball of flame and burned to the ground in minutes. </div><div class="t m36e xf h8 y2ff ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Thankfully, no one was killed.

Friend A called his clan </div><div class="t m1e7 xf h8 y302 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">members together, and that night they set fire to all the huts that belonged </div><div class="t m234 xf h8 y460 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to Friend B&apos;s clan. In turn, Friend B and his clan set fire to clan A&apos;s huts. </div><div class="t m58c xf h8 y6b9 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The remaining villagers could not stand to watch the excitement, so they </div><div class="t ma4 xf h8 y461 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">took sides.
