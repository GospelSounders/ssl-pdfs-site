Nana made it a point to answer all </div><div class="t m2bf x3a h14 y756 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">religious questions from the Bible. </div><div class="t m666 x4f h14 y757 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The group studied many topics, including the Second Coming and </div><div class="t m667 x3a h14 y758 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">prophecies of Daniel and Revelation. When a student asked a question </div><div class="t m3f4 x3a h14 y759 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">on Daniel 7:25 regarding changing the law of God, Nana could not </div><div class="t m5b8 x3a h14 ya7 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">answer without talking about the Sabbath. After the meeting, several </div><div class="t m2d5 x3a h14 y42 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">students wanted to know more about the Sabbath and how to keep it. </div><div class="t m308 x4f h14 y4e1 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Nana asked for and was eventually given permission to take her </div><div class="t m668 x52 h14 y75a ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Bible study students off campus to attend Sabbath services in a nearby </div><div class="t m1db x3a h14 y75b ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">town. After the visit, however, the school president reprimanded her </div><div class="t m669 x52 h14 y75c ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">for teaching the students her own beliefs and undermining the school&apos;s </div><div class="t m2de x52 h14 y75d ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">religious teachings.

The students were told that the Bible study group was disbanded </div><div class="t m57c x52 h14 y760 ff2 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and that Nana could no longer study or pray with them.
