He joined a charismatic group, </div><div class="t m17d x8 hb y3f ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">where he was told that if the Holy Spirit lived in him, he would </div><div class="t m220 x8 hb y212 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">show physical proof of it. During worship meetings the air was </div><div class="t m221 x8 hb y213 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">filled with the sound of strange tongues, but no matter how hard </div><div class="t m222 x8 hb y214 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Roberto prayed, he never experienced evidences such as those of </div><div class="t m5f x8 hb y215 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">other worshipers.

Still hungering for that personal relationship </div><div class="t m226 x8 hb y21b ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">with Jesus, Roberto invited the two laymen to hold Bible studies </div><div class="t m227 x35 hb y21c ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in his home and invited friends from his charismatic church to join </div><div class="t ma x35 hb y21d ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">them. </div><div class="t m175 x58 hb y21e ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">As the group studied God&apos;s Word together, Roberto realized </div><div class="t m228 x35 hb y21f ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that these men truly were following the Bible.

How could he pay off the loan if the bakery closed </div><div class="t m22e x35 hb y228 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">on Saturday? But Roberto was determined to obey God. He closed </div><div class="t m1b1 x35 hb y5f ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the bakery on Sabbath.
