He joined a charismatic group, </div><div class="t m17d x9 hd y40 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">where he was told that if the Holy Spirit lived in him, he would </div><div class="t m220 x9 hd y213 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">show physical proof of it. During worship meetings the air was </div><div class="t m221 x9 hd y214 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">filled with the sound of strange tongues, but no matter how hard </div><div class="t m222 x9 hd y215 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Roberto prayed, he never experienced evidences such as those of </div><div class="t m5f x9 hd y216 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">other worshipers. He became uncomfortable with his church. </div><div class="t m223 x20 hd y217 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">One day two Christian laymen stopped by his home in Leyte, </div><div class="t mfa x36 hd y218 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Philippines. They were members of The Quiet Hour evangelistic </div><div class="t m224 x36 hd y219 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">team that was holding meetings in the city. Roberto told the men </div><div class="t m225 x36 hd y21a ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that his charismatic church used a large room in his home to hold </div><div class="t m178 x9 hd y21b ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">worship services. Still hungering for that personal relationship </div><div class="t m226 x9 hd y21c ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">with Jesus, Roberto invited the two laymen to hold Bible studies </div><div class="t m227 x36 hd y21d ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in his home and invited friends from his charismatic church to join </div><div class="t ma x36 hd y21e ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">them. </div><div class="t m175 x59 hd y21f ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">As the group studied God&apos;s Word together, Roberto realized </div><div class="t m228 x36 hd y220 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that these men truly were following the Bible. A wonderful peace </div><div class="t m229 x36 hd y221 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">filled his heart. </div><div class="t m22a x59 hd y222 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">As Bible studies progressed, Roberto was surprised to discover </div><div class="t m22b x36 hd y223 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that keeping Sunday holy was not taught in the Bible. Before the </div><div class="t m22c x36 hd y224 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">week ended, Roberto decided to keep the Bible Sabbath. But his </div><div class="t m22c x36 hd y225 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">wife was unhappy with his decision.

How could he pay off the loan if the bakery closed </div><div class="t m22e x36 hd y229 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">on Saturday? But Roberto was determined to obey God. He closed </div><div class="t m1b1 x36 hd y60 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the bakery on Sabbath. To his wife&apos;s surprise, they made more </div><div class="t m22f x5a hd y22a ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">money in six days than they had made when they were open seven </div><div class="t m230 x5a hd y22b ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">days a week. </div><div class="t m227 x59 hd y22c ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Roberto began paying tithe. &quot;The Lord has changed my life and </div><div class="t m231 x5a hd y22d ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">given me such joy,&quot; he explained to his wife. &quot;I want to do this.&quot; </div><div class="t m232 x5a hd y22e ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">But even after seeing the bakery prosper when it closed on Sab-</div><div class="t m5a x5a hd y22f ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">baths, his wife resisted his attempts to tithe. </div><div class="t m233 x59 hd y230 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;I want my share of the business.
