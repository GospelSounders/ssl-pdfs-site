All week Lidia prayed that God would intervene </div><div class="t m50 x29 hc y2db ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">so she would not have to work on Sabbath. But by Sabbath morn-</div><div class="t m4c4 x7d hc y351 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ing nothing had happened to prevent their trip, and the couple </div><div class="t m132 x7d hc y2de ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">hitched their donkey to the cart and set out for the country. </div><div class="t m6ab x56 hc y588 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">While the family ate lunch, they heard a commotion outside. </div><div class="t m1a4 x7d hc y6d ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Ivan ran to the front door to see what had happened. There he saw </div><div class="t m2c3 x7d hc y522 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">his donkey lying in the middle of the road. Several neighbors stood </div><div class="t m236 x7d hc y2e1 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">looking at the animal. &quot;Something happened to your donkey,&quot; one </div><div class="t m1c8 x7d hc y589 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">man told Ivan. &quot;He just fell to the ground.&quot; </div><div class="t m6bd x1d hc y58a ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;How can that be?&quot; Ivan said, examining the donkey. &quot;He was </div><div class="t m49b x7d hc y2a4 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">fine a little while ago.&quot; Ivan ordered the animal to stand, but the </div><div class="t m6be x7d hc y538 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">donkey did not respond. Ivan jerked on the halter and shouted at </div><div class="t m7a x7d hc y58b ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the donkey to get up, but the donkey did not move. </div><div class="t m687 x56 hc y456 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The neighbors pushed and tugged on the animal while Ivan </div><div class="t m7a x7d hc y4bf ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">pulled at the harness. But still the donkey did not respond. </div><div class="t m6bf x56 hc y1b ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;I can&apos;t imagine what is wrong,&quot; Ivan said, shaking his head. </div><div class="t m200 x7d hc y4c0 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;We can&apos;t work in the garden without the donkey.&quot; Angry and </div><div class="t m3ea x3e hc y4c1 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">frustrated, Ivan finally returned to the house to finish his lunch and </div><div class="t m3f7 x3e hc y543 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">mull over the problem. Lidia thanked God for providing a way to </div><div class="t m655 x3e hc y4a3 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">keep the Sabbath but prayed for the donkey&apos;s safety as well. </div><div class="t m28d x56 hc y4c3 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Several times that afternoon Ivan tried to get the donkey to </div><div class="t m111 x3e hc y169 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">stand, but nothing worked. Late in the afternoon Ivan gave up and </div><div class="t m176 x3e hc y4a4 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">slumped on the front step. It would be dark soon; how would they </div><div class="t m6f x3e hc y16b ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">get back to town without the donkey? </div><div class="t m6c0 x64 hc y25 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">At sunset the donkey stirred, then slowly stood to his feet. </div><div class="t m473 x3e hc y403 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Amazed, Ivan ran to see if the donkey was fine. Finding nothing </div><div class="t m17f x3e hc y16c ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">wrong, he hitched the cart to the donkey and called to Lidia that it </div><div class="t m445 x3e hc y3f1 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was time to go home. </div><div class="t m6c1 x64 hc y20e ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Ivan had little to say as they rode home that evening. Finally </div><div class="t m6c2 x27 hc y3f2 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Lidia broke the silence. &quot;I think that God made our donkey sleep </div><div class="t m111 x3e hc y3f3 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">all day so that I could keep the Sabbath holy,&quot; she said. </div><div class="t m3f3 x64 hc y248 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Ivan would not admit it, but he wondered as he listened to the </div><div class="t m534 x27 hc y386 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">donkey&apos;s brisk clip-clop on the road if Lidia might be right.
