Many of Paul&apos;s letters were </div><div class="t m5b7 x55 h6 y6ed ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">written to Christians, often on the assumption that these people already </div><div class="t m2a1 x55 h6 y714 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">knew the Lord and were already in the faith. Indeed, most of the New </div><div class="t m297 x55 h6 y6ef ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Testament was written to those already in the faith. Nevertheless, that </div><div class="t m5ae x55 h6 y715 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">didn&apos;t stop Paul (and the others) from giving the churches more light. </div><div class="t m5b8 xab h2d y92 ff1 fs1a fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Read </div><div class="t m395 x47 h5 y92 ff1 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0"> Romans 1:1-7, Galatians 1:1-5, Ephesians 1:1-4, 1 Thessalo-</div><div class="t m5b9 x55 h5 y6f2 ff1 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">nians 4:13-18.

The </div><div class="t m302 x55 h6 y1fa ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">answer, of course, is that we most definitely do. </div><div class="t m4db x47 h6 y1fb ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">For instance, millions of Christians believe the dead go right to </div><div class="t md x55 h6 ya1 ff4 fs2 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">heaven or right to hell immediately at death.
