His perfect character is changeless. As a </div><div class="t m348 x9a ha y37e ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">transcript of His character, His law also is perfect.

By misrepresenting </div><div class="t m34b x9a ha y3d ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">His character, Lucifer gave God a bad reputation. Stirred by jealousy, he </div><div class="t m20c x9a ha y19b ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">charged God with being arbitrary, harsh, unfair, and untruthful. He </div><div class="t m34c x9a ha y19c ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">argued that if he were in control, things would be different. </div><div class="t m34d x3f ha y380 ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">In order to reveal the true nature of Satan&apos;s work, God must both </div><div class="t m28 x9a ha y19d ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">allow sin to fully develop, and He must demonstrate His own character </div><div class="t m34e x12 ha y381 ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in contrast to that of Satan.

God wants to do more than just proclaim us righteous (forgive our </div><div class="t m350 x12 ha y384 ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">past sin). He also wants to make us righteous (restore us). Through the </div><div class="t m1cb x12 ha y1a4 ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">grace and power that Jesus bought for us at Calvary, we can live out His </div><div class="t m351 x12 ha y1cf ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">character.
