He </div><div class="t m47a x37 h28 y638 ff5 fs1a fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">rolled his eyes and said &quot;Yes, I know, just as you asked God to </div><div class="t m46a x37 h28 y639 ff5 fs1a fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">keep the snow away.&quot; </div><div class="t m47b x76 h28 y1ec ff5 fs1a fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Maybe God is trying to talk to you,&quot; I said.
