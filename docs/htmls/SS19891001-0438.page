Such an </div><div class="t m373 x7c hd y35b ff2 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">application is quite biblical. (See Rev. 19:15, 21.) Even so, the sword </div><div class="t mf5 x7c hd y35c ff2 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">emanating from Christ&apos;s mouth in Revelation chapter 1 also represents the </div><div class="t m1cc x7c hd y57e ff2 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">spiritual support that He imparts to His church. Paul spoke of &quot;the sword </div><div class="t me3 x7c hd y4be ff2 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of the Spirit, which is the word of God&quot; (Eph. 6:17; compare Heb. 4:12). </div><div class="t m1af x7c hd y4bf ff2 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">After His resurrection, Jesus &quot;breathed on them, and saith unto them, Re-</div><div class="t m3dc x7c hd y4c0 ff2 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ceive ye the Holy Ghost&quot; (John 20:22). This is the background to John&apos;s </div><div class="t m3dd x7c hd y57f ff2 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">vision of Christ in Revelation 1. The &quot;oil&quot; of Zechariah, and the &quot;sword&quot; </div><div class="t m398 x7c hd y363 ff2 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of Revelation both symbolize Christ&apos;s gift of the Spirit to His people. </div><div class="t m3de x7c he y580 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">8.
