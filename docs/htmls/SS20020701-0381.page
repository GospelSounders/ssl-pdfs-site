He loves to share his love for </div><div class="t m2b0 x4c h33 y818 ff1 fs1d fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Christ. </div><div class="t m34d x7 h33 y819 ff1 fs1d fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">David works for the railroad. His superiors allowed him to work on </div><div class="t m30c x4c h33 y81a ff1 fs1d fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Sunday instead of Sabbath, but they warned him not to share his faith </div><div class="t m37 x4c h33 y81b ff1 fs1d fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">at work. However, David could not keep his faith a secret. When his </div><div class="t m27c x4c h33 y81c ff1 fs1d fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">co-workers asked him why he no longer worked on Saturday, he told </div><div class="t m4a5 x4c h33 y890 ff1 fs1d fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">them. Soon he was giving two of his friends Bible studies. </div><div class="t m151 x4d h33 y81d ff1 fs1d fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">While visiting his brother in another town, David met a Protestant </div><div class="t m226 x4c h33 y891 ff1 fs1d fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">pastor and shared the Sabbath truth with him. When the pastor resisted this </div><div class="t m28f x6b h33 y81f ff1 fs1d fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">new truth, David read him John 14:15, &quot; &apos;If you love me, you will obey </div><div class="t m448 x4c h33 y892 ff1 fs1d fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">what I command,&apos; &quot; and Isaiah 30:21, &quot; &apos;This is the way; walk in it&apos; &quot; </div><div class="t m7 x4c h33 y893 ff1 fs1d fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">(NIV). The pastor then said, &quot;Come to my church tonight. Tell the people </div><div class="t m663 x4c h33 y894 ff1 fs1d fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">about the Sabbath. If they accept it, you may study the Bible with them.&quot; </div><div class="t m2ce x4d h33 y1f ff1 fs1d fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">David presented the Sabbath message to 40 people that evening. </div><div class="t m267 x4c h33 y895 ff1 fs1d fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;We have never heard this before,&quot; they cried. &quot;Will you come and </div><div class="t m150 x4c h33 y823 ff1 fs1d fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">teach us more?&quot; David returned the next day, Sabbath morning, and </div><div class="t m41d x4c h33 y896 ff1 fs1d fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">again on Sunday to teach the people. He found the church packed. </div><div class="t m3f4 x6b h33 y825 ff1 fs1d fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">While some resisted the new truth, many wanted to begin keeping the </div><div class="t m6be x6b h33 y897 ff1 fs1d fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Sabbath immediately. But David had to return home. He urged the </div><div class="t m436 x6b h33 y827 ff1 fs1d fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">people to study the Bible and let God teach them. </div><div class="t m6bf x4d h33 y898 ff1 fs1d fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Several weeks later the Protestant pastor invited David to come </div><div class="t m134 x6b h33 y5cf ff1 fs1d fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">study with several people who wanted to become Seventh-day </div><div class="t m399 x6b h33 y899 ff1 fs1d fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Adventists. David took a three-week leave from work and invited his </div><div class="t m2d4 x6b h33 y89a ff1 fs1d fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">own pastor to accompany him to study with the people. They found </div><div class="t m303 x6b h33 y82a ff1 fs1d fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that a number of people had been keeping the Sabbath and had saved </div><div class="t m1a6 x6b h33 y7d9 ff1 fs1d fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">their tithes and offerings, which they presented to David&apos;s pastor. </div><div class="t m472 x59 h33 y82c ff1 fs1d fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Nineteen people were baptized, in-</div><div class="t m55 x60 h33 y89b ff1 fs1d fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">cluding the Protestant pastor and his </div><div class="t m5d8 x60 h33 y82d ff1 fs1d fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">wife.
