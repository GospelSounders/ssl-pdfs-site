Some are deep-rooted, others </div><div class="t m7f x32 h15 y67 ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">superficial; some are of short duration, others last a life- </div><div class="t m80 x32 h15 y68 ff3 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">time. Some are purely functional, others intensely personal. </div><div class="t m40 x32 h16 y69 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">We relate to all kinds of people: to a partner, to children, to relatives, </div><div class="t m81 x32 h16 y6a ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to friends and neighbors but also to the service-station attendant, to </div><div class="t m82 x32 h16 y6b ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the person with whom we share a shift at work, and to the police offi-</div><div class="t m83 x32 h16 y6c ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">cer who stops us for speeding.

The </div><div class="t m86 x32 h16 y70 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">difference between us and our non-Christian counterparts is not that </div><div class="t m87 x32 h16 y71 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">we live in multiple relationships but that there is an important extra </div><div class="t m88 x32 h16 y72 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">dimension to those relationships: our religion. </div><div class="t m89 x33 h16 y73 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">As Seventh-day Adventists, we believe in a set of doctrines. Some </div><div class="t m8a x32 h16 y74 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">we share with other Christians; some are unique to us and help mark </div><div class="t m8b x32 h16 y75 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">us as a </div><div class="t m8c x2e h16 y76 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">special </div><div class="t m8d x6 h16 y76 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">people with a unique message and mission.

They help </div><div class="t m93 x32 h16 y7c ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">us achieve a clearer sense of who and what God (as Father, Son, and </div><div class="t m10 x32 h16 y7d ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Holy Spirit) is and what He has done, is doing, and will ultimately do </div><div class="t m94 x32 h16 y7e ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">for us as individuals and as a race.
