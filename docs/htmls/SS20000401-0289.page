Still interested in learning more </div><div class="t m695 x20 ha y582 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">about the Bible and eager to practice his English, he decided to go. </div><div class="t m581 x20 ha y5ae ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">After the meeting he talked with the pastor. When the pastor put </div><div class="t mc2 x78 ha y107 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">his hand on Bogdan&apos;s shoulder and asked God to touch his life, a </div><div class="t m696 x78 ha y549 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">frightening power seemed to surge through his body, and his heart </div><div class="t m6c x78 ha y584 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">began beating wildly. </div><div class="t m3c x21 ha y54b ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Shaken, Bogdan went home and told his father about what had </div><div class="t m1a2 x78 ha y54c ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">happened.

At the close of the series, </div><div class="t m244 x78 ha y17a ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the evangelist announced that the local pastor would hold a Rev-</div><div class="t m9d x78 ha y10f ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">elation Seminar. Eagerly Bogdan attended, and there he found the </div><div class="t m189 x78 ha y550 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">keys that unlocked this fascinating book. But the knowledge he </div><div class="t m3a1 x78 ha y552 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">gained left him in turmoil. </div><div class="t m4a9 x1d ha y553 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">He had accepted an offer to study brewing in Hungary as part </div><div class="t m18e x78 ha y554 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of his work, but new insights into the truths of the Bible left him </div><div class="t m697 x78 ha y555 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">wondering how the principles of Christianity and a career in the </div><div class="t m698 x78 ha y556 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">brewery business could coexist. </div><div class="t m522 x1d ha y557 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Bogdan quit his job in the brewery and was baptized.

Was God calling him to be a pastor? It </div><div class="t m269 x19 ha y559 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">seemed impossible. He had no job and no money to pay tuition. </div><div class="t m41c x1d ha y55a ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Nevertheless, if God was calling him, he must go. But God </div><div class="t m78 x19 ha y712 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">would have to perform a miracle. He confided his convictions in </div><div class="t m5bc x19 ha y55c ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the pastor, who told him that nothing was impossible for God.
