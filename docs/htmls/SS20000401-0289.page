Still interested in learning more </div><div class="t m695 x21 hc y583 ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">about the Bible and eager to practice his English, he decided to go. </div><div class="t m581 x21 hc y5af ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">After the meeting he talked with the pastor.

Was God calling him to be a pastor? It </div><div class="t m269 x1a hc y55a ff1 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">seemed impossible.
