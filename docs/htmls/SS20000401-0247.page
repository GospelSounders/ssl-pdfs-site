H. Zachary </div><div class="t m414 x67 h18 y2a0 ff1 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The evangelism training seminar in Germany had just ended. </div><div class="t m11b x50 h18 y582 ff1 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">As Uwe Wiesenberg, one of the participants, drove home, he was </div><div class="t m378 x50 h18 y583 ff1 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">eager to share his faith with someone. But this was Germany, </div><div class="t m4c0 x50 h18 y3e ff1 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">where people&apos;s materialistic focus makes witnessing for Christ </div><div class="t m4c1 x7c h18 y584 ff1 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">difficult. As he drove, he asked God to help him find someone </div><div class="t m1c6 x50 h18 y54a ff1 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">who needed to know Him. </div><div class="t m324 x80 h18 y585 ff1 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">He stopped to visit his uncle Paul, a hospital nurse who also had </div><div class="t m139 x7c h18 y586 ff1 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">attended the seminar. As Uwe stood in the hospital foyer, an old </div><div class="t m262 x7c h18 y54d ff1 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">man walked up and began talking to him. He told Uwe that he had </div><div class="t m4c2 x7c h18 y426 ff1 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">decided to end his life. </div><div class="t m113 x80 h18 y54f ff1 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Uwe guided the man to a bench and listened as the man unbur-</div><div class="t m290 x7c h18 y17b ff1 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">dened his heart, telling a story of heartache and disappointment. </div><div class="t m2a7 x7c h18 y110 ff1 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Uwe could understand why the man was deeply depressed. </div><div class="t m2a9 x80 h18 y551 ff1 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">When the man stopped talking, Uwe shared his faith in God and </div><div class="t m4c3 x7c h18 y552 ff1 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">his confidence in the power of prayer. He shared the story of Jesus </div><div class="t m4c4 x7c h18 y554 ff1 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and the love of God that led Jesus to die on the cross. &quot;God loves </div><div class="t m58 x7c h18 y555 ff1 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">you very much,&quot; Uwe offered. &quot;He will forgive your sins and fill </div><div class="t m4c5 x7c h18 y42b ff1 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">your heart with joy and peace. He will make you a new man.&quot; </div><div class="t m3d7 x7c h18 y557 ff1 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Then the two men prayed. </div><div class="t m52 x80 h18 y42c ff1 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Hope flickered in the man&apos;s eyes, and a smile crept across his </div><div class="t m4c6 x7c h18 y4c0 ff1 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">face. Then the man asked, &quot;May I go to church with you?&quot; </div><div class="t m413 x80 h18 y587 ff1 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">As Uwe began to explain that he does not live in Neustadt, his </div><div class="t m4c7 x7c h18 y559 ff1 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">uncle Paul walked up. Uwe introduced him to the old man and </div><div class="t m348 x7c h18 y588 ff1 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">relayed the man&apos;s request to go to church. Paul promised to take </div><div class="t m4c8 x7c h18 y55b ff1 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">him the next Sabbath and then for a walk in the Black Forest </div><div class="t m319 x7c h18 y55c ff1 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">where they could commune with God. Paul arranged with the man </div><div class="t m3d5 x7c h18 y55d ff1 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to begin Bible studies. </div><div class="t m2f x80 h18 y589 ff1 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;I have never met such wonderful people in all my life!&quot; the old </div><div class="t m4c9 x85 h18 y55f ff1 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">man smiled. Uwe and Paul gave him a copy of </div><div class="t m4ca xa4 h18 y55f ff6 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Steps to Christ, </div><div class="t m2a3 x85 h18 y58a ff1 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">then the three men prayed. The old man said, &quot;I wanted to end my </div><div class="t m171 x85 h18 y4b7 ff1 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">life today; now I have been born anew!&quot; </div><div class="t m359 x4e h18 y58b ff1 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Uwe&apos;s enthusiasm bubbled over as he shared how, in just one </div><div class="t m4cb x85 h18 y561 ff1 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">hour, God had answered his prayer for one soul by bringing this </div><div class="t m4cc x85 h18 y562 ff1 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">man to him. &quot;He came in despair, and now he has hope,&quot; Uwe </div><div class="t m4cd x85 h18 y58c ff1 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">said. &quot;I thank God for the power of the Holy Spirit. Souls can be </div><div class="t m4ce x85 h18 y564 ff1 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">won to Jesus even here in Germany.&quot; </div><div class="t m4cf x4e h34 y58d ff5 fs1b fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">J. H.
