A PLACE OF.

This privilege was usually recognized, although </div><div class="t m36e x64 h20 y8f4 ff4 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">not always maintained. </div><div class="t m4d0 x96 h20 y8f5 ff4 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">This practice had a biblical basis. (See 1 Kings 1:50-53.) It was a means </div><div class="t mb7 x64 h20 y8f6 ff4 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of protecting those who had committed a crime unintentionally.

(Compare 1 Kings 2:28-31.) In ancient Israel there were cities </div><div class="t m22f x64 h20 y8f9 ff4 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of refuge set apart to protect people who felt that they might be targets of </div><div class="t m13a x64 h20 y8fa ff4 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">retaliation (Num. 35:9-34). How efficient they were in practice is not </div><div class="t m212 x64 h20 y8fb ff4 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">known, but the Lord designed them to be a means of protection. </div><div class="t m4c8 x96 h20 y257 ff4 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The psalmist felt safe only when God made provision for his safety, </div><div class="t m4d1 x64 h20 y258 ff4 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">when God hid him in His pavilion.

It means providing a basis for him </div><div class="t m15c x64 h20 y262 ff4 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">or her to stand without being overthrown. In this phraseology we see that </div><div class="t md2 x66 h20 y263 ff4 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">God not only protects but also provides a sound basis for protection.
