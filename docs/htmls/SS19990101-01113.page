When the pastor invited the </div><div class="t m6a4 xa he y351 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">man to join the Bible-study group, he answered, &quot;My hands are my </div><div class="t m2b8 xa he y609 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">gods.

He endured two months of </div><div class="t m79 x2a he y354 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">treatments, but nothing seemed to help. Finally the doctor told him </div><div class="t m132 x2a he y58a ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">he would need surgery to cure the paralysis. </div><div class="t m4a5 x26 he y58b ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">When the man asked the pastor to visit him, the pastor hurried </div><div class="t m653 x2a he y357 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to his hospital room.

The pastor decided to </div><div class="t m34c x2a he y457 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">test him. &quot;We will pray for you,&quot; he said, watching the man&apos;s face </div><div class="t m12e x2a he y2c9 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">for his reaction. </div><div class="t m79 x26 he y1c ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;I am ready for anythingâ€”anything,&quot; the man said in a subdued </div><div class="t m4a3 x2a he y35a ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tone. </div><div class="t m72e x1e he y4c2 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The pastor organized prayer groups to meet every night and </div><div class="t m12f x2a he y544 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">pray for Sofia&apos;s husband.
