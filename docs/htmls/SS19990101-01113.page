When the pastor invited the </div><div class="t m6a4 x9 hc y350 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">man to join the Bible-study group, he answered, &quot;My hands are my </div><div class="t m2b8 x9 hc y608 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">gods.

He endured two months of </div><div class="t m79 x29 hc y353 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">treatments, but nothing seemed to help. Finally the doctor told him </div><div class="t m132 x29 hc y589 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">he would need surgery to cure the paralysis. </div><div class="t m4a5 x25 hc y58a ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">When the man asked the pastor to visit him, the pastor hurried </div><div class="t m653 x29 hc y356 ff5 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to his hospital room.
