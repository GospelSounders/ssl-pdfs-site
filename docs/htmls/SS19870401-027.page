First, Luke is an evangelist. At the </div><div class="t m110 x45 h2f yf2 ff4 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">end of his Gospel he wants his readers (including us today) to confess Jesus </div><div class="t m111 x45 h2f yf3 ff4 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">as Lord.

His Gospel is intended </div><div class="t m123 x45 h2f y105 ff4 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">as a primer in the Christian faith.
