Yet as we consider carefully the language and context of this </div><div class="t m6b1 xe5 hd y28f ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">verse, this likely explanation emerges: people in Corinth were appar-</div><div class="t m557 xe5 hd y290 ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ently involved in the practice of baptizing for the dead, and Paul uses </div><div class="t mb3 xe5 hd y291 ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">this to bolster his argument of the resurrection. The very fact that they </div><div class="t m697 xe5 hd y4ec ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">were baptizing for the dead shows clearly that they believed in some </div><div class="t m7cd xe5 hd y310 ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">form of resurrection of the dead. And because the people already had </div><div class="t m544 xe5 hd y57 ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">such belief, Paul tries to redirect it to believe in the glorious resurrec-</div><div class="t m302 xe5 hd y311 ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tion of Christ and His followers. </div><div class="t m68e xa8 hd y312 ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Paul by no means supports the idea of baptism for the dead.

Baptism requires a personal decision of repentance </div><div class="t m2c0 xe6 hd ya68 ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">from sin and faith in Christ. (See Mark 16:16; Acts 2:38-41; Ezek. </div><div class="t m968 xe6 hd y299 ff5 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">14:14, 16.)
