In book study the </div><div class="t m90 x3d h17 y8b ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">student concentrates on a particular book to discover what God is trying to teach in </div><div class="t m91 x3d h17 y8c ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that book. There is a reason God guided the church in including in the canon each of </div><div class="t m92 x3d h17 y8d ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the 66 books that are in the Bible, and this reason needs to be discovered. </div><div class="t m93 x3c h17 y8e ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">In true book study the student does not begin with a particular topic and then study </div><div class="t m94 x3d h17 y8f ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">what the book says about that topic. He carefully examines chapter after chapter to </div><div class="t m95 x3d h17 y90 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">understand the basic theme that the inspired author has developed. This is called the </div><div class="t m96 x3d h17 y91 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">inductive method of Bible study. It is one of the most fruitful methods of study </div><div class="t m97 x3d h17 y92 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">because it examines all that is said in a particular book, and every part is examined in </div><div class="t m98 x3d h17 y93 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the context of the whole. </div><div class="t m99 x3c h17 y94 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">In our study of the book of Romans we will have to pass over rapidly certain </div><div class="t m9a x3d h17 y95 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sections of the book, because one quarter is too brief a time to study all the book&apos;s </div><div class="t m9b x3d h17 y96 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">details. Despite this restriction, every effort has been made to present God&apos;s basic </div><div class="t m9c x3d h17 y97 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">message in the book. Students who have the time and the inclination can undertake a </div><div class="t m9d x3d h17 y98 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">more thorough study. They will be richly rewarded. The fact that we named the </div><div class="t m9e x3d h17 y99 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">lessons &quot;Redemption in Romans&quot; is not intended to restrict the inductive study of the </div><div class="t m7c x3d h17 y9a ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">book in any way. </div><div class="t m9f x3c h17 y9b ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">There is one rule of Bible study that is basic, especially in book study. This rule can </div><div class="t ma0 x3d h17 y9c ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">be variously stated, but following is a simple form of it: In the study of the Bible one </div><div class="t ma1 x3d h17 y9d ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">must seek to discover what the words of Scripture were designed to mean to those to </div><div class="t ma2 x3d h17 y9e ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">whom they were first addressed; after that, what they mean for us today. This does not </div><div class="t m79 x3d h17 y9f ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">mean that what the Scriptures meant and what they mean in any given passage is </div><div class="t ma3 x3d h17 ya0 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">necessarily different. But historical circumstances change. Seventh-day Adventists </div><div class="t ma4 x3d h17 ya1 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">are fortunate to have the spirit of prophecy to apply the message of Scripture to our </div><div class="t ma5 x3d h17 ya2 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">age. </div><div class="t ma6 x3c h17 ya3 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Commenting on the Sermon on the Mount, Ellen White encourages the use of this </div><div class="t ma7 x3d h17 ya4 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">rule in this way: </div><div class="t ma8 x3c h17 ya5 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Let us in imagination go back to that scene, and, as we sit with the disciples on the </div><div class="t ma9 x3d h17 ya6 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">mountainside, enter into the thoughts and feelings that filled their hearts. Under-</div><div class="t m95 x3d h17 ya7 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">standing what the words of Jesus meant to those who heard them, we may discern in </div><div class="t maa x3d h17 ya8 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">them a new vividness and beauty, and may also gather for ourselves their deeper </div><div class="t mab x26 h17 ya9 ff7 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">lessons.&quot;—Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, </div><div class="t mac x3e h17 yaa ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">p. 1. </div><div class="t mad x3c h17 yab ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Applied to the book of Romans, this rule means that we must discover first what the </div><div class="t mae x26 h17 yac ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">words of Paul meant to the Roman Christians. Paul had a particular reason for writing </div><div class="t ma1 x26 h17 yad ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to the Roman congregation. There were certain issues he wished to clarify. These we </div><div class="t maf x26 h17 yae ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">must understand. But Paul did not write the letter merely for the benefit of the Roman </div><div class="t mb0 x26 h17 yaf ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Christians. Ellen White wrote: </div><div class="t mb1 x3f h17 yb0 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;He hoped that other churches also might be helped by the instruction sent to the </div><div class="t m3 x26 h17 yb1 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Christians at Rome; but how dimly could he foresee the far-reaching influence of his </div><div class="t mb2 x26 h17 yb2 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">words! Through all the ages the great truth of justification by faith has stood as a </div><div class="t mb3 x26 h17 yb3 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">mighty beacon to guide repentant sinners into the way of life. It was this light that </div><div class="t mb4 x26 h17 yb4 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">scattered the darkness which enveloped Luther&apos;s mind and revealed to him the </div><div class="t mb5 x26 h17 yb5 ff2 fsd fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">power of the blood of Christ to cleanse from sin.
