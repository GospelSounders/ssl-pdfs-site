They often cite passages like Psalm 90:4 in </div><div class="t m87 x9f hd y42d ff5 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">support of their position.

This </div><div class="t m3c6 xa0 hd y435 ff5 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">is done only when a 24-hour day is intended. Another is that the days </div><div class="t m3c7 xa0 hd y304 ff5 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">are set off by the expression &quot;and there was evening, and there was </div><div class="t m298 xa0 hd y305 ff5 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">monting&quot;(NIV).
