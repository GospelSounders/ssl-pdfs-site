Despite this they claimed: &quot;We seek your God, as ye do; and </div><div class="t m7f0 x92 he y1f1a ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">we do sacrifice unto Him.&quot; Now they wanted to help build the temple. &quot;Let </div><div class="t m19f7 x92 he yf8e ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">us build with you,&quot; they said. </div><div class="t m1f3 x18 he y15ad ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">2. </div><div class="t md06 x64 he y67c ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">What answer was given them?

To permit the Samaritans to help them </div><div class="t m84b x92 he y11c ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">would throw them right into contact with idolatry again. The answer which </div><div class="t mabb x92 he yc17 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">they returned was decisive and plain. &quot;Ye have nothing to do with us to build </div><div class="t m45b x92 he y1efc ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">an house unto our God,&quot; they said. They made it clear that they would build </div><div class="t m1e7 x92 he y1867 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the, temple themselves, and did not want any help from the Samaritans. </div><div class="t m104a x18 he y1a5b ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">3. </div><div class="t mdb x64 he y1d84 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">How did the Samaritans show that they were not honest in their </div><div class="t m9b9 x15 he y1a3f ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">desire to help? Verse 4. </div><div class="t ma2b x18 he y177f ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">NoTE.—Had they been honest, they might have felt sad that they were not </div><div class="t m7d7 x15 he y1e90 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">permitted to help build, and they would not have tried to harm the men of </div><div class="t m86b x15 he y34a ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Judah.
