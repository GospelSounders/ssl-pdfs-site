First, memories are weak, and we need to </div><div class="t m12e4 xda h35 y1e99 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">refresh our knowledge. Second, we are expected to grow in knowledge, and so we </div><div class="t m1329 xda h35 y1ee ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">need to restudy our faith in order to enlarge our understanding of it. Third, biblical </div><div class="t m770 xda h35 y1f0f ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">truth is of so rich a nature that fresh glimpses of its wealth always await our discovery. </div><div class="t m315 xda h35 y5df ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Fourth, while the substance of truth does not change, the form in which it is cast and </div><div class="t mdef xda h35 y2101 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the appeal that it makes need study from time to time to keep them relevant to the time </div><div class="t m647 xda h35 y1892 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and place where truth is taught. But jewels that are reset do not change their nature </div><div class="t m281 xda h35 y1686 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">though their value may be increased. So it is with truth. After all, God has adapted His </div><div class="t m134d xda h35 y121 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">teachings to the constantly changing human scene—from the Garden of Eden to the </div><div class="t m132f xda h35 y75b ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">advent movement and modern times. </div><div class="t me05 x4 h35 y1dbd ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">On a much smaller scale, each generation of Adventists must take a fresh look at its </div><div class="t m567 xc4 h35 yac4 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">beliefs, applying them to local circumstances and expressing them to meet contem-</div><div class="t me0d xc4 h35 yb2e ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">porary needs. Such study does not yield to unbelief; indeed it provides an opportunity </div><div class="t mae4 xc4 h35 y1725 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to strengthen faith in eternal truths. </div><div class="t m1ee x4 h35 y186b ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Let us consider one more reason for a fresh look at some of our major beliefs. When </div><div class="t m6fd xc4 h35 y197f ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">we first accepted them, they probably came through another person. We need to </div><div class="t m6a3 xc4 h35 y21d3 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">make them our own by means of mature study. By regular, thoughtful attention to </div><div class="t mdd5 xda h35 y1741 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Scripture we can make each doctrine an expression of our own conviction on that </div><div class="t me47 xda h35 y179e ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">subject. We can thus gain a deeply personal faith that is founded on a rich under-</div><div class="t mddc xc4 h35 y1e1c ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">standing of the Bible and a closer fellowship with the Father; Son, and Holy Spirit. </div><div class="t m13aa xc4 h35 y1941 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">And while we are studying, we should remember that our God expects us to serve Him </div><div class="t m5cb xc4 h35 yb3f ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">with all our mind as well as with our other abilities. It has been said that the duty to use </div><div class="t m69b xda h35 y26a ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">our intelligence is. a moral duty, especially in the area of religious knowledge. </div><div class="t m453 xc4 h35 y1c43 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Carrying out that duty may spell the difference between life and death! </div><div class="t m14c xe h35 y41f ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Two quarters&apos; Sabbath School lessons (as we shall have) will not suffice for a </div><div class="t m392 xc4 h35 y6ad ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">survey of all the doctrines of the Seventh-day Adventist Church; so we have to choose </div><div class="t m74c xc4 h35 y16bc ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">some and leave others. The very act of selection may help to underline those teach-</div><div class="t m2e6 xc4 h35 y1a13 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ings that we see as most necessary for the 1980s. Similarly with the choice of </div><div class="t mdc xc4 h35 y1a3b ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">supporting verses—it may stimulate us to find varied scriptural support for beliefs we </div><div class="t m242 xc4 h35 y6b1 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">hold dear. </div><div class="t mde xe h35 y1805 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Finally, and most important of all, there is the need to apply each article of faith to </div><div class="t m1182 xc4 h35 y17a5 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">our way of living. Unless this is done, we are merely collecting lifeless theological </div><div class="t m2b0 xc4 h35 y1e42 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">declarations that become as dry as the proverbial hills of Gilboa. It is our act of </div><div class="t m13ad xc4 h35 yb55 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">applying that gives the Holy Spirit the opportunity to breathe anew into each doctrine </div><div class="t m906 xc4 h35 y169f ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the breath of life that brings a change in our lives. There is not one biblical teaching </div><div class="t mbb2 xc4 h35 y13d ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that does not require personal application to make it come alive for each of us; and </div><div class="t m166f xc4 h35 y851 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">there is not one, no matter how difficult or even theoretical it may appear, that will not </div><div class="t mb8b xc4 h35 y163b ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">bring spiritual life to them that accept and apply it in daily living. </div><div class="t m6c xe h35 y2ad ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Therefore, in the words of the most famous of all citizens of Tarsus: &quot;Keep before </div><div class="t m1a11 xc4 h35 y18bd ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">you an outline of the sound teaching which you heard from me, living by the faith and </div><div class="t meda xc4 h35 y1831 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">love which are ours in Christ Jesus. Guard the treasure put into our charge, with the </div><div class="t m254 xc4 h35 y19a8 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">help of the Holy Spirit dwelling within us&quot; (2 Tim. 1:14, NEB). Then with confidence </div><div class="t m83e xc4 h35 y1b49 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">we shall be able to proclaim, &quot;This we believe!&quot; </div><div class="t m629 x195 h5 y22fb ff3 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">7 </div></div><div class="pi" data-data='{"ctm":[1.000000,0.000000,0.000000,1.000000,0.000000,0.000000]}'></div></div>
