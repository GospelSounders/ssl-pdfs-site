Farmland and forest </div><div class="t m1ad4 x11 h27 y2b43 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">surround small clusters of homes. Life in these villages has changed </div><div class="t m45b x17 h27 y2a8d ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">little over the years. Most people farm or work in nearby textile </div><div class="t m6a x11 h27 y28f2 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">mills, much as their parents did. And most people die in the faith </div><div class="t mb35 x17 h27 y2294 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">into which they were born. </div><div class="t m1181 x5d h27 y1ead ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">During Communist times the few Adventists who lived in such </div><div class="t m3d9 x17 h27 y1e56 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">villages had no ordained pastor. They worshiped quietly in their </div><div class="t m1312 x17 h27 y1350 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">homes. The young leader of one such group had a zeal for sharing </div><div class="t m78e x17 h27 y1f01 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">his faith with others. He could never hope to study theology in a </div><div class="t m368 x11 h27 y1331 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">seminary, but he studied his Bible and became an active soul </div><div class="t mc9 x17 h27 y1427 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">winner. </div><div class="t m1498 x5d h27 y144c ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Word of this young man&apos;s evangelistic efforts spread, and even-</div><div class="t m30f x17 h27 y1d91 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tually the government learned of his religious activities. They tried </div><div class="t m61b x17 h27 y1417 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to quiet him through threats, but that did not work. Finally the </div><div class="t m639 x17 h27 y12cb ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">government sent him to live and work in the forest. His job was to </div><div class="t m1755 x17 h27 y97d ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">gather pitch to be used in the manufacture of plastics and chemi-</div><div class="t mb0f x17 h27 ydca ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">cals. This assignment, the officials felt, would keep him from </div><div class="t m1377 x17 h27 y20a9 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">causing trouble for them, and since few people lived in the forest, </div><div class="t mac0 x17 h27 y1487 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">he would have few people to influence. </div><div class="t m1ee x48 h27 y1af5 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">But the man found that his new job did not require him to work </div><div class="t m1126 x17 h27 y143c ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">long hours. He had even more time to visit people and share his </div><div class="t md8 x17 h27 y1c2f ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">faith. After work he rode his motorcycle into the surrounding </div><div class="t m1128 x3e h27 y1455 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">villages, where he shared the Bible with anyone who would listen. </div><div class="t m1196 x48 h27 y1e09 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">For years the young man worked in the forest, gathering pitch </div><div class="t mc9 x3e h27 y1f7b ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">by day and visiting people at night. He traveled to every village in </div><div class="t mdbb x3e h27 y1fc0 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the region, sharing his love for Christ and studying the Bible with </div><div class="t mea6 x3e h27 y1181 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">anyone who was interested. He organized home worship groups </div><div class="t me0d x3e h27 y10fa ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and encouraged the believers. Some groups had only a few mem-</div><div class="t ma22 x3e h27 y15aa ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">bers, but others had 30 or 40 members. And because he faithfully </div><div class="t m1a29 x3e h27 y102c ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">gathered his quota of pitch in the forest and limited his visitation to </div><div class="t m1ba0 x3e h27 yde3 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the small villages, the government officials seldom bothered him. </div><div class="t mc6 x73 h27 y1360 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">When Communism in Latvia fell and people were again free to </div><div class="t m73a x3e h27 y14f8 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">worship publicly, these small groups of Adventists sponsored Bible </div><div class="t mea2 x3e h27 y1460 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">seminars and evangelistic meetings, inviting their neighbors and </div><div class="t m693 x3e h27 y1192 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">family members.
