It is the keeping of the </div><div class="t m767 xd5 h35 ya0f ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;commandments of God and the faith of Jesus&quot; that John the Revelator saw would </div><div class="t m162 xd5 h35 yd00 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">characterize the saints in the last days. This message is particularly pertinent in </div><div class="t m648 xd5 h35 y12ba ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">today&apos;s world. It is precisely the remedy for the ills of our world and of the church </div><div class="t m7c1 xd5 h35 y7ab ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that arise out of a negative attitude toward law. </div><div class="t m272 xb7 h35 ye0b ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The title of this quarter&apos;s lessons, &quot;Christ our Righteousness,&quot; reflects this </div><div class="t m69b xd0 h35 ycab ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">double, but inseparable, concern. It is a study of Christ who points us to the law, </div><div class="t m6f5 xd0 h35 y97f ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">which is the definition of righteousness, and of the law that points us to Christ who </div><div class="t m7a5 xd0 h35 y9f2 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">is the only means by which the sinner can be in harmony with the law. </div><div class="t m1e2 xb7 h35 ye0d ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">There is the constant risk that the proper relation between Christ and law shall </div><div class="t m6f3 xd0 h35 ybd3 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">not be recognized in a study of salvation by faith. It is this perspective of Christ in </div><div class="t m202 xd0 h35 y95a ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the law that is a root concept of the message we are proclaiming to the world. To </div><div class="t m80c xd0 h35 yf05 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">remove, or tone down, the claims of the law will result in a sentimental religion, </div><div class="t m3f4 xd0 h35 y8bb ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">claiming Jesus as Lord, but failing to do His will. To remove, or tone down, the </div><div class="t ma3c xd0 h35 yd0a ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">truth of salvation by faith in Jesus will result in a legalistic religion in which the </div><div class="t ma79 xd0 h35 y117c ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">believer is in the hopeless situation of seeking salvation by his own deeds. </div><div class="t m5c3 xb9 h35 y101b ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Ellen G.
