Unheralded they came, and in like manner </div><div class="t m19f0 x92 h34 y15b7 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">they disappeared. Then for nineteen centuries the Orient seemed to have little </div><div class="t mbda x92 h34 ybc6 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">connection with Jesus. But now, to the surprise of the Occident, the Orient is </div><div class="t m696 x92 h34 y9e3 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">again beginning to Search for the Lowly One of Nazareth, and to lay before Him </div><div class="t mb4d x92 h34 y4c2 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the gift which to Him is the most precious of all—the heart. </div><div class="t m1470 x26 h34 y334 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">In the Moslem world there are 250,000,000 people who chant their prayers and </div><div class="t m130d x92 h34 y178 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">bow at appointed times with their faces toward Mecca.

This in itself is a miracle of the last days, and one is led to believe that </div><div class="t m9ae x92 h34 y1bb ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">a most wonderful change has come over the Mohammedan mind. Leaders of </div><div class="t m8c3 x92 h34 ydd ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Islam are becoming interested in Christianity; the third angel&apos;s message appeals </div><div class="t m12e5 x92 h34 y156 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to them. </div><div class="t m1336 x26 h34 y75c ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The rays of the Sun of Righteousness are beginning to penetrate the gloom </div><div class="t m788 x92 h34 y217 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that for centuries has enshrouded the teeming millions of Java.

But there is no room. &quot;Not this </div><div class="t m6ef x92 h34 y2c4 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">year; perhaps next year you can come,&quot; is the response. And so our schools, </div><div class="t m4e2 x92 h34 yea ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">though few, are filled with students. </div><div class="t m172b x26 h34 y29 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The older people of the middle class were educated in schools where only the </div><div class="t m124 x92 h34 y253 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Koran was taught.
