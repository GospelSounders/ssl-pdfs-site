Enlightenment is the process whereby a </div><div class="t m58a x29 h2d y2bfd ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">person appreciates the true value of that which has been revealed. It is </div><div class="t m146f x29 h2d y23f7 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">somewhat like a person finding a rare coin in the change received during a </div><div class="t m2ef x29 h2d y2331 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">business transaction.

They are &quot;the riches of his glorious inheritance </div><div class="t m607 x64 h2d y12bd ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in the saints&quot; (Eph. 1:18, RSV). Nothing on earth can compare with the </div><div class="t m2a4 x29 h2d y7d8 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">inheritance awaiting us.

To have that hope is to have something precious </div><div class="t ma3b x64 h2d y1577 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">beyond measure. Paul&apos;s readers still did not comprehend the full meaning </div><div class="t m21b x64 h2d y7e3 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of their calling, and he was anxious that they should see that the Chris-</div><div class="t m443 x64 h2d y7e4 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tian&apos;s hope is based on the facts of redemption. . . . They had forgiveness </div><div class="t m84d x64 h2d y96a ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of sins, they were children of God, but still their eyes were holden.
