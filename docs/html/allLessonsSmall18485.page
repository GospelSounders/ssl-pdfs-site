This is as it </div><div class="t m75b xd5 h35 y215e ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">should be, for without Him in the central position our doctrines cannot be Christian. </div><div class="t me53 xd5 h35 y14c2 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">With Him at their center, their reliability and efficacy are assured. </div><div class="t m107d xb4 h35 y164b ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Each lesson is firmly based on Scripture, the source of all true doctrine. Many of </div><div class="t m377 xd5 h35 y104a ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">those scriptures are well known; others may have received relatively little use. But </div><div class="t m6c xd5 h35 y18c2 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">they will all beir intensive study, especially when seen from a slightly different angle </div><div class="t m37e xd5 h35 y634 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">than that used in the past. Teachers and class members are therefore urged to study </div><div class="t m43c xd5 h35 y1af1 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the Word as deeply as possible. The Word &quot;is quick [or, living], and powerful, and </div><div class="t m137c xd5 h35 y1ab4 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sharper than any twoedged sword, ... and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of </div><div class="t m361 xd5 h35 y1c7a ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the heart&quot; (Heb. 4:12). Let us, then, daily study that Word, that God may reveal to us </div><div class="t m1669 xd5 h35 y1d16 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the purpose He had in.mind in having those particular passages included in the Bible. </div><div class="t m328 xd5 h35 y1652 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Classes where the Word is intensively studied will find sound religious instruction, </div><div class="t mab2 xd5 h35 y1d18 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">spiritual life, and inspiration for daily living. </div><div class="t mabb xb4 h35 y12a2 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The Word is the mine from which doctrines are dug. The doctrines have ever been </div><div class="t m638 xd5 h35 y19b7 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in the Word, embedded in it as gems and minerals are contained in rocks and soil. No </div><div class="t m407 xd5 h35 y13fe ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">true doctrine is of human devising; it is inherent in Holy Writ, there to be quarried by </div><div class="t mb36 xd5 h35 y1ecf ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">those who search the Scriptures to discover revelations of God&apos;s character and His </div><div class="t m7b7 xd0 h35 y1bd0 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ways. These, when found, are formed into shapes more readily understood and </div><div class="t m92 xd5 h35 yb40 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">retained by His children. We should therefore not see doctrines as ready-made </div><div class="t m43c xd5 h35 y1bfd ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">declarations of belief that spare us further mental and spiritual exercise. We need </div><div class="t m1499 xd5 h35 yfa3 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">them in portable form for convenience and as a means of expressing our beliefs to </div><div class="t m34c xd5 h35 y2154 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">others that they may know the substance of our faith. But each belief is infinitely </div><div class="t mdf7 xd0 h35 y133d ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">richer than its summary form. Indeed, to change the figure, the formal doctrine may </div><div class="t m57b xd0 h35 y2064 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">be little more than a label to list the contents of the treasure chest of truth. It is for us to </div><div class="t md8 xd0 h35 y1ce6 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">lift the lid and discover the wealth of revelation that lies within. </div><div class="t m9a1 xb4 h35 y1ffe ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">These illustrations explain why a series of Sabbath School lessons on Christian </div><div class="t m36e xd0 h35 y1bb5 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">doctrine does not attempt to formulate those doctrines.
