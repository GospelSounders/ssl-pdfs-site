Christianity, in practice, is a new relationship between a sinful </div><div class="t mb18 x11 h2d y2a11 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">person and the God.who created and sustains him. Jesus Christ is the direct link </div><div class="t ma3c x11 h2d y2a66 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">between God and man, by His incarnation. He also became the Substitute </div><div class="t m1b5 x11 h2d y2bf5 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and Surety (Pledge, Guarantee) for the sinful race. </div><div class="t m6ec x4a h2d y2868 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Sinful men may enter a new-covenant relationship with God by faith in the </div><div class="t m398 x11 h2d y2438 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Substitute and by continual cooperation with the Surety. Christ takes our sins </div><div class="t ma4f x11 h2d y2344 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and gives us His righteousness. We receive it in two ways. In Him we are </div><div class="t m66e x11 h2d y201a ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">accounted righteous and remain so as long as we maintain our absolute depen-</div><div class="t m167a x11 h2d y2038 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">dence upon Him and His merits.

(See Heb. 10:16.) From and by this inward law all of life is shaped for the </div><div class="t m9e3 x11 h2d yc6a ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">believer. He wills to work out what God puts within. </div><div class="t me5c x4a h2d y1069 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">In our lessons of this quarter we will concentrate upon the inward law and its </div><div class="t m261 x11 h2d y11d3 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">outworking in our individual lives. But it is vital that we recognize throughout </div><div class="t mce3 x11 h2d yec3 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">this study that the outworking of the inward law does nothing toward earning our </div><div class="t m238 x11 h2d yd6e ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">salvation. There is no question of deserving salvation. </div><div class="t m60e x18 h2d y73e ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Our acceptance with God is already secure in Jesus Christ. &quot;Ye are complete </div><div class="t m7a5 x11 h2d ye62 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in Him&quot; (Col. 2:10). What the Father thinks of Christ makes us acceptable, in </div><div class="t m615 x11 h2d y1019 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Him, to God. Let us remember that this law is implanted in the heart by God </div><div class="t m202 x11 h2d y128c ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">when we accept &quot;Jesus only&quot; as our righteousness. By the power of the Holy </div><div class="t m5c3 x11 h2d ya8c ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Spirit, bringing resurrection power into our lives—the same power within Him-</div><div class="t me3a x11 h2d ybd1 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">self by which Jesus rose from the dead—the inward law becomes the motivation </div><div class="t m555 x11 h2d y83e ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and the direction of our lives.

Hence it is the law of love, for God is </div><div class="t m1377 x11 h2d y109d ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">love. This law of love is likewise the law of life—the life of God in us. So we blend </div><div class="t m341 x11 h2d ye4e ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the three elements in the title of the lessons of this quarter—Law, Love, and </div><div class="t m195 x11 h2d y8bc ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Life. Our Saviour becomes the pledge of the fulfillment of all three in our </div><div class="t m102 x11 h2d ydfa ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">standing with God and in our daily experience with God and man. </div><div class="t mb27 x4a h2d y95f ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Basic to human nature and universal in its application is God&apos;s law of love, </div><div class="t ma81 x11 h2d yfc1 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">which transcends all cultures, customs, socioeconomic classes, ages, races, </div><div class="t m73f x11 h2d y76f ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">nationalities, time, and geographical locations. It makes Christianity a religion, </div><div class="t m582 x11 h2d yd0e ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">not of the East or of the West, but of the whole world. A believer from any nation </div><div class="t mb2 x11 h2d yc08 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">does have to accept Jesus Christ as his Saviour and open his heart to the Holy </div><div class="t m89 x11 h2d y98a ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Spirit. </div><div class="t m481 x4a h2d y9bf ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">From the individual and human viewpoint there can be no objective values </div><div class="t m458 x11 h2d y1316 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">despite the claims of moral philosophers.

But if the standard of goodness is given by God, who is </div><div class="t mb98 x11 h2d y10a1 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">absolutely objective, then the establishment of a universally objective law is not </div><div class="t m62a x11 h2d y14b0 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">only possible but sure. </div><div class="t m9c6 x4a h2d y14b1 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Man&apos;s law is enforced by government officers.
