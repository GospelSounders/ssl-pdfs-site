Some </div><div class="t mce8 x17 h27 y879 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Christian women in Corinth seem to have felt that they no longer </div><div class="t m906 x17 h27 y12c2 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">needed to follow time-honored customs.

Among these is a </div><div class="t m63f x3e h27 y5b5 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">principle applicable to any society and time.

He pauses to </div><div class="t mb36 x3e h27 y9ae ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">restate it in a most vivid way: &quot;In the Lord, however, woman is not </div><div class="t maf3 x3e h27 y183 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">independent of man, nor is man independent of woman.
