It is now recognized that in the ancient </div><div class="t m35a x14 h28 y1b9 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">world generally, kingship was sacral—a sacred, cultic office as well </div><div class="t m6f3 x14 h28 y109b ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">as a political position. The king was, in fact, universally acknowl-</div><div class="t m808 x14 h28 y139e ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">edged as a mediator between god(s) and people. This inevitably led </div><div class="t me40 x14 h28 y1971 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to his being considered at least a semidivine person. In Egypt, in-</div><div class="t mf2 x14 h28 y9cf ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">deed, the king was accorded full divine honors; he was a god in </div><div class="t ma38 x14 h28 yd09 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">human form. In Babylonia, on the other hand, the king was recog-</div><div class="t m417 x14 h28 y1457 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">nized as a human being, elevated to near-divine status. . . . Despite </div><div class="t mb57 x14 h28 y1e73 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the differences, in both areas the king was pivotal in the cultic beliefs </div><div class="t m5b9 x14 h28 ybc ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and practices.
