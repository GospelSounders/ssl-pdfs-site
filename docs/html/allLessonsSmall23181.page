And it was now 80 years since Zerubbabel </div><div class="t m37f x66 h87 y2a82 ff1 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">had led the initial migration back home. </div><div class="t m577 x50 h87 y2a26 ff1 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Ezra addressed his appeal to return to Judah to the &quot;chief&quot; </div><div class="t m750 x66 h87 y294d ff1 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">men, the heads of family groups.
