Although we cannot explain what life really is, we see its results, and all </div><div class="t m9c6 xbd h35 y13ba ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">who enjoy life dread the day when it will fade from the body and leave a lifeless </div><div class="t mb57 xbd h35 y1082 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">corpse. </div><div class="t m5e5 x11 h35 y11d3 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">People want to live. There is no greater victory that God can gain for man than the </div><div class="t m1e9 xbd h35 y1169 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">victory over death. That is basic. Without it every other gift becomes meaningless. </div><div class="t m7f0 xbd h35 ye45 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">God&apos;s gift of life must head any list of divine blessings. The Bible is, in a sense, the </div><div class="t m2f9 xbd h35 y631 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">story of God&apos;s efforts to gain for man victory over death and to give him everlasting </div><div class="t m6c3 xbd h35 y1513 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">life. </div><div class="t m246 x11 h35 y1171 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">God has no rival in His power to conquer death and to give eternal life to man, for He </div><div class="t m829 xbd h35 y1563 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">is the Creator. No other god can justly make that claim. </div><div class="t m57f x11 h35 y1175 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Our Creator God formed the earth and created Adam out of the dust of the ground. </div><div class="t m536 xbd h35 y15cf ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">This same God came to this earth and was born a child. When wicked men took His </div><div class="t m381 xbd h35 y1d72 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">life, they could not keep Him in the tomb. By His inherent power the resurrection took </div><div class="t m1e9 xbd h35 y1e08 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">place. </div><div class="t m6c2 x11 h35 y1429 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">In the near future God&apos;s power over death will be demonstrated again in the </div><div class="t mf7 xbd h35 y108b ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">resurrection and immortalization of the saints. Then those who have believed in </div><div class="t m34a xbd h35 y15e5 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Jesus will experience the victory over death for which they have longed. </div><div class="t m5c5 x11 h35 y418 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">When this takes place, God&apos;s children will be able to look forward to an unending </div><div class="t m302 x4 h35 y1fa7 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">life in Paradise. By this resurrection of believers, the purpose of God in creating the </div><div class="t m436 x4 h35 yecb ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">world will at last be realized. We shall enjoy fellowship again with our Creator, and the </div><div class="t m608 xbd h35 y2116 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">entire universe will throb with undiminished love for the Lord. The greatest gift that </div><div class="t m43c x4 h35 y15d2 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">can be given will have been bestowed upon the saints. </div><div class="t m27c x11 h35 y1a29 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">This quarter we shall study about the Lord as Creator and Life-giver. The lessons </div><div class="t m1ec x4 h35 y1420 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">will include the questions of time in the creation of the world, and of the relation of the </div><div class="t mb1b x4 h35 y74c ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Flood to understanding data often interpreted as supporting evolution. </div><div class="t m394 x11 h35 y1ec1 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">We live in a scientific age. Science dominates the thinking of many people. Some </div><div class="t m883 x4 h35 y1109 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">scientific theories have caused many people to doubt the authority of Scripture. In </div><div class="t m7e8 x4 h35 y1e21 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">these last days it is important for God&apos;s church to understand what is true science and </div><div class="t m14a1 x4 h35 y1504 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to call man back again to the worship of the Creator. The three great messages which </div><div class="t mb0c x4 h35 y102f ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">are to be given in a loud cry in these days can be understood only in the light of the </div><div class="t m829 x4 h35 y1460 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">power and work of the Creator. </div><div class="t m629 x14a h5 y134b ff3 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">7 </div></div><div class="pi" data-data='{"ctm":[1.000000,0.000000,0.000000,1.000000,0.000000,0.000000]}'></div></div>
