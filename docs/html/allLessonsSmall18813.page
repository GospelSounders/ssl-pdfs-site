On the </div><div class="t m88c x66 h2d yc44 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">one hand there&apos;s the demand to come out of the world and to be </div><div class="t m399 x66 h2d y818 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">separate from it. On the other hand we are plainly told that the </div><div class="t mcdd x66 h2d y209c ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">essence of being the church in the world is to become one with the </div><div class="t ma71 x63 h2d y13e7 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">people of the world in taking an interest in their needs, interests, </div><div class="t m69f x63 h2d y7ea ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">work, and ambitions. Since both views are clearly biblical, we </div><div class="t m5f2 x63 h2d y13e8 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">now must give consideration to the question: How are these two </div><div class="t m2ff x63 h2d y13e9 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">views related? And how can they both be implemented? Let there </div><div class="t m52f x63 h2d ye05 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">be no misunderstanding about it: The church must be both </div><div class="t m230 x63 h2d y20e4 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">wholly different from the world—in its life-style, thought pat-</div><div class="t m4c4 x63 h2d ya44 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">terns, and conduct—and at the same time be part of the world and </div><div class="t m8f x63 h2d y595 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">identify with its needs and activities. It cannot be denied that </div><div class="t m751 x63 h2d y900 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">there is an inherent tension here. But we must learn to live with </div><div class="t m67 x63 h2d y8d6 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that tension and make it fruitful in our lives. </div><div class="t me44 x59 h6c y890 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Describe the role of an ambassador for Christ.

In order to </div><div class="t mbb7 x63 h2d y3a4 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">do so we must be both a member of the household of Christ and a </div><div class="t m7b7 x63 h2d y8be ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">child of this world in the same way that Christ Himself was both </div><div class="t mb26 x63 h2d y860 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the Son of God and the Son of man. Christian life in the world is </div><div class="t m4c8 x63 h2d y547 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">characterized by a pendulum movement. We are called out of the </div><div class="t ma60 x5b h2d y570 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">world and sent back in; we are gathered and dispersed. This </div><div class="t mf55 x5b h2d y4b3 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">pendulum movement has at least three aspects. First, there is </div><div class="t m755 x5b h2d yc3f ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the weekly rhythm of coming out of the world where we live and </div><div class="t m751 x5b h2d y2e9 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">work to worship and fellowship together on God&apos;s holy day. As </div><div class="t m16d x5b h2d y14 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">we worship and fellowship together, we realize that we are not </div><div class="t ma44 x5b h2d y707 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">doing it for our own selves, but to the glory of God and for the </div><div class="t m837 x5b h2d y670 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sake of the world. Each worship service, therefore, should be a </div><div class="t m81c x5b h2d y89a ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">preparation for our dispersion into the world, for whom the </div><div class="t m977 x5b h2d y2ee ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">church exists. Second, there is our daily involvement in the </div><div class="t m366 x5b h2d ybbd ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">world&apos;s secular affairs and our coming out of the world to be with </div><div class="t m2d7 x5b h2d y4f2 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Christ in our daily devotions.
