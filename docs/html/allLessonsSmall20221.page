Because of the heresy known as Gnosticism that had arisen during </div><div class="t m6bc x74 h28 yf27 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">his lifetime, it was vital for John to connect Jesus definitely with the work </div><div class="t m135 x74 h28 y39e ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of creation. </div><div class="t mab8 x4e h28 y146f ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The promoters of Gnosticism believed themselves to possess advanced </div><div class="t m250 x74 h28 ydf6 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and secret knowledge.

God, they said, was pure spirit, while matter </div><div class="t m871 x74 h28 ydcc ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was flawed and evil. To a Gnostic it was inconceivable that a pure and </div><div class="t m31c x74 h28 yede ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">holy God should ever touch polluted matter. Therefore God could not </div><div class="t m10f6 x74 h28 yedf ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">possibly have carried out the work of creation Himself. </div><div class="t m13e4 x4e h28 yec9 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">In eternity past, they said, He put out from Himself a series of what are </div><div class="t m14c1 x74 h28 yd3e ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">called &quot;emanations.&quot; Each emanation (a kind of radiation) was farther </div><div class="t m582 x73 h28 y14e3 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and farther away from Him. As time passed, the emanations knew less </div><div class="t m318 x73 h28 yc06 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and less about Him. About halfway down the series of emanations one </div><div class="t m12d6 x74 h28 y726 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">came along that finally knew nothing at all about God.
