The series grows out of the three angels&apos; messages of Revela-</div><div class="t m69f x71 h35 y232d ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tion 14. The lessons for each quarter will be on a subject which is included in </div><div class="t m6d2 x71 h35 y209a ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the three angels&apos; messages, but they will not be a study of the passage in </div><div class="t m49c x71 h35 ycf4 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Revelation which records the three messages.

There are two main reasons.

Second, to provide a </div><div class="t m21c x71 h35 y2024 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">connection between one quarter&apos;s lessons and the next. Thus the lessons for </div><div class="t m850 x71 h35 y1fee ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">each quarter will be related to those of the preceding quarter </div><div class="t m5b4 xcd h35 y1fee ff5 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and </div><div class="t m1ad xeb h35 y1fee ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to those of </div><div class="t m62a x71 h35 y11a5 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the following quarter. This sequence of subjects will provide, as the series ad-</div><div class="t m7fb x71 h35 y1fd6 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">vances, a constantly growing base on which each member may build his study </div><div class="t m43c x71 h35 y1489 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in any current quarter. </div><div class="t m13e x61 h35 y1d92 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">While the &quot;Daybreak Series&quot; has been planned with balance and sequence, </div><div class="t m6ad x71 h35 y1179 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">provision has also been made for flexibility.
