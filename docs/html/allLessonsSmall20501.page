It tells us what we must </div><div class="t m134e x73 he y2ce0 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">do if we desire life. It tells us how we can have wisdom—we are to ask God for </div><div class="t m172 x73 he y2cf5 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">it. (See James 1:5, 6.) </div><div class="t m2a4 x28 he y2b89 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The wise man stresses the importance of wisdom this way: &quot;Wisdom is the </div><div class="t m2134 x73 he y2ca8 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">principal thing; therefore get wisdom: and with all thy getting get </div><div class="t m829 x73 he y2c9e ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">understanding&quot; (Prov. 4:7). The psalmist says that the &quot;fear of the Lord is the </div><div class="t m6fd x73 he y2960 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">beginning of wisdom&quot; (Ps. 111:10). Jesus contrasted the wise and the foolish </div><div class="t m165e x73 he y2360 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">virgins in Matthew 25: I -13. He urged that all should watch, because there is one </div><div class="t m6b x73 he y23c0 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">thing that no one knows—that is the time of Christ&apos;s coming. </div><div class="t mdd0 x28 he y2190 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Those who are wise do not selfishly keep their wisdom to themselves. They </div><div class="t m1ce x73 he y12c1 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">share it with others. It was God&apos;s plan and purpose that the children of Israel </div><div class="t m359 x73 he y1b1f ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">would share their laws with others. Then the nations would say: &quot;Surely this </div><div class="t ma49 x73 he y16c7 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">great nation is a wise and understanding people&quot; (Deut. 4:6). God is glorified </div><div class="t m674 x73 he y18b0 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">when His people are blessed because they know and keep His commandments. </div><div class="t me47 x73 h1 y1edf ff1 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">3.

Daniel 11:33-35. </div><div class="t me9a x28 he yc1e ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">God&apos;s people are not promised a bed of roses. Persecution will involve real </div><div class="t m14d0 x73 he y1895 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">hardship. Yet in their deepest trials they will not be left alone. (See Matt. 28:20.) </div><div class="t m400 x48 he y17b2 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Daniel says that they will receive some help. What kind of help do you suppose </div><div class="t mcfa x48 he y1819 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">this will be? How did Jesus feel when He was in the Garden of Gethsemane? In </div><div class="t md15 x48 he y1828 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the case of the disciples Jesus recognized that the &quot;Spirit is willing, but the flesh </div><div class="t m132f x48 he y17b5 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">is weak&quot; (Matt. 26:41). We need always to watch and pray, for we never know </div><div class="t m45b x48 he y9e5 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">when we shall find ourselves in trying circumstances. One thing is certain. Per-</div><div class="t m3ef x48 he yc25 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">secution brings a great test, and those who survive it are purified. The proper </div><div class="t m107d x48 he y1899 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">response to persecution is not to complain or find fault, not to resist and curse, </div><div class="t mea5 x48 he y1711 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">but to bless those who are so cruel and unjust.
