Now we will consider the son who declined </div><div class="t mb64 x64 h22 y21b3 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">his father&apos;s command, but later obeyed. </div><div class="t m437 x6f h22 y2405 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Contrast the attitude and response of this son with the attitude </div><div class="t m4ce x29 h22 y237d ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and response of his brother.

Then he went. Perhaps his work was not impressive, perhaps </div><div class="t m36c x64 h22 y69d ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">his former insolence had impaired both his skill and his staying power. </div><div class="t m644 x64 h22 y6fc ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">But he did his best, and God reckoned the attempt for the deed.&quot;—The </div><div class="t m167a x29 h8b y1018 ff7 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Interpreter&apos;s Bible, vol. </div><div class="t mf53 x98 h22 y7ec ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">7, p. 511. The laying aside of pride reflects </div><div class="t m640 x29 h22 y215d ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">several promising qualities: (1) reflectiveness; (2) humility; (3) willing-</div><div class="t m48a x64 h22 y16c8 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ness to admit wrong; and (4) a desire to do better. </div><div class="t m12e4 x6f h22 yd9 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The son we studied yesterday represented the Pharisees.

But Jesus states that there is more hope for people such as </div><div class="t m374 x64 h22 yde ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">these than there is hope for people who wrap their pride around them </div><div class="t m43b x64 h22 y470 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">like flamboyant scarves. Pride recognizes no need. But those who </div><div class="t mb27 x64 h22 y1e87 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">recognize themselves as sinners realize they need a Saviour and </div><div class="t m1f0 x64 h22 y1fc5 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">become dismayed at the thought of being eternally separated from </div><div class="t m163f x64 h22 y8d8 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">God.

But as they began their task, </div><div class="t m1181 x64 h22 y1b37 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the stacks crumbled. All that remained were 30 coats of paint applied </div><div class="t m623 x64 h22 y172b ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">over the decades. The 3/4-inch steel that had formed the stacks had </div><div class="t m283 x64 h22 y160d ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">completely rusted away. The Pharisees&apos; religion was much like those </div><div class="t m8d2 x64 h22 ydcf ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">smokestacks; their profession like the 30 coats of paint.
