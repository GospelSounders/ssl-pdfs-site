In a few minutes the plane circled the tiny </div><div class="t m7f8 x16 h27 y2aad ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">jungle landing strip to announce its approach. By the time it landed, </div><div class="t m354 x71 h27 y228f ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the entire village had gathered to greet the visitors. </div><div class="t m775 x74 h27 y231c ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">But Pastor Davai did not recognize anyone in the crowd. &quot;Can </div><div class="t m40a x71 h27 y737 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">you tell me if there are Seventh-day Adventists here?&quot; he asked. </div><div class="t m29e x74 h27 y1c10 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;What are Seventh-day Adventists?&quot; one man replied. During </div><div class="t m44a x71 h27 yed9 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the conversation that followed, Pastor Davai and the pilot learned </div><div class="t m443 x71 h27 y65c ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that they had landed at the village of Tawa instead of their in-</div><div class="t ma28 x71 h27 y1731 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tended destination. Before they climbed back into the plane, Pastor </div><div class="t mf31 x71 h27 y14d4 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Davai asked, &quot;May we return sometime to visit you?&quot; </div><div class="t m1355 x74 h27 y149e ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Yes, you are welcome to return,&quot; the villagers answered. </div><div class="t m168b x74 h27 yacf ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Several months later a man entered the mission office and asked </div><div class="t m9a4 x71 h27 y1026 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">if he could speak to &quot;the big fella.&quot; He was shown into Pastor </div><div class="t mea x71 h27 y12b0 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Davai&apos;s office. As they talked, Pastor Davai realized that the man </div><div class="t mebe x71 h27 y97e ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">had come from the village of Tawa. </div><div class="t m143b x74 h27 yb0e ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;How did you know where to find us?&quot; Pastor Davai asked.
