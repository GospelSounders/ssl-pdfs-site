She </div><div class="t m9a1 x26 h22 y2c56 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">may have retired from teaching school, but not from teaching </div><div class="t m5c9 x18 h22 y29df ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">others about Christ. Born into a Christian family, her father and </div><div class="t m7db x18 h22 y213b ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">uncle were among the first to become Adventists in her home </div><div class="t m1bbe x18 h22 y1f33 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">village. She married and bore six children before her husband died </div><div class="t me71 x18 h22 y21d7 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">at age 28. </div><div class="t m3a6 x64 h22 y204e ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Wu Lan taught school in a remote mountain area to support her </div><div class="t m9d0 x18 h22 y99c ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">young family, retiring in 1979 to devote her time to working for </div><div class="t m12d6 x18 h22 y1511 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">he Lord in her community. And her efforts have born fruit in </div><div class="t m30b x18 h22 y2179 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tremendous growth in the Adventist church in that area. </div><div class="t m101 x64 h22 y1ca3 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">She moved to an area where she was the only Adventist. She </div><div class="t m55f x18 h22 y16e0 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">began worships in her home. Soon neighbors began to join her for </div><div class="t m383 x18 h22 y765 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">worship. Within a year more than 100 people were attending the </div><div class="t m1abf x18 h22 y100f ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">house church. </div><div class="t m687 x64 h22 y160f ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">People began asking for Bible studies and baptism. This pre-</div><div class="t m26b x18 h22 y1949 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sented a problem, for there were no Adventist pastors or elders in </div><div class="t m38b x18 h22 y29d ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the area. The only pastors authorized to baptize were from the </div><div class="t m758 x18 h22 y500 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">official Three-Self church. And baptism by one of these pastors </div><div class="t mdef x18 h22 y5c3 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">meant joining the Three-Self church. </div><div class="t m264 x29 h22 y1ce0 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">After prayerful searching, Wu Lan decided to baptize them </div><div class="t m4f x18 h22 y2063 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">herself. So far Sister Wu has baptized more than 800 people into </div><div class="t m16a7 x4a h22 y17c ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the Seventh-day Adventist Church. She has established six churches, </div><div class="t m37e x4a h22 yc72 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">including one with about 500 members in the next province, and </div><div class="t m1e8 x18 h22 ycee ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">more than 10 house worship groups in the area, </div><div class="t m404 x29 h22 yadb ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The church in Sister Wu&apos;s area has continued to grow in size </div><div class="t mec5 x4a h22 y985 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and strength, and now has more than 2,000 members. Four laymen </div><div class="t m733 x4a h22 y1afd ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">have been trained and ordained as local elders, and another 12 </div><div class="t m115b x4a h22 yf5e ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">have trained to become deacons.

But so far she has not slowed down in her </div><div class="t m172a x4a h22 y17a1 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">work for God. </div><div class="t m190c x5f h22 yd7d ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;I don&apos;t pay any attention to what people say.
