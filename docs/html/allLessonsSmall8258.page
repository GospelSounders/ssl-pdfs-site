Yet here </div><div class="t m97 x15 he y20c0 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">again the innate self-interest of mankind militates against high ideals, and </div><div class="t m386 x15 he y955 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">violent clashes all too often occur. </div><div class="t m3e6 x4a he y160a ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">It is for these reasons that the apostle, looking forward to our time, ad-</div><div class="t m9d2 x27 he ydd8 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">monishes the children of God to &quot;be patient . . . unto the coming of the </div><div class="t ma3b x15 he y15f8 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Lord.&quot; It is the part of the Christian to live like his Master, to manifest His </div><div class="t m1358 x15 he y15af ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">spirit, to keep himself unspotted from the world.
