She began reading the </div><div class="t m78e x71 h22 y2a14 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Bible and found many references to the Sabbath. But which day </div><div class="t m64a x71 h22 y213b ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was Sabbath? The Christians she knew celebrate Jesus&apos; crucifixion </div><div class="t m13b1 x71 h22 y223f ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">on Friday, so the Sabbath should be on Saturday. But why then did </div><div class="t m143b x71 h22 y21d7 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">they worship on Sunday instead of Sabbath? she wondered. </div><div class="t m625 x74 h22 y1f11 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">She knew that somewhere there must be people who live ac-</div><div class="t mb06 x71 h22 y1f0b ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">cording to the principles of God&apos;s law. But how could she find </div><div class="t m682 x71 h22 y20d3 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">them? She kept praying that God would show her His truth. </div><div class="t mcdd x74 h22 y12ed ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Her family greeted her questions with indifference and even </div><div class="t m469 x71 h22 y1c9a ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">animosity. &quot;You should not be reading this book! Why can&apos;t you </div><div class="t m1662 x71 h22 y1503 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">be satisfied with the church you grew up in?&quot; they asked her. But </div><div class="t m1169 x71 h22 y1383 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">their comments failed to deter her in her search for God. </div><div class="t m1642 x74 h22 y1c9b ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Biruthe&apos;s search for truth continued several months. She learned </div><div class="t mec7 x71 h22 y1334 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that God expected His followers to return a tithe of their income to </div><div class="t m40b x71 h22 ycd2 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">God. She thought, I </div><div class="t ma29 x2d h2c y1369 ff6 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">want to pay tithe, but to whom shall I pay it? </div><div class="t m309 x61 h22 y1139 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">When she heard of evangelistic meetings being held in her city, </div><div class="t m19f9 x71 h22 ye9e ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">she decided to attend. Perhaps these people knew where to find the </div><div class="t m19e1 x71 h22 y1089 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">true church. She arrived at the lecture hall early the first night. She </div><div class="t m31c x71 h22 y1f38 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was impressed with the friendliness and humility of the women </div><div class="t mf2f x26 h22 y141b ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">who greeted her. The preacher&apos;s words were warm, and his mes-</div><div class="t me6a x26 h22 y12f9 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sage was backed by texts from the Bible. She could almost hear </div><div class="t m149b x26 h22 y1e25 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">God saying, &quot;Here are the people whom I told you to look for!&quot; </div><div class="t m37e x61 h22 y10eb ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">When the preacher presented the Sabbath, she nearly jumped </div><div class="t ma28 x26 h22 yc7c ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">from her seat, for she knew she had found God&apos;s true church. And </div><div class="t m1362 x26 h22 y1657 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">when the pastor invited those who wanted to follow Jesus to stand, </div><div class="t m63b x26 h22 y1bfc ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Birhute was the first to her feet.

The doctors </div><div class="t mb64 x26 h22 y1144 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">told her the redness and itching she was experiencing could not be </div><div class="t mec6 x26 h22 y1d9d ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">treated but would continue the rest of her life. She found it difficult </div><div class="t m5b1 x26 h22 y1cbc ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to read her Bible and begged God to heal her so she could again </div><div class="t m37 x26 h22 y13c6 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">read her Bible. That night she dreamed that a doctor put a certain </div><div class="t m220 x26 h22 y11b4 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">oil on her eyes. The next day she bought the oil and applied it. </div><div class="t m691 x18 h22 ye6a ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Within a week her eyes were clear.
