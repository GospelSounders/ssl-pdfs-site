It must be admitted that the letter was well written and would prob-</div><div class="t m74b x27 h4 y1fb4 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ably accomplish what was intended. The motive which prompted them in </div><div class="t m811 x27 h4 y1de9 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">writing it, however, must be entirely condemned. Not being permitted to help </div><div class="t m8a8 x27 h4 y62a ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in the building of the city, they now showed that they would go to any length </div><div class="t m2d5 x27 h4 y1f8c ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to cause as much harm as possible.

Thus the work was stopped until the second.year of </div><div class="t m86b x15 h4 y143f ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the reign of Darius, a period of perhaps less than two years.
