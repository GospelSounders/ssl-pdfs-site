So they might ask, &quot;God, why are You so upset when we do some </div><div class="t m6bf x74 h28 y20a1 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">things we want to do rather than what You tell us to do? Can&apos;t we just </div><div class="t mf34 x74 h28 ycfa ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">have a little bit of independence and freedom of action?&quot; </div><div class="t m9f1 x4e h28 yf1c ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Number three in our list is &quot;Wherein have we polluted thee?&quot; &quot;Just </div><div class="t mb3b x74 h28 y2028 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">bless us, Lord, as we bring ourselves and our offerings,&quot; we may be say-</div><div class="t m67c x74 h28 yd51 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ing. &quot;Accept what we give and be thankful for what we are doing.

We go to camp meeting, and they really try to drag the money </div><div class="t m150c x73 h28 yf43 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">out of us. We are tired of all these calls for offerings, Lord. This tithe busi-</div><div class="t m190e x73 h28 y935 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ness is completely unrealistic in the kind of world in which we live. We can </div><div class="t m10ff x73 h28 y1267 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">hardly make ends meet these days.
