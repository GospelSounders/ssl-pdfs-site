Until the last </div><div class="t m6ac x17 h4 yaca ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">they had not believed that He would die; they could hardly believe that He </div><div class="t m995 x17 h4 yca6 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was really dead.

Death by the cross was a lingering process; it </div><div class="t m3d3 x16 h4 yd2c ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was difficult to determine when life had ceased.
