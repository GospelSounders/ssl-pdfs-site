But </div><div class="t mb10 x71 h28 y1b55 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Adriano had found something that he could not deny, and he </div><div class="t m791 x71 h28 y2002 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">held fast to his faith. He sang in a choir that traveled to other </div><div class="t m19e x71 h28 ycd ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">towns to witness for the church.
