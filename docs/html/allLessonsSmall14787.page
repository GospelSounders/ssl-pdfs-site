It was true even of Adam and Eve that their </div><div class="t m1647 xda h35 yd2 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">environment preceded them. Nor are individuals responsible for their </div><div class="t m2e9 xda h35 y14c ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">own existence. </div><div class="t mc35 x11 h35 y20e ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The Bible points to God as the originator of the world and of the life </div><div class="t m492 xc4 h35 y1217 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">it contains.

We are in charge of these goods, and the question that con-</div><div class="t mf38 xc4 h35 yda ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">fronts every responsible person is: To whose benefit shall these goods be </div><div class="t m11dd xc4 h35 y379 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">used?
