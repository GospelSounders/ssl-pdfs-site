What incident familiar to His hearers did He </div><div class="t mcfa x18 h2d ye74 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">cite as an object lesson? Matt. 21:42; Ps. 118:22. </div><div class="t mf63 x29 h2d y17f0 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">NOTE.—&quot;In quoting the prophecy of the rejected stone, Christ re-</div><div class="t m165e x4a h2d y29e ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ferred to an actual occurrence in the history of Israel. The incident was </div><div class="t m40d x4a h2d y1b8a ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">connected with the building of the first temple. While it had a special </div><div class="t ma28 x18 h2d yb31 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">application at the time of Christ&apos;s first advent, and should have appealed </div><div class="t m74e x4a h2d y186c ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">with special force to the Jews, it has also a lesson for us. When the </div><div class="t mf32 x18 h2d y337 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">temple of Solomon was erected, the immense stones for the walls and </div><div class="t m40e x18 h2d yb34 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the foundation were entirely prepared at the quarry; after they were </div><div class="t mcd x18 h2d y1df6 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">brought to the place of building, not an instrument was to be used upon </div><div class="t m386 x18 h2d y176d ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">them; the workmen had only to place them in position. For use in the </div><div class="t m3f x4a h2d y6a6 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">foundation, one stone of unusual size and peculiar shape had been </div><div class="t m3d5 x4a h2d y168c ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">brought; ut the workmen could find no place for it, and would not </div><div class="t m771 x18 h2d y189a ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">accept it. It was an annoyance to them as it lay unused in their way. </div><div class="t m44c x18 h2d yc5e ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Long it remained a rejected stone. But when the builders came to the </div><div class="t mb42 x18 h2d y16b8 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">laying of the corner, they searched for a long time to find a stone of </div><div class="t m100 x18 h2d y1e9f ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sufficient size and strength, and of the proper shape, to take that par-</div><div class="t m375 x18 h2d y1851 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ticular place, and bear the great weight which would rest upon it. </div><div class="t mf31 x18 h2d y1747 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Should they make an unwise choice for this important place, the safety </div><div class="t mf8 x18 h2d y422 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of the entire building would be endangered. They must find a stone </div><div class="t md2a x18 h2d y194c ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">capable of resisting the influence of the sun, of frost, and of tempest. </div><div class="t m117c x18 h2d y17d9 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Several stones had at different times been chosen, but under the pressure </div><div class="t mc9 x18 h2d y18ab ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of immense weights they had crumbled to pieces. Others could not bear </div><div class="t m37f x18 h2d yc9f ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the test of the sudden atmospheric changes. But at last attention was </div><div class="t m75b x18 h2d yc63 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">called to the stone so long rejected. It had been exposed to the air, to </div><div class="t md30 x18 h2d y18ba ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sun and storm, without revealing the slightest crack. The builders ex-</div><div class="t m55c x18 h2d y199e ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">amined this stone. It had borne every test but one. If it could bear the </div><div class="t md25 x18 h2d y1717 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">test of severe pressure, they decided to accept it for the corner stone. </div><div class="t m107d x18 h2d y174c ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The trial was made. The stone was accepted, brought to its assigned </div><div class="t me6a x18 h2d y161d ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">position, and found to be an exact fit. In prophetic vision, Isaiah was </div><div class="t m522 x26 h2d y5f2 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">shown that this stone was a symbol of Christ.&quot;—Id., pp. 597, 598. </div><div class="t m1cd x29 h2d y1a56 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">5. </div><div class="t m779 x34 h2d y81 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">To what class does this &quot;tried stone&quot; become a stumblingblock? </div><div class="t mea2 x18 h2d y16a1 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">1 Peter 2:7, 8. </div><div class="t m1d0 x29 h2d y1620 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">6. </div><div class="t m442 x34 h2d y1789 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Where is the true foundation`stone laid?
