Christianity is superior because it is embodied in Jesus </div><div class="t m8a x0 h35 y2318 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Christ. He was superior to Moses, the prophets, and even the angels. The history and </div><div class="t m167a x0 h35 y1035 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">worship of the Old Testament find their meaning and fulfillment in Him. One of the </div><div class="t m36d xb7 h35 ydf0 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">book&apos;s distinctive teachings is that Christ is now our great High Priest. While other </div><div class="t m190c x0 h35 y162d ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">New Testament writers picture Christ as exalted at God&apos;s right hand, and even refer to </div><div class="t mb64 x0 h35 y20c1 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">His intercessory work (Rom. 8:34), nowhere else is Christ&apos;s work as a high priest in the </div><div class="t me54 xb7 h35 yf1d ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">heavenly sanctuary portrayed. </div><div class="t m1312 x92 h35 y922 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The book of Hebrews is usually called an epistle, but it lacks the features with which </div><div class="t m359 xb7 h35 ybae ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ancient letters began. It does, however, end like a letter with its personal notes, • </div><div class="t m437 xb7 h35 yec2 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">greetings, and benediction. </div><div class="t m2c0 x92 h35 y73c ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">In Hebrews 13:22, RSV, the book is called &quot;my word of exhortation.&quot; Among the </div><div class="t m1364 x0 h35 yc6b ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Jews &quot;word of exhortation&quot; seems to have been a synagogue term for the homily that </div><div class="t md14 xb7 h35 yc01 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">followed the reading of &quot;the law and the prophets.&quot; So the book of Hebrews would </div><div class="t m874 xb7 h35 y1025 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">then be a written sermon; and, since it was sent to a specific group of believers, it is </div><div class="t me4c xb7 h35 ya8b ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">understandable that it should close on a personal note. The emphasis in the book on </div><div class="t m1637 xb7 h35 y1834 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">speaking and hearing (see 2:1, 5; 5:11; 6:9; 11:32) suggests that it was designed to be </div><div class="t m7f3 xb7 h35 y661 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">read aloud to a Christian congregation assembled for worship. </div><div class="t m364 x92 h35 yd57 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The original readers of the epistle were Hebrews. (See </div><div class="t m78e xbf h35 yd57 ff5 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Testimonies, </div><div class="t m1d01 x5 h35 yd57 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">vol. 2, p. 623.) </div><div class="t m107e xb7 h35 y7f1 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The internal evidence of the document indicates that a particular group of Jewish </div><div class="t m98c xb7 h35 y1275 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Christians is being addressed. In &quot;former days&quot; they had endured abuse, affliction, </div><div class="t m7ef xb7 h35 y92e ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and the plundering of their property for their faith. (See Heb. 10:32-34.) It is clear that </div><div class="t m1c9 xb7 h35 y1179 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the writer had previously visited their community (13:19) and hoped to revisit them </div><div class="t m55b xb7 h35 yf30 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">soon (13:23). </div><div class="t m82d x15 h35 y1075 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Who was the author? The epistle does not give his name, but Paul has been </div><div class="t m4d0 xb7 h35 yd24 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">traditionally regarded as the author. However, from early Christian times until the </div><div class="t ma34 xb7 h35 ya49 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">present there has been strong opposition to attributing the epistle to Paul. The </div><div class="t m7e6 xb7 h35 yb7e ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">literary differences between Hebrews and the books known to be written by Paul </div><div class="t m1cd xb7 h35 ya95 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">support this opposition. However, these differences could have resulted from </div><div class="t m68f xb7 h35 y74a ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Timothy, or another of Paul&apos;s colaborers doing the actual writing at Paul&apos;s direction </div><div class="t ma22 xb7 h35 y9bc ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">or by writing down his sermon. Ellen G. White, in alluding to passages from Hebrews, </div><div class="t mf6f xb7 h35 y4b3 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">repeatedly attributes them to Paul. For example, see </div><div class="t ma2b x9 h35 y102b ff5 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The Great Controversy, </div><div class="t m153c x1b4 h35 y102b ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">pp. 411, </div><div class="t m117c xb7 h35 yd60 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">415, 420. </div><div class="t mb55 x15 h35 y864 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">These believers were in grave danger of giving up their Christian faith and reverting </div><div class="t m86f xb9 h35 ydff ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to the Jewish beliefs. Evidently they did not yet fully understand the nature of true </div><div class="t m1e4 xb7 h35 ycb1 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Christianity, but they had experienced ostracism from their former friends and rel-</div><div class="t m852 xb7 h35 y14af ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">atives, and severe persecution. In spite of this it was difficult for them to make a </div><div class="t m82e xb9 h35 yd80 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">complete break with their Jewish past. What they needed was to see clearly the </div><div class="t m3ac xb7 h35 ycde ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">incomparable superiority of Christianity as the climax and fulfillment of the Old </div><div class="t m76b xb7 h35 ye6b ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Testament. </div><div class="t med x15 h35 ya1b ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The book of Hebrews also has a vital message for the Christian today. It particularly </div><div class="t m131d xb9 h35 ybbe ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">challenges us to consider Christ&apos;s intercessory work in our behalf. It provides access </div><div class="t mf57 xb9 h35 y756 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to the throne of the universe. There are unlimited resources of grace and power </div><div class="t mce xb9 h35 ybe1 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">available through our High Priest at God&apos;s right hand. The importance of this in-</div><div class="t me8c xb9 h35 ye3a ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tercession is highlighted by the following paragraph: </div><div class="t m1b6 x15 h35 yd4b ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;God&apos;s appointments and grants in our behalf are without limit.
