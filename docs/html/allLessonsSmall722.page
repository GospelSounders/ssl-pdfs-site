This impression would be erroneous. Fellowship </div><div class="t m13c x74 h2f y16ac ff4 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">with God involves consciousness of sin, and its confession with a view </div><div class="t ma4c x74 h2f y176a ff4 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to its removal. This implies obedience to God, which finds its highest </div><div class="t mbe9 x74 h2f y332 ff4 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">expression in love. Love of God and of the brethren excludes love of </div><div class="t m2dd x74 h2f y18fb ff4 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the world, which is passing away, as is shown by the appearance of </div><div class="t m699 x74 h2f y19a3 ff4 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">antichrists. He who would not pass away must abide in Christ. With </div><div class="t m4d5 x74 h2f y5ec ff4 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the idea of sonship, introduced by the expression &quot;begotten of God,&quot; the </div><div class="t m13a1 x74 h2f y127 ff4 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">epistle takes a fresh start. This divine sonship implies mutual love </div><div class="t m1ac x73 h2f y18a6 ff4 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">among God&apos;s children and the indwelling of Christ, to which the Spirit </div><div class="t m3a0 x74 h2f y197f ff4 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">testifies. The mention of the Spirit leads on to the distinction between </div><div class="t m15a3 x73 h2f y6a3 ff4 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">true and false spirits. By a rather subtle connection this once more </div><div class="t m357 x74 h2f y16ce ff4 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">leads to the topic of mutual love, and to faith as the source of love, es-</div><div class="t m69b x74 h2f y181a ff4 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">pecially as shown in intercessory prayer. The whole closes with a sum-</div><div class="t m7bf x73 h2f y158e ff4 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">mary of the knowledge on which the moral principles inculcated in the </div><div class="t m33e x73 h2f y92 ff4 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">epistle are based, and with a warning against idols. </div><div class="t md06 x36 h2f y19a5 ff4 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The main characteristics of this epistle, says Barnes, are these: 1. It is </div><div class="t m3c2 x74 h2f yb9d ff4 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">full of love. The writer dwells on it; places it in a variety of attitudes; </div><div class="t m16d x73 h2f y1850 ff4 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">enforces the duty of loving one another by a great variety of considera-</div><div class="t m62a x73 h2f y1591 ff4 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tions, and shows that it is essential to the very nature of religion. 2. The </div><div class="t me7a x73 h2f y1851 ff4 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">epistle abounds with statements on the evidences of piety, or the char-</div><div class="t m4f0 x73 h2f y368 ff4 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">acteristics of true religion. . . . A large part of the epistle is occupied </div><div class="t m6b3 x73 h2f y17a2 ff4 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">with this, and there is perhaps no portion of the New Testament which </div><div class="t m118e x73 h2f y1852 ff4 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">one could study to more advantage who is desirous of ascertaining </div><div class="t m1452 x73 h2f y236 ff4 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">whether he himself is a true Christian. An anxious inquirer, a man </div><div class="t m593 x73 h2f y2c5 ff4 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">who wishes to know what true religion is, could be directed to no portion </div><div class="t mf3 x73 h2f y1b42 ff4 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of the New Testament where he would more readily find the instruction </div><div class="t m480 x73 h2f y424 ff4 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that he needs, than to this portion of the writings of the aged and ex-</div><div class="t m233 x73 h2f y18f0 ff4 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">perienced disciple whom Jesus loved. A true Christian can find no-</div><div class="t me5 x73 h2f y189d ff4 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">where else a more clear statement of the nature of his religion, and of </div><div class="t m270 x73 h2f y5dc ff4 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the evidences of real piety, than in this epistle. </div><div class="t ma24 x68 h1 yc65 ff1 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">NOTE. </div><div class="t m2d8 x29 h2f y1664 ff4 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The portion of Scripture designated for each lesson should be so thor-</div><div class="t m3e8 x73 h2f y19ec ff4 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">oughly studied that every question can be answered </div><div class="t m626 x9 h1b y13e ff6 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in the exact words of </div><div class="t m1144 x73 h1b y172f ff6 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the text. </div><div class="t m10c x59 h2f yba8 ff4 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The questions are framed with the purpose to make this possi• </div><div class="t mad7 x74 h2f y191a ff4 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ble.
