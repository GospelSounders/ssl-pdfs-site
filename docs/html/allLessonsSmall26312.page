He stopped to listen, and someone invited </div><div class="t m21ce x26 h27 y1f37 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">him in. The building was an Adventist church. </div><div class="t m56c x64 h27 y1434 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Someone gave Pan a hymnal, and that gift changed his life. Pan </div><div class="t m1756 x26 h27 y1fc9 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">taught himself to read so he could learn the hymns. When he found a </div><div class="t m46b x26 h27 y15de ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">word he didn&apos;t know he circled it and later asked someone what the </div><div class="t m997 x26 h27 y1482 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">word meant. Pan literally sang himself into the Adventist Church. </div><div class="t m188c x64 h27 y12f0 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">One day Pan was so engrossed in a gospel tract that he forgot about </div><div class="t m107d x26 h27 y1c39 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the sheep. When he looked up the sheep were gone! Pan began </div><div class="t m15c0 x26 h27 y1e07 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">searching for the sheep. The sky grew dark with rain clouds, and still </div><div class="t me6c x18 h27 y1f13 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Pan had not found the sheep. </div><div class="t m163d x3a h16 y1f13 ff6 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">How could I let my sheep wander away? </div><div class="t m99a x26 h27 y203b ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">he chastened himself. </div><div class="t m153c x64 h27 y1529 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Then Pan remembered that God knows everything. He knelt and </div><div class="t m1c90 x18 h27 yd3a ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">prayed, &quot;Lord, have mercy on me.

Not one was missing! Pan returned to the village </div><div class="t m1c90 x18 h27 y1d92 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and eagerly told others what had happened. </div><div class="t ma90 x64 h27 y104f ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Pan&apos;s faith in God grew, and he was baptized. He loved to share his </div><div class="t m1713 x18 h27 y1cd1 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">faith with others, and the Adventist church encouraged him to study </div><div class="t mea x18 h27 yea5 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">theology and become a pastor. But Pan ran into difficulties at the </div><div class="t m1a1d x18 h27 y1d7d ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">government-operated seminary. Students teased him about worshiping </div><div class="t m2362 x18 h27 y10f3 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">on the Sabbath and refusing to eat pork. Teachers often gave tests on </div><div class="t md71 x18 h27 y1d3d ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Sabbath, and Pan&apos;s Sabbath absences from class eventually led to his </div><div class="t m1347 x18 h27 y10fd ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">dismissal. But God provided a way for him to continue attending </div><div class="t m1304 x18 h27 y14a1 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">classes. He never received a diploma for his work at the seminary, but </div><div class="t m136d x18 h27 yd61 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Pan knew that Jesus&apos; disciples had no diplomas either. </div><div class="t mf42 x64 h27 y15c2 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Pan returned to his mountain home and started preaching.
