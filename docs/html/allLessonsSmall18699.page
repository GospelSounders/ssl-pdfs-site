Thus have many of us prayed from our earliest </div><div class="t m6e5 x28 h2d y4be ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">years, learning to say the words before we could understand them. </div><div class="t mcff x28 h2d y14a ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">And still we fail to sense their full meaning for us, without a doubt. </div><div class="t m3e1 x66 h2d y557 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Behind the familiar words of the Lord&apos;s Prayer lie the age-long </div><div class="t md8 x28 h2d yd4 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">conflict between Christ and Satan. All the relationships of the in-</div><div class="t m2d2 x28 h2d y1ca ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">habitants of the universe are involved. And on our small planet </div><div class="t m83b x28 h2d y621 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the way has been provided for those who will to return to seeking </div><div class="t m2bf x28 h2d ya25 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the glory of God. </div><div class="t m87a x66 h2d yfdc ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Satan&apos;s rebellion in heaven was the first challenge to the heart of </div><div class="t m678 x28 h2d y285 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">God&apos;s glory—to His character which reveals His perfect selfless love. </div><div class="t mcdb x28 h2d y485 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">During this quarter we will seek to define God&apos;s glory, see it in the </div><div class="t m24f x4e h2d y34b ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">person of God, see it in the face of Jesus. We will see how man lost his </div><div class="t m9d7 x4e h2d y179 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">reflection of God&apos;s glory in Eden. </div><div class="t m367 x66 h2d ya82 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">We will see the cross providing the way back to God, the way to </div><div class="t m313 x4e h2d y1d4 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">seek His glory rather than our own. Restoration full and complete is </div><div class="t m145e x28 h2d y438 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">contemplated. We will consider the means and agencies that God has </div><div class="t m36e x4e h2d y2bb ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">provided for this purpose.

The home is one of the places where we </div><div class="t m7a5 x4e h2d y8f8 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">too often forget. God wants those homes restored to seeking His </div><div class="t mdc x4e h2d y303 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">glory. </div><div class="t m7f3 x63 h2d y219 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">From the Scriptures, we will note that God&apos;s people through the </div><div class="t m362 x4e h2d y351 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ages have been seeking His glory, some more earnestly than others. </div><div class="t m1194 x4e h2d y368 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">But only He knows the many who were faithful though unrecorded in </div><div class="t m568 x4e h2d y4d7 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the Word. He is looking for the final triumph of the remnant people as </div><div class="t m8bc x4e h2d y320 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the controversy between good and evil sweeps to its climax. The </div><div class="t m1065 x4e h2d ya62 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">cross provides for victory all the way. And soon the glory—in the </div><div class="t md02 x4e h2d y1de ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sense of awe, majesty, and power—of the advent will signal the close </div><div class="t m76d x4e h2d y4ef ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of the conflict.
