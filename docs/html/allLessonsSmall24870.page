But instead of a welcome, the villagers told the two </div><div class="t m7d8 x16 h28 y2423 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">pastors to leave. However the mission plane had already left and </div><div class="t m1065 x3e h28 y21bc ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">would not return for five days. After praying for God&apos;s guidance, </div><div class="t m19a x16 h28 y2 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Pastor Nick spoke to the shouting crowd. &quot;I&apos;m sorry that our </div><div class="t m992 x16 h28 y1c1d ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">coming has upset you,&quot; he said. &quot;We don&apos;t know what to do.

Soon </div><div class="t m1ce x16 h28 y13df ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the village leaders returned. &quot;You can stay,&quot; they said. &quot;We will </div><div class="t m304 x16 h28 y9e2 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">prepare a house for you.
