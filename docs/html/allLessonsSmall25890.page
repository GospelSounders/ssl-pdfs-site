After escaping from prison, he and two former gang members </div><div class="t m14a3 x16 h27 y2436 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">fled into the jungle. As Abel thought about his past, he decided that </div><div class="t m161c x16 h27 y2381 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">they needed to change their lives. It was not safe to visit the church in </div><div class="t ma2a x16 h27 y2333 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the valley, so the men built their own church. </div><div class="t m670 x73 h27 yca5 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;What do we do now that we have a church?&quot; one man asked. </div><div class="t mac0 x73 h27 y1475 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;We will hold services on Saturday, as the Adventists in prison </div><div class="t m1c7d x16 h27 y2d3 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">did,&quot; Abel answered.

After worship he invited the youth to come every week. They </div><div class="t m1abc x71 h27 yaee ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">happily agreed. </div><div class="t m105 x74 h27 yd72 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The following Sabbath, when the students had not arrived by </div><div class="t mebe x71 h27 yd3c ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">11:00, Abel was worried.

He </div><div class="t m14b6 x71 h27 y120d ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">fired shots into the air, frightening the villagers who ran for cover. </div><div class="t med x71 h27 y726 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">When Abel arrived at the school, the gate was padlocked.

When </div><div class="t m1bbe x71 h27 y1103 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">he found the man, Abel aimed his rifle at the man&apos;s head. </div><div class="t m19ee x74 h27 ye11 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;What do you want?&quot; the principal stammered. </div><div class="t m328 x74 h27 y74e ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Let the Adventist young people come to my church!&quot; Abel </div><div class="t m246 x71 h27 yd62 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ordered. The principal agreed, and the youth again worshiped with </div><div class="t m147 x71 h27 yee8 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the three men in the jungle chapel. The Holy Spirit softened their </div><div class="t m3f1 x71 h27 y14a4 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">hearts, and the three men surrendered their lives to God. </div><div class="t m15b8 x74 h27 yb87 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Soon the little bush chapel was too small to hold all the people </div><div class="t m665 x71 h27 y12b7 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">who wanted to worship there.
