The new curriculum will take us through </div><div class="t m1ce x48 h28 y20fe ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">every book of the Bible in the next ten years and will concentrate on </div><div class="t maf7 x48 h28 y3b8 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">showing how each Bible book meets current human needs. The new for-</div><div class="t mc9 x48 h28 y191 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">mat is designed to foster deeper Bible study.
