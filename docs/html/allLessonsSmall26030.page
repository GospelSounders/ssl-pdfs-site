I&apos;ve been trying to call you for two months!&quot; </div><div class="t m51e x28 h28 y1fb8 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Larisa Cholopova had first heard of Michael several months </div><div class="t m8a8 x5d h28 y6dd ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">before when she was examining records at a factory. One of the </div><div class="t mf3 x14 h28 yca6 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">workers there had told her that a former Komsomol leader had </div><div class="t m1f5 x5d h28 y833 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">quit his job to become a Christian. The news had surprised Larisa. </div><div class="t m881 x5d h28 yd91 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">She wondered what could have made the man quit a steady job to </div><div class="t m1e7 x5d h28 ybfe ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">become a Christian. The factory worker offered to introduce Larisa </div><div class="t m6af x5d h28 ye44 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to the former Komsomol leader, so Larisa left her name and </div><div class="t m36d x5d h28 ye0a ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">telephone number. </div><div class="t m2f9 x28 h28 y927 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">But before she could meet the man, Larisa became seriously ill </div><div class="t m1329 x5d h28 y7ab ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and was hospitalized. A friend visited her in the hospital and told </div><div class="t ma08 x5d h28 y83b ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">her about a study group she was attending. The study group </div><div class="t m98c x5d h28 y1175 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sounded interesting, so when Larisa was strong enough, she went. </div><div class="t mcf2 x5d h28 yf2a ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">It was at this meeting that she met Michael. At first Larisa had </div><div class="t mdc8 x5d h28 y744 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">argued nearly every point the group discussed. But as she became </div><div class="t ma46 x5d h28 y106b ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">better acquainted with the members of the group, she found that </div><div class="t m12d6 x5d h28 ybb5 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Christianity made sense. </div><div class="t m242 x4e h28 y120c ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Larisa&apos;s health problems persisted. When the doctors gave her </div><div class="t ma45 x5d h28 ye32 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">a grim prognosis, she accepted it as God&apos;s punishment for her past </div><div class="t m73d x5d h28 y824 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">deeds. But she asked her Christian friends to pray for her. </div><div class="t m4c4 x4e h28 yaef ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Some members of the study group invited Larisa to evangelis-</div><div class="t mb0f x5d h28 y986 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tic meetings being held in nearby Tashkent. She went with them </div><div class="t m781 x5d h28 yece ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and felt the Holy Spirit touch her heart. She responded to the call </div><div class="t mf1 x5d h28 yd5f ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to follow Christ. Later when she returned to the doctor, her blood </div><div class="t m99 x48 h28 y109f ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tests came back negative. God had not only healed her soul, but </div><div class="t m300 x48 h28 yf45 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">her body as well. </div><div class="t m33c x4e h28 yae3 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Larisa accepted God&apos;s call to study theology, and today she </div><div class="t m20d x48 h28 y12d9 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">serves as women&apos;s ministries director in a largely Muslim region </div><div class="t mbb5 x48 h28 yd27 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of the former Soviet Union.
