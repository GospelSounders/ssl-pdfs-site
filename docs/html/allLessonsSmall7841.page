What was the </div><div class="t mf3d x17 h4 y509 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">duty of the priests? Verse 11; Mal. 2:7. </div><div class="t m607 x5d h4 y818 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Norn.—The people had a right to expect the priests to know the law, &quot;for </div><div class="t ma44 x17 h4 y718 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the priest&apos;s lips should keep knowledge, and they should seek the law at his </div><div class="t ma69 x17 h4 y88f ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">mouth.&quot; Mal. 2:7. The reason given for this is that he &quot;is the messenger of </div><div class="t m3df x17 h4 y6c9 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the Lord of hosts.&quot; This puts a great responsibility upon the minister. He is </div><div class="t m4ca x17 h4 y538 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">expected to know the law. </div><div class="t m2b6 x48 h4 yf87 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">3. </div><div class="t m753 x4e h4 yf87 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">What was the question asked of the priests?

Haggai 2:12. </div><div class="t m76e x5d h4 y1975 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">NOTE.—Certain offerings were eaten by the priests, &quot;in the holy place shall </div><div class="t m576 x17 h4 y580 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">it be eaten, in the court of the tabernacle of the congregation. Whatsoever </div><div class="t m2b0 x11 h4 ya43 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">shall touch the flesh thereof shall be holy.&quot; Lev. 6:26, 27. Only such as were </div><div class="t mb5b x17 h4 y9d8 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ceremonially clean might eat of the flesh or touch it. A priest might take a </div><div class="t mab x11 h4 y212 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">piece of the flesh offered in sacrifice and carry it from one place to another, </div><div class="t m3d5 x17 h4 y19a9 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">perhaps for the purpose of eating it. In thus carrying it he would cover it with </div><div class="t m719 x17 h4 y85b ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the skirt of his garment so that it would touch nothing unclean on the way. </div><div class="t mcf2 x17 h4 y19c ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The garment being holy as well as the flesh, the question was this, that if on </div><div class="t m110a x17 h4 y598 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the way the garment—not the flesh—should touch something eatable, such </div><div class="t m8e x11 h4 y153a ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">as &quot;bread, or pottage, or wine, or oil, or any meat,&quot; would such article be-</div><div class="t m2d4 x17 h4 y2df ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">come holy because it had touched the garment? The priests promptly and </div><div class="t m869 x17 h4 yaac ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">rightly answer no. Holiness is not thus conveyed. While the flesh itself was </div><div class="t m442 x17 h4 yf7d ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">considered holy—in Lev. 6:29 it is called &quot;most holy&quot;—and while the garment </div><div class="t m9b9 x17 h4 y7f9 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">or skirt in which it was carried also was holy, that which the garment touched </div><div class="t m9c6 x17 h4 yb16 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">did not therefore become holy. </div><div class="t ma2 x48 h4 y41a ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">4. </div><div class="t m7d9 x28 h4 ybef ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">What other question was now asked?

A holy thing cannot transmit its holiness, </div><div class="t m6d5 x17 h4 yc3f ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">but a polluted thing can transmit its pollution. Num. 19:22. Sin is more </div><div class="t m44 x17 h4 y1c ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">contagious than righteousness.
