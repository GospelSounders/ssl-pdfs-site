Read Luke 11:5-8. </div><div class="t mdc5 x73 h87 y2983 ff1 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Several customs are apparent in these verses: (1) During hot weather, </div><div class="t m866 x48 h87 y28e4 ff1 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">people often traveled at night. This could explain the midnight hour. </div><div class="t m1b00 x48 h87 y23c6 ff1 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">(2) Hospitality was a sacred duty. But because just enough bread was </div><div class="t m2d74 x48 h87 y239e ff1 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">baked in the morning for one day&apos;s use, the friend could not fulfill this </div><div class="t mebe x73 h87 ydd7 ff1 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">duty. Thus he was faced with quite a predicament. (3) Doors were </div><div class="t m134d x48 h87 y13e1 ff1 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">usually left open during the day. But closing them in the evening </div><div class="t m10ff x73 h87 y1a80 ff1 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">signaled the householder&apos;s desire not to be disturbed. Thus, it was </div><div class="t m873 x48 h87 y166f ff1 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">considered quite rude to knock on a closed door, unless the need was </div><div class="t m1bc9 x48 h87 y20b0 ff1 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">crucial. (4) A Palestinian house was usually divided into two parts by </div><div class="t m1be3 x48 h87 yf20 ff1 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">a low platform that comprised about one-third of the floor space. On </div><div class="t m19db x48 h87 y2056 ff1 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the platform sat a charcoal stove around which the entire family slept </div><div class="t m36d x48 h87 y1958 ff1 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">on mats. If one person arose, it was likely that others would be </div><div class="t m1a0d x48 h87 y16f8 ff1 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">disturbed.

Luke 11:5-13. </div><div class="t m13b1 x60 h87 y1a0 ff1 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Christ is not saying that God is one from whom we must wring a </div><div class="t mde1 x48 h87 y1fa2 ff1 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">blessing.
