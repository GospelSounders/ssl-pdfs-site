Although she </div><div class="t m356 x71 h22 y2a28 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">had become a Christian, she had never let go of her anger and </div><div class="t m1d7f x71 h22 y2462 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">bitterness toward those who wronged her. Her relationship with God </div><div class="t m1892 x26 h22 y2331 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and with others was rooted in legalism rather than love. </div><div class="t m172c x61 h22 y2291 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">In letters to her I encouraged her to look to Jesus for the power to </div><div class="t mcd2 x26 h22 yed8 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">forgive others and love them. And I asked my prayer partners to pray </div><div class="t m166a x26 h22 y832 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">for her. </div><div class="t m1e13 x61 h22 y206e ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Six months later I received a letter from Ruthie.

Instead of bitterness and hatred, her letter was filled with </div><div class="t m19e0 x26 h22 y1cef ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">praise to God. She was living in the same bleak cell, surrounded by the </div><div class="t m305 x26 h22 y564 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">same angry people, yet she had found love and forgiveness in her </div><div class="t mf98 x26 h22 y793 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Friend Jesus. </div><div class="t m8ed x61 h22 y1098 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;I wish I could get out of [prison],&quot; she said, &quot;so I could become a </div><div class="t m2f5 x26 h22 y12ba ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">missionary!&quot; </div><div class="t m1565 x64 h22 yff3 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Rejoicing over the change in Ruthie&apos;s life, I wrote back to her. &quot;Do </div><div class="t m2051 x26 h22 y957 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">you realize that you are in a . . . larger mission field than many of our </div><div class="t meba x26 h22 yd71 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">missionaries?&quot; I shared with her my philosophy that most of us are </div><div class="t m1aed x26 h22 yd3b ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">already in the mission field where God wants us to work. </div><div class="t m2e80 x64 h22 yd20 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Ruthie&apos;s letters sparkle with hope and joy in Jesus.
