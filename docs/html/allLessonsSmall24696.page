Her friend had invited her and </div><div class="t m46a x71 h28 y2131 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">told her about the fun she would have singing songs, learning Bible </div><div class="t m101 x71 h28 y1ad2 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">verses, and making crafts. Although her parents were not religious, </div><div class="t m7d5 x71 h28 y22b6 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">they thought it would be good for her to have something special to </div><div class="t mad3 xe4 h22 y2307 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">do </div><div class="t m468 x71 h28 y2009 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">during vacation, so they gave her permission to attend the program. </div><div class="t mea5 x61 h28 y831 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Margarita loved Vacation Bible School, and the teachers loved </div><div class="t m646 x26 h28 ydd9 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">her.
