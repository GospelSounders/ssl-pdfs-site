Jesus will take His beloved—including those who </div><div class="t m64b x48 h28 y2945 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">have died and are resurrected when He comes—to heaven with Him.

Second, </div><div class="t m73a x73 h28 y1311 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Paul holds out hope for those who die in Christ.
