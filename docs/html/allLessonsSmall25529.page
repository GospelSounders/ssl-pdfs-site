Jer. 31:3. </div><div class="t m243 xc h28 y237a ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">True love does not forget.

Gifts of counsel are often of greater value than any other </div><div class="t m654 x74 h28 y3fe ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">gifts. They cannot be measured in terms of material value, although at </div><div class="t m60f x74 h28 y484 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">times they are of the highest material value.
