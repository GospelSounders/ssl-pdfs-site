He </div><div class="t m147a x11 h27 y2026 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">traveled to Bucharest to buy 105 more Bibles, so each home would </div><div class="t mbca x11 h27 y1987 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">have one. </div><div class="t m83b x14 h27 y16df ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">While in Mari, two men from Veda, a neighboring village, </div><div class="t m446 x11 h27 y19e5 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">came to see Butoy. &quot;Please bring Bibles to our village too,&quot; they </div><div class="t mbc6 x11 h27 y1fd0 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">pleaded.

A few months later Butoy and </div><div class="t mb41 x11 h27 y29e ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">his cousins returned to Veda with Bibles for every family. </div><div class="t m1308 x5d h27 y379 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">While visiting the homes, they met the Orthodox priest.
