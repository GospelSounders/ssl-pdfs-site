It was not easy to gather the natives together, and </div><div class="t m109 x29 h4 ya38 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">especially was it difficult to have a regular attendance. One did not </div><div class="t m396 x29 h4 y1737 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">dare record the names of those attending a Sabbath school session, </div><div class="t m13e x64 h4 y1722 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">for they would not return again, thinking that their names had been </div><div class="t m3ce x64 h4 y158b ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">taken to be given to the administrative authorities of the government. </div><div class="t m5e1 x6f h4 y121 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">We are truly thankful to God that conditions have now changed. </div><div class="t m2a4 x64 h4 y177f ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">To-day we may enroll the names of the natives as well as mark their </div><div class="t mb0e x64 h4 y183a ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">attendance. Several persons have given their names of their own </div><div class="t m600 x64 h4 y1a10 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">accord, and have made request to be enrolled in the baptismal class. </div><div class="t m8df x64 h4 ya57 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">We now have more than one hundred natives in this class. </div><div class="t m2b1 x6f h4 y1ddd ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Since our arrival in the spring of 1929, we have seen the number </div><div class="t m1ff x64 h4 y1a7a ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of Sabbath school members increase each quarter. At present we </div><div class="t m417 x64 h4 y187d ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">have three Sabbath schools,—one here at Nanga-Eboko ; another a </div><div class="t m7d9 x64 h4 y186d ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">three days&apos; march from here; and the third a day and half&apos;s march </div><div class="t m1be x64 h4 y1756 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">from here.

Several of them can recite all the memory verses for one </div><div class="t m2c2 x64 h4 y17f7 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">quarter by heart. The children are especially interested, and they are </div><div class="t ma8f x64 h4 y24d ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the ones usually who can give the best answers to questions asked </div><div class="t m3e0 x64 h4 y1632 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">by teachers. </div><div class="t m2be x34 h4 y68c ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The work goes slowly, yet there is progress that encourages us </div><div class="t ma4 x64 h4 yf5e ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">greatly. For example, formerly it was difficult to arrest the attention </div><div class="t m3c5 x64 h4 y1861 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of the natives, accustomed as they are to move about at will or to </div><div class="t m3c5 x64 h4 yc5f ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">turn from right to left; but now, almost all fix their gaze upon the </div><div class="t m476 x64 h4 y1de5 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">one who is conducting the lesson.
