They do not </div><div class="t me59 x4a h2d y166e ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">all come from the same Testament. They were written at different times to </div><div class="t m808 x4a h2d y1618 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">meet different circumstances. But there are underlying themes that bring </div><div class="t m400 x4a h2d y680 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">these different books together to meet our needs for today. They teach us to </div><div class="t m3c0 x4a h2d y349 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">lay aside selfishness in full and loving commitment to God&apos;s will for us. </div><div class="t mae7 x4a h2d y1ba5 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">They also demonstrate clearly that in doing so we will enjoy the abundant </div><div class="t m6a3 x4a h2d yc1a ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">life. </div><div class="t ma24 x64 h2d y847 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Such an experience is far removed from righteousness by works. It is built </div><div class="t m9d x14 h2d y1e90 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">upon a loving, confident relationship with our Lord. If we love the Lord </div><div class="t m32b x14 h2d yc92 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">with our whole heart, mind, soul, and strength we will want to demonstrate </div><div class="t m14c1 x4a h2d y164e ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">our love in many practical ways that honor and please Him. In turn we will </div><div class="t m116b x14 h2d y1929 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">discover that we gain all through giving all. Because of our love and appre-</div><div class="t m43e x14 h2d y1bed ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ciation for our Lord, we place all we have and are at His feet. By holding </div><div class="t m1ed x14 h2d y1971 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">back nothing, we gain everything. </div><div class="t md15 x64 h2d ydeb ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">We begin our study this quarter with an introductory lesson on total com-</div><div class="t m1e7 x14 h2d yb37 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">mitment. Then we move into two lessons based on the book of Haggai. This </div><div class="t mde x14 h2d y1d6d ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">book provides a practical demonstration of the fact that it really does pay to </div><div class="t m1db x14 h2d y268 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">cooperate with God. When we do, our total commitment leads to unlimited </div><div class="t m5c5 x14 h2d y269 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">blessings. </div><div class="t mf62 x64 h2d y16e5 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">But what is total commitment in a practical sense? For our answer we turn </div><div class="t mf10 x14 h2d y16e6 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to the primer of practical Christianityâ€”the book of James. The lives of prac-</div><div class="t m1081 x14 h2d y43d ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ticing Christians demonstrate that true faith always produces the rich works </div><div class="t mf4d x14 h2d yc9b ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of love. On the other hand, those who are not committed fully to the Lord </div><div class="t m101 x14 h2d yfa5 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tend to rationalize their unchristian behavior and thus become blind to their </div><div class="t m37d x14 h2d y6b0 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">true condition. Because this was true particularly of the Jewish people in </div><div class="t mcdb x14 h2d y690 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Malachi&apos;s day and is a specific characteristic of the Laodicean church (see </div><div class="t m406 x14 h2d yfa7 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Rev. 3:17), we will conclude this quarter&apos;s study with lessons from the book </div><div class="t m6b x14 h2d y17a5 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of Malachi. In the first three chapters we find God&apos;s loving warnings meet-</div><div class="t m351 x14 h2d y324 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ing with self-righteous denials. Yet, even in the midst of those who pro-</div><div class="t m390 x14 h2d y1cc3 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">nounce themselves weary of religion, there are a few whose names are re-</div><div class="t m9b x14 h2d y16c2 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">corded in &quot;God&apos;s book of remembrance&quot; (Mal. 3:16). The last chapter of </div><div class="t m90 x14 h2d y461 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Malachi draws a clear contrast between the fate of the righteous and that of </div><div class="t m90 x14 h2d yb52 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the wicked. This last book of the Old Testament concludes with a prophecy </div><div class="t meb x14 h2d y1cce ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of the final great revival and reformation that will usher in the kingdom of </div><div class="t mec2 x14 h2d y1926 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">God. This constitutes our challenge today. Nothing short of total commit-</div><div class="t md04 x14 h2d y32b ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ment to God&apos;s will and God&apos;s purpose in our lives is worthy of this final </div><div class="t m625 x14 h2d y20b2 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">phase of the drama of the ages. </div></div><div class="pi" data-data='{"ctm":[1.000000,0.000000,0.000000,1.000000,0.000000,0.000000]}'></div></div>
