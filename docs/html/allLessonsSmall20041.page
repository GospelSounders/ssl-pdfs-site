We have great confi-</div><div class="t ma3b x61 h2d y2e87 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">dence in the doctor and all his associates; we have faith that the medicine </div><div class="t m7d0 x61 h2d y2d6e ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">likewise will provide healing. But it is the divinely-directed operation of </div><div class="t m227 x64 h2d y2a2c ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">nature that in the end brings healing. Doctors admit that they have no </div><div class="t m61e x61 h2d y2a18 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">power to cure disease, nor does the medicine they prescribe cure, al-</div><div class="t m61a x61 h2d y2a66 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">though it may assist the healing process. Doctors are instruments in </div><div class="t mb49 x61 h2d y2bfd ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">God&apos;s hand, and it is God&apos;s power that brings healing. Antibiotics can kill </div><div class="t m32e x61 h2d y2131 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">disease germs, but that does not make the patient well. God has to heal </div><div class="t m134 x61 h2d y2331 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the inflamed area and repair the damage. Because the same Greek word </div><div class="t m91b x64 h2d y2194 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">used in the New Testament for &quot;saving&quot; sometimes is used for &quot;healing,&quot; </div><div class="t m86b x61 h2d y1ffb ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">it would be consistent to read the verse this way: &quot;By grace are ye saved </div><div class="t m73f x61 h2d y760 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">[healed] through faith; and that not of yourselves.&quot; </div><div class="t m4c4 x5f h2d y1164 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Salvation, then, is a free gift from God received by means of faith. This </div><div class="t m1a8 x61 h2d y921 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">faith does not originate in us, but it can reside in us and work for us. Paul </div><div class="t m31d x61 h2d yccf ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">says that it is &quot;the operation of God&quot; (Col. 2:12).
