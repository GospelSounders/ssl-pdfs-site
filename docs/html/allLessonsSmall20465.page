Verse 14. </div><div class="t mf4d x66 he y2ba9 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">It is remarkable that Darius should be &quot;sore displeased&quot; with himself rather </div><div class="t m25c x28 he y2bd6 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">than with Daniel. He knew that he had made a mistake. But because Daniel was </div><div class="t md15 x28 he y2b0e ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">his first president the king should have consulted with Daniel before signing the </div><div class="t m1476 x28 he y2c36 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">decree. Because he had been pressured into signing, he had not given the matter </div><div class="t m681 x28 he y28e8 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sufficient thought. Now he was caught in a bind, trapped within the tradition that </div><div class="t m77a x28 he y2389 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the laws of the Medes and the Persians could not be changed. </div><div class="t m40b x6f he y2351 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Darius did everything he could to come up with some way of protecting Dan-</div><div class="t m136a x28 he y48 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">iel. The Scripture says that &quot;he laboured till the going down of the sun to deliver </div><div class="t mcfb x28 he y27d ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">him&quot; (Dan. 6:14). The king consulted with several counselors, hoping to find a </div><div class="t m403 x28 he y88d ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">loophole in the law. But no one could help him. </div><div class="t m8e0 x6f he y3b8 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Finally the pressure group came back. They pointed out that Darius could not </div><div class="t md13 x28 he y386 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">change the terms of the decree. There could be one verdict alone that would fit </div><div class="t m116c x28 he ya2a ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Daniel&apos;s caseâ€”that was to throw Daniel to the mercy of the lions. The king was </div><div class="t md5 x28 he y25e ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">trapped by his own words. He was the captive of a pressure group, a victim of </div><div class="t m9e4 x28 he y1cb ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">national customs and traditions. Reluctantly, but nevertheless effectively, he was </div><div class="t m76c x28 he y2d9 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">forced to issue the command: Daniel was to be thrown to the lions. Darius&apos;s one </div><div class="t mdf x36 he yf8 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">consolation was that he could hope that Daniel&apos;s God would deliver him. </div><div class="t mf49 x6f h1 y5 ff1 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">What does the way that the king spent the rest of that day and night </div><div class="t m781 x36 h1 y583 ff1 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">reveal about the genuineness of his concern? (Dan. 6:18). What did he do </div><div class="t meb x36 h1 y263 ff1 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">early the next morning? (Dan. 6:19, 20). </div><div class="t m4a29 x27 h1c y147f ff2 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">1</div><div class="t me96 x14 h1c y147f ff2 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">1</div><div class="t m1d65 x14 h1c y147f ff2 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">1 </div><div class="t m65f x36 h1 y5b6 ff1 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">III. A LESSON TAUGHT (Dan. 6:21-28). </div><div class="t m1e7 x34 he y9ac ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The story of Daniel&apos;s escape from the lions is a familiar one, but we never tire </div><div class="t m455 x36 he y1fb ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of hearing it rehearsed. Why is that? Is it because of the ending: right prevails </div><div class="t mb91 x36 he y41c ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and wickedness is punished? Or is it because we can identify with Darius and </div><div class="t mf5 x29 he y627 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Daniel? Perhaps it is because we so often see wrong prevailing, and are de-</div><div class="t mcdb x29 he y15c ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">lighted when wrong finally is overthrown. We are sympathetic with the weak-</div><div class="t m1196 x29 he y15d ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ness of Darius, glad for the strength of Daniel, but supremely happy for a God in </div><div class="t m5b0 x29 he y422 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">heaven who can shut the mouths of lions when it is best for His work on earth. </div><div class="t m381 x64 h1 y6c5 ff1 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">54 </div></div><div class="pi" data-data='{"ctm":[1.000000,0.000000,0.000000,1.000000,0.000000,0.000000]}'></div></div>
