Other New Testament writings, such as the </div><div class="t m3c8 x27 h35 y1526 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">letters to the Romans or to the Galatians, emphasize the content of Christian </div><div class="t m245 x27 h35 y1e5d ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">theology and its ethical applications. Rare, however, is the occasion in the Bible </div><div class="t m62a x27 h35 y62c ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">where the nature and problems of evangelical communication are elaborated. </div><div class="t mab2 x4a h35 y1f55 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Christianity is more than mental belief in unique theological doctrines; Chris-</div><div class="t mef x27 h35 y21a3 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tianity is a new way of life that has been made possible by the personal interven-</div><div class="t m9c1 x27 h35 y1e58 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tion of God Himself into the affairs of men and women. </div><div class="t m2c6 x4a h35 y1cf7 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">But who would believe such an unthinkable thought? Only those who had </div><div class="t mddb x27 h35 y1a5b ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">personally met such a Person and discovered that everything He said about </div><div class="t m304 x27 h35 y1959 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">man&apos;s problems, his hopes and fears and weaknesses, was true. More than that, </div><div class="t ma69 x27 h35 y1f9f ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">such people would also discover that His solutions to these fears and weak-</div><div class="t m9d2 x27 h35 y1172 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">nesses really worked and that Jesus, in fact, had the truth and everything He </div><div class="t m6e6 x27 h35 y1d4a ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">said rang true. Wherever His words were relayed, from person to person, from </div><div class="t m5ed x27 h35 y12f5 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">country to country, the same human discoveries were made. Jesus spoke the </div><div class="t m6fb x27 h35 y1c09 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">truth about life, His solutions worked, lives were changed, the awareness of </div><div class="t m477 x27 h35 y1b46 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">more than human help was evident. </div><div class="t m5c3 x4a h35 y1b2f ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">But Jesus met relatively few people in Palestine during His short ministry, and </div><div class="t maf6 x27 h35 y12a ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">fewer yet of this circle actually discovered that He was worth trusting and obey-</div><div class="t m268 x27 h35 y195c ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ing. But those who made the discovery passed it on. They were concerned that </div><div class="t m6a2 x27 h35 y1def ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the facts concerning Jesus, who He was, what He said, how He lived, be kept </div><div class="t m7fd x27 h35 y10ee ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">free from addition or subtraction. Though Jesus was no longer on earth, His </div><div class="t m7d7 x27 h35 y1d02 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">story leaped from continent to continent. The credibility of the good news rested, </div><div class="t m15f x27 h35 y13d9 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">not primarily in the strange message His followers proclaimed but in their own </div><div class="t m5f9 x27 h35 y1fb2 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">personal witness of what this message had done for them. A new life-style was </div><div class="t m58d x27 h35 y16e6 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">born. Love as never before imagined now motivated whole communities of </div><div class="t m196 x27 h35 y19ff ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">believers. The impact was unavoidable. It forced a response. As their Lord </div><div class="t m720 x27 h35 y1f21 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">predicted, the life of love became a rebuke and a judgment to those who were </div><div class="t m60a x11 h35 y219c ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">settled into their self-indulging, self-justifying ways. Alienation, ridicule, and </div><div class="t m8e x11 h35 y1d58 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">finally physical harm became the common lot of Christians. How could they </div><div class="t m5ed x11 h35 y13c5 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">survive such unfair treatment? Those who did had learned that their Lord was </div><div class="t mac1 x11 h35 y1bb4 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">close by, always providing the strength needed to bear any hardship. </div><div class="t m715 x14 h35 yc63 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">What we have just described is the life of faith doing what comes naturally </div><div class="t m877 x11 h35 y1c0f ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">for those who have learned the peace that comes from trusting and obeying their </div><div class="t m114 x11 h35 y1ee5 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Lord Jesus. Such living, dynamic faith has never been needed more than it is </div><div class="t m3bb x11 h35 y1fc7 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">today. The study of the letters to Timothy and Titus has never been more </div><div class="t m1a0 x11 h35 y1c7e ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">timely. We are living at a time when the work so nobly begun by Paul and his </div><div class="t m141 x11 h35 y1374 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">colleagues should be completed. The coming of their Lord to earth in great </div><div class="t m33d x11 h35 y1b1b ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">glory that they preached so convincingly is long overdue. The solution to the </div><div class="t m74f x11 h35 y1c99 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">urgent problems of an unfinished task and of a delayed advent may be seen in </div><div class="t ma38 x11 h35 y1a0a ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the passionate concern for authentic evangelism which permeates these three </div><div class="t m24e x11 h35 yf63 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">letters which will be the source of our study during this quarter. </div><div class="t m9db x14 h35 y1f2b ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Before beginning the verse-by-verse study of each book it would greatly </div><div class="t m48b x11 h35 y650 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">assist the student in understanding the book&apos;s message if he would read the </div><div class="t m417 x11 h35 y124f ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">whole book through once, or several times, at one sitting. </div><div class="t m1183 x11 h35 y2d61 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">1â€”A.Q. </div><div class="t m66b x5f h6 y2d61 ff2 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">3-75 </div></div><div class="pi" data-data='{"ctm":[1.000000,0.000000,0.000000,1.000000,0.000000,0.000000]}'></div></div>
