(Verse 13). </div><div class="t m1bb7 x4e h28 y2cc2 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Moses&apos; next excuse grew out of God&apos;s answer to his first. There still was </div><div class="t m777 x74 h28 y2cf9 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">some hesitation on his part to accept the divine call. </div><div class="t m56b x4e h22 y2bd6 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Why did Moses ask God&apos;s name?

Was he asking for information? </div><div class="t m692 x4e h28 y2907 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Moses knew God&apos;s name and who He was.

The servant&apos;s problem </div><div class="t m377 x74 h28 y6a1 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was not that he had seen too much. He had not seen enough. So Elisha </div><div class="t m14c1 x74 h28 y184d ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">prayed that the Lord would open the young man&apos;s eyes.
