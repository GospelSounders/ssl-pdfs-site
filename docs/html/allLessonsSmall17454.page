We saw the tremendous social, political, and religious impact that they are </div><div class="t m149c x92 h35 y44b ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">going to make on society as a whole as well as on the people of God. In fact, some of these </div><div class="t m19e1 x92 h35 yc44 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">climactic happenings are in process right now, and we are beginning to feel their effects. </div><div class="t m1521 x16 h35 ycc ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The lessons of last quarter emphasized the thought that the greatest crisis ever to confront </div><div class="t m8a4 x92 h35 y2026 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the church of God need not bring it desperation or confusion. </div><div class="t m19e7 x16 h35 y27f ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">On the contrary, God has made provision for every member of His family on earth to be </div><div class="t m2362 x15 h35 y1920 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">shielded by the power of heaven. They will be accompanied by Jesus, the angels, and the </div><div class="t m16a8 x92 h35 y4c ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Holy Spirit. They will march safely through deception, temptation, and persecution, reaching </div><div class="t m1629 x92 h35 y314 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">at last, by the grace of God, the final victory. </div><div class="t m2046 x16 h35 y9e1 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The rapid unfolding of events in the fields of science, politics, economics, morality, and </div><div class="t m1a12 x15 h35 y1f2 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">religion, portrayed daily by press, radio, and television, gives evidence that we are living in </div><div class="t m269 x15 h35 y51 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">earth&apos;s last hours. The sun of grace and mercy is about to set forever; the short night that </div><div class="t m601 x15 h35 y4ca ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">precedes the glorious morning will soon commence. </div><div class="t m518 x16 h35 y378 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">But along with the approaching end comes a responsibility to do the work of preaching </div><div class="t m1be3 x15 h35 y151 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the gospel to all the world. God will give to us an extraordinary measure of divine power to </div><div class="t m115b x15 h35 y29e ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">accomplish this task. This stimulates us to redouble our efforts, multiply our enthusiasm, </div><div class="t m162c x15 h35 y335 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and rededicate our talents, to the finishing of the work. </div><div class="t m2d74 x71 h35 ycc9 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">But what if the hour of the end catches us unready? What if the final hour of the world—or </div><div class="t m119e x15 h35 y8f7 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of our own lives—should overtake us as a thief in the night? What if we have not made the </div><div class="t m1144 x15 h35 y214 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">necessary spiritual preparation? Of what value, then, would be the knowledge of what will </div><div class="t m1488 x15 h35 y206b ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">happen? </div><div class="t m5df x71 h35 y28a ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">This is why, during this quarter, we plan to study about our personal preparation for the </div><div class="t m683 x15 h35 y104 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">final crisis. We need to make our readiness sure for this time of crisis. </div><div class="t m14ce x71 h35 ycbe ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">In these lessons we shall note the message to Laodicea. We shall analyze the counsel of </div><div class="t m1e16 x15 h35 y17e ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the True Witness. We consider the shaking of God&apos;s people. The revival and reformation </div><div class="t mdff x15 h35 y41c ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">through which God wants to take His church collectively—and every one of us </div><div class="t m680 x15 h35 y9ad ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">individually—shall be another important subject of our study, followed by the all-important </div><div class="t m80a x15 h35 y2c1 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">promise and entering into the experience of righteousness by faith. </div><div class="t m16e6 x71 h35 y43d ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Then we discuss the sealing, the baptism of the Holy Spirit, and the latter rain. We examine </div><div class="t m1c7b x15 h35 y5d7 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">their importance in finishing God&apos;s work. We study the conditions necessary to receive the </div><div class="t m1d93 x15 h35 y453 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">showers of the Holy Spirit, and the need for a consecrated witnessing activity. It is our hope </div><div class="t m636 x15 h35 y97 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that this will strengthen us spiritually, will make us alive, and will motivate us to spread the </div><div class="t mc6 x27 h35 y305 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">light of God in a fast and miraculous way. </div><div class="t m281 x71 h35 y21d ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Finally, we consider the specific ways of getting ready for the day of the Lord, giving </div><div class="t mb44 x15 h35 yeb ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">attention to the steps we must take in our own life to make our readiness sure. </div><div class="t md0a x71 h35 y184 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The Lord longs for us to overcome our I u kewarmness and indifference, and to seek higher </div><div class="t m35e x15 h35 y201 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">spiritual ground. He wants us to dedicate the necessary time to the study of His Word, and </div><div class="t m1a5b x27 h35 y713 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">also to devote time to secret prayer and to the examination of our spiritual needs. He desires </div><div class="t m201d x27 h35 y165 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that every one of us may understand practically and experientially what the righteousness of </div><div class="t m3142 x27 h35 y239 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Christ is. He wants us to claim the mighty work of His grace in conquering sin in our lives. He </div><div class="t m119e x27 h35 y1e4 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">would have us make a full surrender and a total commitment. He would have us overcome </div><div class="t m1d93 x27 h35 y42e ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">our defects of character and reflect in our lives, always more perfectly, the image of Christ. </div><div class="t m1a0d x71 h35 yc8 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">May these lessons help us to acquire this experience and to be fully prepared to meet our </div><div class="t m5cb x27 h35 yc73 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Lord in peace and joy. </div><div class="t m456 x1de h35 y448 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">7 </div></div><div class="pi" data-data='{"ctm":[1.000000,0.000000,0.000000,1.000000,0.000000,0.000000]}'></div></div>
