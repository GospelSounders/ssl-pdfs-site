Colossians, which was no doubt written about </div><div class="t mae4 x4a h2d y2e61 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the same time as Ephesians, lists eleven individuals, including Tychicus, </div><div class="t mcf6 x14 h2d y2ae3 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in its final chapter. In writing his concluding chapter to the Romans, Paul </div><div class="t m2ff x14 h2d y2ac6 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">mentions 35 personal names. These include some who were sending their </div><div class="t mb90 x14 h2d y2afd ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">greetings to the Romans. </div><div class="t m51f x64 h2d y2aba ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The lack of personal references in Ephesians could suggest that Paul </div><div class="t m477 x14 h2d y2b85 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">may have not known many of the Ephesian members by name at the time </div><div class="t m9b x14 h2d y239c ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">he wrote. However, this would be strange in view of the fact that he had </div><div class="t m87c x14 h2d y2301 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">labored nearly three years and three months in Ephesus. (See Acts 19:1, </div><div class="t m60f x14 h2d y20a4 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">8, 10.) A better explanation is that the letter was intended for the believ-</div><div class="t m15a x14 h2d y18d ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ers in the towns and villages surrounding Ephesus as well. If the letter </div><div class="t m546 x14 h2d y1287 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">were addressed to other believers besides those at Ephesus, then we </div><div class="t m6d7 x14 h2d yfb6 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">would not expect Paul to name persons in just the one church. Doing so </div><div class="t m107e x14 h2d y8ea ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">would cause the others to feel left out. Thus the opening words of Paul in </div><div class="t m33c x14 h2d y4fa ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">this epistle can be better understood to read: &quot;Paul, an apostle of Jesus </div><div class="t m34a x14 h2d ya41 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Christ by the will of God, to the saints which are in the Ephesian region.&quot; </div><div class="t m9d1 x14 h2d yb08 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The letter to the Colossians was written not only for the church at </div><div class="t m9b8 x14 h2d y857 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Colossae but also for the churches at nearby Laodicea and Hierapolis </div><div class="t m101 x5d h2d y4de ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">(Col. 4:13-16). In the same way, Ephesians could have been written for the </div><div class="t m3b0 x5d h2d y3cf ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">churches in the neighborhood of Ephesus. </div><div class="t m147a x14 h6c y662 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">III.
