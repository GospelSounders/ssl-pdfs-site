In departing, Christ could send the Spirit to bring </div><div class="t m1226 x26 h28 y2cdb ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Himself to be present everywhere. Cumbered with humanity, Christ no </div><div class="t mbc x26 h28 y2ba0 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">longer had omnipresence. This is why it was expedient that He depart. </div><div class="t m1add x26 h28 y299c ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Rather than be limited to one place at a time, through the Spirit He could be </div><div class="t maac x26 h28 y29bd ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">everywhere all the time. With this in mind, Jesus said, &quot;I will ask the Fa-</div><div class="t m173a x26 h28 y29fb ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ther, and He will give you another Counselor . . . the Spirit of truth. . . . I </div><div class="t m7d5 x26 h28 y2284 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">will not leave you as orphans; I will come to you&quot; (John 14:16-18, NIV). </div><div class="t ma2c x74 h22 y1035 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">What new names are given to the Holy Spirit in the New Testament? </div><div class="t m56a x26 h22 y1e56 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">John 14:16, 17. </div><div class="t m866 x74 h28 y1d90 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">In the New Testament age the Holy Spirit brings Christ to people in a way </div><div class="t m55d x26 h28 y12ee ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">not done before.

His life and death have made a decisive differ-</div><div class="t mec4 x26 h28 ybcd ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ence to us. What He has wrought out for us needs now to be applied within </div><div class="t m18fb x26 h28 y1512 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">us. The Spirit does not add to what Christ has done any more than a mailman </div><div class="t m3d9 x26 h28 y10c0 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">adds to the letter he delivers. There still is only one name &quot;given among </div><div class="t ma27 x26 h28 y1513 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">men whereby we must be saved,&quot; and that is Jesus (Acts 4:12).

The Spirit does not apply Christ&apos;s work to people on earth—He </div><div class="t ma28 x26 h28 y1514 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">brings Christ Himself to make the application. </div><div class="t m57b x74 h22 yf2d ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">What part does the Holy Spirit have in interceding for us before the </div><div class="t m807 x26 h22 y130f ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">throne of God? How does this indicate His love for us? Rom. 8:26, 27. </div><div class="t me31 x18 h22 y1311 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">IV.
