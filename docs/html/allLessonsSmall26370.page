H. Zachary </div><div class="t m463 x74 h22 y29a1 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Jason was nearing graduation from a university in Papua New </div><div class="t m11d x71 h22 y29ef ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Guinea. He was confident that he would find a good job. Then two </div><div class="t m1570 x71 h22 y2aa6 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">things happened that changed his life. </div><div class="t m19a9 x74 h22 y210b ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Jason attended some evangelistic meetings and became convinced </div><div class="t m14d9 x71 h22 y1d3b ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of God&apos;s claim upon his life. He surrendered his life to the Lord. </div><div class="t m64f x74 h22 y204d ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Following graduation Jason began searching for work. But with </div><div class="t m1135 x71 h22 y1411 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">only 30 percent of the population in Papua New Guinea employed, few </div><div class="t m14d9 x71 h22 yc76 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">employers were willing to honor his request for Sabbaths off. </div><div class="t m1a48 x61 h22 ya84 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Jason asked God what he should do, and God answered. Jason was </div><div class="t m14da x71 h22 y123f ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">convinced that God was calling him to share his faith among the </div><div class="t m1be3 x71 h22 y62e ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">islands that dot the southern coastline of Papua New Guinea, a chal-</div><div class="t m17a5 x71 h22 y1168 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">lenging and largely unentered area. Small villages dot tiny islands that </div><div class="t m5fa x71 h22 y10be ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">barely stand above the mud and water. The people suffer health </div><div class="t m2f85 x71 h22 y1de6 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">problems from their environment, and most cannot read or write. The </div><div class="t m2fe6 x71 h22 y14d5 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">majority have never heard the good news about Jesus. </div><div class="t m18b7 x61 h22 y13f4 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">With only his Bible and the clothes he wore, Jason journeyed to his </div><div class="t m2133 x26 h22 y1564 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">island mission field. In the first village he made the people an offer. &quot;If </div><div class="t m147b x26 h22 y11a7 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">you will provide me with food and shelter and transportation costs, I </div><div class="t m1941 x26 h22 y2097 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">will teach you how to read.&quot; The villagers agreed. </div><div class="t m9f4 x61 h22 y14ab ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Using his Bible as a reading textbook, Jason set up class. Villagers </div><div class="t m25b x26 h22 yc03 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">flocked to learn how to read. And as the light of literacy dawned on </div><div class="t m77c x26 h22 y12a2 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">them, the light of Bible truths dispelled their spiritual darkness. </div><div class="t m76f x61 h22 y143e ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Soon Jason began Bible studies, and a number of villagers made </div><div class="t m15be x26 h22 y1c30 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">decisions to follow Christ. When a small group of believers was firmly </div><div class="t mcf3 x26 h22 y15d1 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">established in this village, Jason moved on to the next island village, </div><div class="t m14ce x26 h22 y1f39 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">where he repeated his offer with equal success. </div><div class="t me56 x61 h22 y1c87 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">A mission worker learned of the work Jason was doing and asked </div><div class="t m868 x26 h22 y18e2 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">him, &quot;What supplies do you have for your work?&quot; </div><div class="t m1121 x64 h22 y11b0 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Jason answered, &quot;I have my Bible.&quot; </div><div class="t m15be x61 h22 y1109 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;What else?&quot; the man wanted to know. </div><div class="t m2d74 x61 h22 y74f ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;I have Jesus.&quot; </div><div class="t m20dc x64 h22 yde4 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The pastor emptied his case of all the books and gave them to Jason </div><div class="t m93a x26 h22 y1a02 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to enrich his teaching.
