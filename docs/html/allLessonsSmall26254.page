H. Zachary </div><div class="t m410 x5d h27 y2b75 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Tomaszyk Stanislaw is well known in his province of Poland. </div><div class="t m57e xe3 h27 y2b75 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0"> </div><div class="t m324 x17 h27 y2ae0 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">During his youth he had won many awards in the sport of weight </div><div class="t m167b x17 h27 y28f6 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">lifting. He was proud of his muscular physique; he enjoyed excel-</div><div class="t mebe x17 h27 y2428 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">lent health and looked forward to a good life. </div><div class="t ma30 x48 h27 y2318 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">But shortly after his fortieth birthday he began to experience </div><div class="t me70 x17 h27 y2099 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">considerable pain in his joints. Stiffness and weakness set in. Soon </div><div class="t me73 x17 h27 y6f9 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">this strong man had to use a wheelchair to get around. </div><div class="t m9ff x5d h27 y1251 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">One day while browsing in a book shop, he found a book on </div><div class="t m2f6 x17 h27 y762 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">health. As he leafed through it, he decided he must have this book. </div><div class="t m25 x17 h27 y7a5 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">He noticed that it was published by one of the sects in Poland that </div><div class="t md0d x17 h27 ya2a ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">his priest had warned parishioners about. But he bought it anyway. </div><div class="t m25d x48 h27 y50f ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">As he read the book, he found that the lifestyle suggestions </div><div class="t me53 x3e h27 yaa9 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">made sense to him. He adjusted his life in accordance with the </div><div class="t mce8 x3e h27 y20e4 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">book&apos;s suggestions. He gave up meat and began following the </div><div class="t m1b2 x17 h27 y567 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">eight principles for good health: good nutrition, exercise, use of </div><div class="t m5c3 x17 h27 yfba ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">water, sunshine, plenty of fresh air, temperance, adequate rest, </div><div class="t m3d8 x17 h27 y53f ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and trust in God. </div><div class="t m5b2 x48 h27 y71f ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Stanislaw noticed that the book often referred to the Bible. He </div><div class="t m7ef x3e h27 y2dd ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">purchased a Bible and began reading it. As he found new biblical </div><div class="t mb54 x3e h27 y8e ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">principals, he put them into practice in his life. He was amazed at </div><div class="t mb2 x3e h27 y903 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the difference it made. As he continued reading the Bible, he </div><div class="t m4c3 x3e h27 y798 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">realized that the Bible commands believers to keep Sabbath holy </div><div class="t md7 x3e h27 y13cf ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">rather than Sunday. He began keeping the Sabbath. </div><div class="t m1ec x48 h27 y894 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Stanislaw&apos;s wife did not share Stanislaw&apos;s new religious enthu-</div><div class="t m574 x3e h27 y4e8 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">siasm or the changes he was making in his life, and eventually she </div><div class="t m1289 x3e h27 yf70 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">left him. Undaunted, Stanislaw began searching for people who </div><div class="t m14a8 x3e h27 y8bf ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">followed the principles he had found in the health book. He searched </div><div class="t m7e3 x3e h27 y3db ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">for five years before he met an Adventist pastor who confirmed </div><div class="t m42d x3e h27 y9ae ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that Seventh-day Adventists teach and practice the biblical and </div><div class="t m4e x16 h27 y183 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">health principles he had found. Stanislaw is studying the Bible </div><div class="t mebe x3e h27 y897 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">with the pastor and looks forward to being baptized. </div><div class="t me0d x73 h27 y66d ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">In every community honest souls are searching for a better life </div><div class="t mbb x16 h27 y82b ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">by improving their health, reducing their stress levels, and finding </div><div class="t m71a x16 h27 y89a ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">answers to their spiritual questions.
