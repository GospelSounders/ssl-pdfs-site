Verses 5-7. </div><div class="t m252 x18 he ya4 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">NOTE.—&quot;The sheep that has strayed from the fold is the most helpless of </div><div class="t m34f x15 he y147 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">all creatures. It must be sought for by the shepherd, for it cannot find its </div><div class="t m7c1 x15 he y50c ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">way back.

The coin, </div><div class="t m51e x15 he y235 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">though lying among dust and rubbish, is a piece of silver still.
