But most people in Hong Kong do not have Christ. </div><div class="t m783 x5d h28 y22f9 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">With the majority of residents living in high-rise apartments, it </div><div class="t m1e1 x11 h28 y15b4 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">is difficult to make contact with them. Non-residents cannot enter </div><div class="t m1e9 x11 h28 y465 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">an apartment building without an invitation. So how do Christians </div><div class="t m222 x11 h28 y88d ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">reach others for Christ? That&apos;s the challenge. And with the im-</div><div class="t m590 x11 h28 y19ac ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">pending reversion of Hong Kong to China, it is a challenge that </div><div class="t m44b x11 h28 y1847 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">must be met soon. </div><div class="t m14c x5d h28 y17ee ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Recently a group of Adventists began a small-group program </div><div class="t m7d3 x11 h28 y15f3 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">called cell-group evangelism. Members began meeting in their </div><div class="t m434 x11 h28 ye09 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">apartments to study the Bible and to pray. They began inviting </div><div class="t m72a x17 h28 y1c29 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">friends, and the cell groups grew. When groups reached a given </div><div class="t m255 x11 h28 y176a ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">number of members, they divided and formed more groups. There </div><div class="t m308 x11 h28 y4c2 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">were women&apos;s groups, students&apos; groups, health groups, and others. </div><div class="t m22b x17 h28 y5f9 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Each group reached out to others, especially non-Christians, with </div><div class="t m877 x11 h28 yf2b ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">similar interests. Friendships formed, and trust grew. </div><div class="t m1d4 x5d h28 y637 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Then a series of evangelistic meetings was planned. Normally, </div><div class="t m6ec x17 h28 y1889 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">thousands of dollars of advertising would bring only a few non-</div><div class="t mac1 x17 h28 y12a ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Christians to such meetings. But this time the focus was on cell-</div><div class="t m56 x17 h28 y723 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">group members and contacts. Without a single pamphlet or tract, </div><div class="t mfc x17 h28 ye32 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">nearly 1,000 people attended each meeting, and more than 50 </div><div class="t md14 x17 h28 y1ff8 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">persons were baptized. </div><div class="t mbb2 x48 h28 y1e61 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">One new member is Christine, whose junior high school teacher </div><div class="t m28e x17 h28 y1f30 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">invited her to a cell-group meeting. This was her first contact with </div><div class="t m7b7 x17 h28 y408 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Christianity. She liked the spiritual emphasis, and eventually en-</div><div class="t m42f x17 h28 yd5f ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">rolled in Hong Kong Adventist College. Then came the evangelis-</div><div class="t m110b x17 h28 y109f ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tic meetings, where she gave her life to Christ. But she did not </div><div class="t m87f x3e h28 y145e ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">know how to have devotions or to find fellowship with other </div><div class="t m83e x3e h28 y6c1 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Christians. She was introduced to a student cell group, where she </div><div class="t mf8 x3e h28 y94f ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">learned how to study the Bible more deeply and share with others </div><div class="t m89 x3e h28 y323 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">her feelings about life and God. She found encouragement, sup-</div><div class="t m783 x3e h28 y47c ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">port, and training in the cell group. It wasn&apos;t long before Christine </div><div class="t m1315 x3e h28 y54d ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was baptized. </div><div class="t m904 x48 h28 y1e63 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Join with our members in Hong Kong as they pray for the </div><div class="t m6bf x3e h28 yba7 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">millions who do not know Christ.
