They </div><div class="t m635 x27 h35 y1c5 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">don&apos;t see Him, and they don&apos;t think they have personally heard from </div><div class="t mdcb x27 h35 y5af ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Him. The Adventist person&apos;s whole religious life stems from his </div><div class="t m451 x27 h35 y149 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">belief that, while God can&apos;t be seen, He is near and has been heard </div><div class="t mdff x27 h35 y3ea ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">from. He believes that since the Fall, God has communicated with </div><div class="t m222 x27 h35 y854 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">people through nature, prophets, and special providences. These </div><div class="t m160 x27 h35 yd3 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">avenues conveyed to people a knowledge of God, but always one </div><div class="t mef x27 h35 y2d8 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">step removed from actually seeing God. One could see His products </div><div class="t m214 x27 h35 y25f ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in nature, or His mighty acts in emergency situations, or hear His </div><div class="t m345 x27 h35 y622 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">words proclaimed by a prophet, or see symbols that represented </div><div class="t m810 x27 h35 y244 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">His acts of salvation for His earthly children. What more could man </div><div class="t m372 x27 h35 yb1 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">hope for? He could hope to see God Himself. Nature, tarnished by </div><div class="t m44f x27 h35 yae8 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sin, gave only a partial testimony about God; words, plagued by </div><div class="t m144 x27 h35 y494 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ambiguity, gave an equivocal testimony; and symbols, subject to </div><div class="t mca x27 h35 y3bc ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">misinterpretation and perversion of purpose soon lost their meaning. </div><div class="t m16a x4a h35 y585 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">But why is it important to hear from God? For the same reason </div><div class="t m268 x27 h35 y5d2 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that it is important to find directions for use enclosed with a product </div><div class="t mea6 x27 h35 y1efe ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">you purchase. </div><div class="t m1a7 x4a h35 y1bc ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The manufacturer of the product, especially if the product is </div><div class="t m73d x27 h35 y38b ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">complex, provides directions for use. These directions are necessary </div><div class="t m194b x27 h35 y5b7 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in order to prevent injury to the user or damage to the product </div><div class="t m70b x27 h35 y5e ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and to assure that the buyer has the right product to fit his need. </div><div class="t m211 x27 h35 y6e3 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">This world, its people, and other life forms are God&apos;s products. How </div><div class="t m7af x27 h35 y43c ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">shall people, at once products and users, know how to use what </div><div class="t m1a3 x27 h35 ye3 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">God has made, especially themselves—especially when someone </div><div class="t m9f5 x27 h35 ybf ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">else has distributed directions for use destructive to the user and </div><div class="t m614 x11 h35 y658 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">libelous to the Maker? So we need• to hear from the Maker. We </div><div class="t m5a1 x27 h35 y91d ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">need to know that He is to be trusted in the directions He gives. </div><div class="t me9 x14 h35 ye8 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Even more importantly we need to know the nature of His char-</div><div class="t m3dd x11 h35 y321 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">acter because the directions for human character grow out of the </div><div class="t m9f x11 h35 yba0 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">divine character; and as one by knowing God learns to trust God, </div><div class="t m3a1 x11 h35 y8a8 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">his confidence in Him prompts consent to God&apos;s character as the </div><div class="t m1b5 x11 h35 ycf8 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">base of his own life-style. So God Himself came to earth as Jesus </div><div class="t m6d4 x11 h35 y163 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of Nazareth in order that people could become acquainted with </div><div class="t m179 x11 h35 y221 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the unseen Father through the visible Jesus.
