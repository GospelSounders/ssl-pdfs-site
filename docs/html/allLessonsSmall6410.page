It was provided that they should eat of the </div><div class="t m19 x27 h4 y196d ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">food and drink of the wine that came from the king&apos;s table. In this the </div><div class="t ma5 x27 h4 y1ab0 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">king thought to give them an expression of his favor and of his solici-</div><div class="t m8d9 x27 h4 y18c1 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tude for their welfare.

Even a mere pretense of eating the food or drinking </div><div class="t m6e9 x27 h4 yb30 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the wine would be a denial of their faith. To do this would be to array </div><div class="t m20e x27 h4 y20b5 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">themselves with heathenism, and to dishonor the principles of the law </div><div class="t m94 x27 h4 y1e79 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of God.

But Daniel </div><div class="t m3c3 x27 h4 y214b ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">did not hesitate.
