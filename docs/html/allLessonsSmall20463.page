Whatever else may have been involved, the feelings </div><div class="t m5eb x28 he y2f1c ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">were so strong that the other presidents and some of the princes were seeking </div><div class="t m45f x28 he y2e91 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">some legitimate reason for destroying Daniel. </div><div class="t m1b4 x6f h1 y2b70 ff1 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">3. The Plot (Dan. 6:5-9). </div><div class="t meda x6f h1 y2b6c ff1 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">What area of Daniel&apos;s personal life did the presidents and princes choose </div><div class="t mab9 x36 h1 y287b ff1 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">as the area of attack and why? Verse 5. </div><div class="t mb06 x34 he y234f ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">In the matter of doing what he understood that God required of him Daniel </div><div class="t m373 x36 he y12c1 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was steadfast and firm. At the very beginning of the captivity he had purposed </div><div class="t m7f0 x36 he y35e ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">not to be defiled with the food that came from the king&apos;s table. He had pursued </div><div class="t m10fd x36 he y1ae1 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">his goal tactfully, but with determination. If he had been on the plain of Dura, he </div><div class="t m43b x36 he y2b0 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">would have taken the same stand as his three companions and refused to bow </div><div class="t mb1b x36 he y7a5 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">down to the golden image, even though the threatened result of disobedience </div><div class="t m83b x36 he y280 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was death. Daniel knew that God would not let anyone down who was deter-</div><div class="t m654 x36 he y5ce ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">mined to be faithful to Him. The prophet was not afraid to talk plainly to Nebu-</div><div class="t ma30 x29 he y10a5 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">chadnezzar about his need to be humble and give God the glory for everything </div><div class="t m373 x29 he y4c1 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that he possessed. He was not slow to rebuke Belshazzar before the assembled </div><div class="t mce3 x29 he y260 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">nobles, nor to speak plainly of impending personal disaster. The presidents and </div><div class="t m4cd x29 he y1072 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the princes knew that if they could bring in some regulation that affected the </div><div class="t m3f5 x29 he ydea ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">principles by which Daniel lived, they would be able to put him on the wrong </div><div class="t m112a x29 he yb2 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">side of the law—not the law of God, but the law of the king. </div><div class="t m1f6 x34 he y5ec ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The scheine proposed had to do with prayer or making petitions. For thirty </div><div class="t m5eb x36 he y612 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">days no one in the kingdom was to offer a prayer to or make a petition of any </div><div class="t m654 x36 he ycca ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">god.
