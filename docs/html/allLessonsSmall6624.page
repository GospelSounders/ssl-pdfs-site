To get the force of the illustration, we </div><div class="t m72d x0 h4 y1ccf ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">should understand shepherd life in the East. Note the following descrip-</div><div class="t m19a xb7 h4 y1db8 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tion of an Oriental scene: </div><div class="t ma x11 h4 y14f1 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;As we sat and looked, almost spellbound, the silent hillsides around </div><div class="t m9b8 xb7 h4 y1085 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">us were in a moment filled with life and sound. The shepherds led their </div><div class="t m20e xb7 h4 y1024 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">flocks forth from the gates of the city. They were in full view, and we </div><div class="t m85b xb7 h4 y1333 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">watched them and listened to them with no little interest. Thousands </div><div class="t m2da xb7 h4 y1484 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of sheep and goats were there, grouped in dense, confused masses. The </div><div class="t m7ca xb7 h4 y130c ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">shepherds stood together until all came out. Then they separated, each </div><div class="t m586 x0 h4 y10ca ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">shepherd taking a different path, and uttering, as he advanced, a shrill, </div><div class="t m9a8 xb7 h4 ye9d ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">peculiar call. The sheep heard them. At first the masses swayed and </div><div class="t m5fc xb7 h4 y1450 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">moved, as if shaken by some internal convulsion; then points struck out </div><div class="t m52a xb7 h4 y109a ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in the directions taken by the shepherds; these became longer and </div><div class="t m102 xb7 h4 y15c0 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">longer, until the confused masses were resolved into long, living streams, </div><div class="t m603 xb7 h4 y1cda ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">flowing after their leaders. Such a sight was not new to me, still it had </div><div class="t m5f3 xb7 h4 y10df ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">lost none of its interest.
