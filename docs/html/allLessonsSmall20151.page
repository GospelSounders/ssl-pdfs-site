First, the point </div><div class="t m437 x28 h2d y2b28 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">he makes in 1:5-14 is important for his exhortation at 2:1-4. Here he con-</div><div class="t m99 x28 h2d y29bd ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">trasts &apos;the message declared by angels&apos; (2:2) with the salvation &apos;declared </div><div class="t mb56 x28 h2d y29fb ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">at first by the Lord&apos; (2:3). The former refers to the giving of the law at </div><div class="t m9f1 x28 h2d y28d8 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Sinai, where as Galatians 3:19 puts it, angels acted as intermediaries (see </div><div class="t m203 x36 h2d y1e03 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">also Deuteronomy 33:2). The latter refers to the giving of the gospel, </div><div class="t m148 x36 h2d y1ea8 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">spoken by the Lord Himself. That is, the apostle is showing </div><div class="t mbe7 xe2 h4a y1ea7 ff6 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">how much </div><div class="t m6bf x36 h4a y1e56 ff6 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">greater </div><div class="t mdd5 xb8 h2d y1f48 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">is the privilege of Christians—and so, how much greater the peril </div><div class="t m555 x36 h2d ybfa ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of neglect. The argument is from the lesser to the greater. If the people </div><div class="t m451 x28 h2d yd1b ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">who disobeyed at the time of Moses received punishment, how shall we </div><div class="t m9f9 x36 h2d y15de ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">think to escape if we ignore salvation so great—as greater as is the Lord </div><div class="t m36d x36 h2d y12ee ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">than angels? </div><div class="t mbb7 x34 h2d y1240 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;This explanation, however, does not seem sufficient in itself.
