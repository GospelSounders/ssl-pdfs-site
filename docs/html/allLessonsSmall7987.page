Many who had temporarily resided in that city now </div><div class="t m3ce x17 he y6f7 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">returned to their distant homes. The means by which the enemies of Christ </div><div class="t m1ba x17 he y4a3 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sought to crush the gospel resulted in scattering it. &quot;The fugitives were </div><div class="t m7db x17 he y51e ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">like so many lamps lighted by the fire of the Holy Spirit, spreading every-</div><div class="t mb97 x17 he y4db ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">where the sacred flame by which they themselves had been illuminated.&quot; </div><div class="t m43c x38 h22 y155b ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Persecution Spreads the Gospel </div><div class="t m1048 x48 he y71b ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">1. </div><div class="t m79c x4e he ybec ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Who is especially mentioned as agreeing to the death of Stephen? </div><div class="t m59a x17 he y11ee ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Acts 8:1. </div><div class="t m1f3 x48 he y361 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">2. </div><div class="t mb97 x28 he y15a7 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">How did Saul manifest his zeal as a persecutor?
