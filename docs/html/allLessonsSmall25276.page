With Russia&apos;s </div><div class="t ma2d x16 h27 y2875 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">new free market, her future looked bright. But one day an army </div><div class="t m4f x16 h27 y292c ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">officer came looking for her son. He was absent from his military </div><div class="t m21d6 x71 h27 y2391 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">post without leave, an extremely serious accusation. Suddenly Serafima&apos;s </div><div class="t me2 x16 h27 y44b ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">world began to crumble. Jewish by birth and the product of the </div><div class="t m156b x71 h27 y1586 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">godless Communist system, Serafima was not even sure that there </div><div class="t m680 x71 h27 y5dd ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was a God. But she was desperate; she began to pray. </div><div class="t m867 x74 h27 y1ed ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">God heard her prayers, she is sure, for not long after she prayed, </div><div class="t m7f5 x71 h27 y170 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the government granted amnesty to soldiers who had left their posts. </div><div class="t m1a0d x71 h27 y99d ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Serafima&apos;s son could come home. Following this experience, Serafima </div><div class="t mae0 x71 h27 yab ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">believed that there was a God who cared for her and her son. But she </div><div class="t m1bcc x71 h27 y5d0 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">did not know Him, nor did she know how to find Him. </div><div class="t m1662 x74 h27 y1cc ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">One day her son hurried home and told her, &quot;Mother, you must </div><div class="t m76b x71 h27 y413 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">come to hear Mark Finley. He has really helped me to understand </div><div class="t m63b x71 h27 y1611 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">about God!&quot; Serafima went to Finley&apos;s meetings, and in time both </div><div class="t m1084 x71 h27 y177 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">she and her son were baptized. </div><div class="t mafc x74 h27 y125 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">On the first Friday after her baptism, she went to her boss to ask </div><div class="t mcfe x71 h27 yc46 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">for Sabbath off. Because of her strong record as a leader in sales, </div><div class="t m628 x71 h27 y2de ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">he granted her request. As winter approached, and the sun set </div><div class="t m162c x71 h27 y265 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">earlier, Serafima asked for Fridays off. &quot;I am sorry,&quot; her boss said. </div><div class="t ma0c x71 h27 y2bb ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Your God will have to take care of that.&quot; Serafima knew she </div><div class="t m6bc x71 h27 y9ab ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">would lose her job if she insisted on keeping the Sabbath. And jobs </div><div class="t m45e x71 h27 y17d ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">were precious.

Was this where </div><div class="t mcd8 x71 h27 y6f1 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">God was leading her? She was willing to try.
