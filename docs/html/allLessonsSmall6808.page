But the </div><div class="t m128 x3 h4 y1eac ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Pentateuch was the foundation upon which all later writers built. Each one </div><div class="t m759 xb9 h4 y1fad ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of the sixteen major and minor prophets, most of whom lived centuries before </div><div class="t m16a x3 h4 y7e8 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Josiah and Ezra, refer in some way to the books of the Pentateuch, some of </div><div class="t m4e xb9 h4 y1c45 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">them making a number of references, direct or implied, to the contents of these </div><div class="t md1b xb9 h4 y15bb ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">books. Isaiah is credited with making more than five hundred such references; </div><div class="t m32e x3 h4 y18bf ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Ezekiel and Jeremiah each with over three hundred. The historical books of </div><div class="t m9c3 x3 h4 y1a89 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Joshua, Judges, Ruth, and Samuel also show an intimate acquaintance with </div><div class="t m1a7 xb9 h4 y1c55 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the entire Pentateuch; while the Psalms have scores of direct quotations </div><div class="t m1584 x3 h4 y1d7a ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">from it, and a multitude of allusions and references to it. Israel&apos;s experience </div><div class="t m5a2 x3 h4 y1d10 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">as portrayed in Psalms 78, 105, 106, is a reiteration of the recital given in the </div><div class="t m2c6 x3 h4 y1e71 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Pentateuch. If these books were not written for hundreds of years after the </div><div class="t m7c4 x3 h4 y1a5b ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">time of David, who lived a thousand years before Christ, whence did David </div><div class="t ma34 x3 h4 y116f ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">get his knowledge? A concrete illustration of the fallacy, of the critic&apos;s view </div><div class="t mac4 x3 h4 y164c ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">may be pertinent in this connection. In 2 Kings 14:6 we are told that Amaziah </div><div class="t m422 x3 h4 y1b89 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">refrained from slaying the children of the murderers of his father because it </div><div class="t m2a6 x3 h4 y1174 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was &quot;written in the book of the law of Moses&quot; (Deut. 24:16) that the children </div><div class="t md1c x3 h4 y1e72 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">should not be put to death for the sins of their fathers. If Deuteronomy was </div><div class="t md4 x3 h4 y1f69 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">not written until the time of Josiah, who lived nearly two hundred years later, </div><div class="t m3c1 x3 h4 y194a ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">how could Amaziah be restrained by its mandate?
