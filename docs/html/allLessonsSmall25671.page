Often a common narrative or ordinary circumstance is </div><div class="t m4cd x73 h28 y293d ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">used to illustrate a truth. One of Jesus&apos; favorite teaching devices was </div><div class="t m5b9 x73 h28 y2b40 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the use of parables.

Matt. 13:44. </div><div class="t m775 x60 h28 y1414 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">This parable is based on a rather common occurrence in the Palestine </div><div class="t m9b9 x73 h28 y9b0 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of Christ&apos;s day. It was a time when bank vaults did not exist. Thefts, </div><div class="t m6e2 x73 h28 y1240 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">robberies, and invasions were frequent. Those who had valuables </div><div class="t m572 x73 h28 y62f ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">worth trying to preserve often followed the custom of burying them in </div><div class="t m1ef x48 h28 y18dc ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">their fields. If, however, the individual or individuals who knew where </div><div class="t m1062 x48 h28 y10c3 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the family treasure was hidden were slain or exiled, the place where the </div><div class="t mcdb x48 h28 y1e15 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">treasure had been concealed might be forgotten. </div><div class="t maf6 x60 h28 y10ce ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">In this parable a man was working his neighbor&apos;s field on shares. </div><div class="t m6eb x48 h28 y10d2 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">One day he was plowing the field when, suddenly, the plow struck </div><div class="t mb2d x48 h28 y1452 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">something metallic. He stopped the oxen and found a small treasure </div><div class="t m623 x48 h28 ydb3 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">chest. As he broke it open, he recognized that it contained a fortune far </div><div class="t m5b1 x48 h28 ybd3 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">exceeding anything he ever hoped to own. But according to the laws of </div><div class="t me55 x48 h28 y12fa ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that country, it wasn&apos;t his unless he owned the field. Covering it up, he </div><div class="t m26c x73 h28 y1d29 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ran over to the owner&apos;s house and urged him to sell the field. </div><div class="t m720 x4e h28 y1c67 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;I&apos;m sorry, friend.

Finally the owner, in order to </div><div class="t m305 x48 h28 y10f7 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">get rid of him, placed a ridiculously high price on the field. &quot;All right, I&apos;ll </div><div class="t mae8 x73 h28 yece ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">buy it!&quot; the discoverer of the treasure answered, rushing off to sell </div><div class="t mb42 x48 h28 yd40 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">everything he owned so he could complete the transaction. </div><div class="t m14db x60 h28 y1a2a ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Jesus did not tell the story to teach us how to take advantage of our </div><div class="t maf6 x73 h28 y145e ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">neighbors.
