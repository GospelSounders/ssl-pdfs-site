The more </div><div class="t m12c2 x3 he y18c0 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">fully we know Him as the Wonderful One that He is, the </div><div class="t m1ae x3 he y1bdd ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">more intelligent will be our faith in Him, and the more shall </div><div class="t m697 x3 he y1685 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">we prize that personal fellowship with Him which is the very </div><div class="t mf0 x3 he y1a8a ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">essence of Christian experience. </div><div class="t m9ce x16 he y1a8b ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">We venture to offer suggestions concerning the method to </div><div class="t m48e x3 he y116f ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">be followed in studying these lessons. First read the synopsis </div><div class="t m12ea x3 he yc1d ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of the lesson, looking up each Scripture reference and ob-</div><div class="t m9ba x3 he y1ff1 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">serving the particular thought in the text which is to be em-</div><div class="t m878 x3 he y1c8f ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">phasized. Go over the synopsis a second time, reciting from </div><div class="t m712 x3 he y19b4 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">memory as many of the texts as possible. Repeat this process </div><div class="t m660 x3 he y1af2 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">until the texts have been mastered. Then read the notes, </div><div class="t m22c x3 he y10da ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">connecting each one with the phase of the lesson which it is </div><div class="t m9d9 x3 he y20de ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">designed to develop further. Having thus&quot; obtained a general </div><div class="t ma88 x3 he y639 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">grasp of the lesson, ask each question, and try to answer it </div><div class="t m15c2 x3 he y13fa ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in the exact words of the text appended to it, without re-</div><div class="t m110c x3 he y1fb0 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ferring again to the synopsis. Look up the text in the Bible, </div><div class="t m84f x3 he y1c0c ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">if necessary, but do not turn to the synopsis unless you are </div><div class="t m7b2 x3 he y141e ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">unable to recall the special teaching for which the text is </div><div class="t mfab x3 he yb3e ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">used. In this way, there will be some real study of the Bible, </div><div class="t mdd2 x3 he y1d04 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and not merely a superficial dealing with the synopsis, which </div><div class="t m418 x3 he y12a6 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">is prepared simply as a guide to the thought of the Scriptures. </div><div class="t m588 x3 he y1700 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Do not be discouraged if the results are not fully satisfactory </div><div class="t ma89 xb9 he y1f27 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">at first. Earnest effort will be richly repaid. </div><div class="t m337 x16 he y1b8e ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Through experience alone can the truths of the Scripture </div><div class="t mdb2 x3 he y194c ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">be really known. Therefore every lesson should be appro-</div><div class="t m427 x3 he y1f03 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">priated as a part of the life. &quot;We have believed and know.&quot; </div><div class="t m89c x3 he y1b9e ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The Holy Spirit is the only efficient teacher of divine truth, </div><div class="t m2a1 x3 he yb49 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and His aid should be constantly sought. &quot;If any man will </div><div class="t m111a x3 he y1d23 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">do His will, he shall know of the doctrine.&quot; Walk in the </div><div class="t mf38 x3 he y1d5e ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">light, and the light will grow brighter. </div><div class="t m1489 x16 he y1e63 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">There were 3,670 Sabbath school members who studied </div><div class="t m2420 x3 he y17c1 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">their lesson every day last quarter.
