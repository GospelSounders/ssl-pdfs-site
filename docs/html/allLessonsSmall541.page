Let us briefly summarize Peter&apos;s dis-</div><div class="t m7e7 x5d h2d y687 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">course.

Next he referred to the facts of the ministry, death, </div><div class="t m68c x5d h2d yc26 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and resurrection of Jesus. Acts </div><div class="t m19ef x9a h28 y1a68 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">2: 22-24. </div><div class="t m6a x7 h2d y1a68 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">These he men-</div><div class="t m5e2 x5d h2d y1677 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tioned as well-known events. Then in verses 25-28 he </div><div class="t m2d1 x5d h2d y28c ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">quotes the words of David in Ps. 16:8-11. He shows </div><div class="t m77d x5d h2d y1784 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">(verse 29) that this would not apply to David, because he </div><div class="t m3d9 x5d h2d y1a69 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was dead, and his sepulcher was with them till that day. </div><div class="t maff x5d h2d ye7 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">There was no one to whom the words could apply except </div><div class="t md0c x5d h2d y181c ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to Jesus, who was raised from the grave before he saw </div><div class="t m364 x5d h2d y1a36 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">corruption. Therefore, Dav:d was speaking prophetically </div><div class="t me0 x5d h2d yc9f ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of the resurrection of Christ. Verses 30-32.

Verse 33. Still </div><div class="t mae7 x5d h2d y1a6b ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">further it is shown that Christ must be the one referred </div><div class="t m769 x48 h2d y13d ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to, because he had not ascended into the heavens, but in </div><div class="t m25c x48 h2d y309 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Ps. f to: f he had said, &quot;The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit </div><div class="t md31 x48 h2d y18f3 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">thou at my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy foot-</div><div class="t m458 x5d h2d y1946 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">stool.
