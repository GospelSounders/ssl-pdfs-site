Not only was the Passover commemorative </div><div class="t m116b x16 h2d y29f3 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">but it also was typical.

Notice that their preparation </div><div class="t m42e x16 h2d y1550 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">involved both spiritual and physical aspects. They were to prepare the Pass-</div><div class="t m362 x16 h2d y18d9 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">over lamb and apply the blood to their doorposts. This symbolized spiritual </div><div class="t m478 x16 h2d yca9 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">acceptance of God&apos;s salvation.

The revelation of the Lamb of God and His role in the plan of </div><div class="t m271 x16 h2d y152b ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">salvation was progressive.
