It embraced the </div><div class="t m695 xda h35 y23ae ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">period immediately preceding the captivity of Judah by Babylon as well as the </div><div class="t m74f xda h35 y17e8 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">first years of its exile by the Euphrates. Three times during Jeremiah&apos;s ministry </div><div class="t m74e xc4 h35 y1f66 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the Babylonians under King Nebuchadnezzar came from the north and subdued </div><div class="t m31c xda h35 y1823 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">his country; namely, in 605, 598, and 586 B.C., culminating in the utter destruction </div><div class="t m871 xda h35 y191d ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of Jerusalem. </div><div class="t m24e x15 h35 y1fab ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The kingdom of Israel no longer existed in Jeremiah&apos;s day. Israel had been </div><div class="t m9c0 xc4 h35 y1883 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">carried into Assyrian captivity in 722 B.C., or more than 100 years before the </div><div class="t mde3 xc4 h35 y1618 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">major portion of Jeremiah&apos;s prophetic ministry. At times. Jeremiah contrasts </div><div class="t m7fb xc4 h35 y16f5 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Judah with Israel. Sometimes he applies the term Israel to all the tribes. </div><div class="t ma81 x15 h35 y1ae5 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The messages and experiences recorded in the book of Jeremiah are not. </div><div class="t ma92 xc4 h35 y1722 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">arranged in the order in which they occurred. The lessons for this quarter are </div><div class="t m44 xc4 h35 y4fd ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">arranged by subjects and thus may bring together in any one lesson passages </div><div class="t ma1d xc4 h35 y16f9 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">from throughout Jeremiah&apos;s book. </div><div class="t m720 x27 h35 ye74 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The life of Jeremiah is intimately interwoven with the history of the kingdom </div><div class="t m426 xc4 h35 y1b51 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of Judah during its declining years. His book to a large extent recites the adver-</div><div class="t m1d0 x0 h35 y1d8e ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sities that befell his country and himself. He lived amid a people who did not </div><div class="t m21f x0 h35 y17b2 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">want to heed God&apos;s counsel and who perished in rebellion against His will, as </div><div class="t m857 xc4 h35 y193e ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">foretold to them by the prophet. </div><div class="t ma4a x27 h35 y16b3 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">We have more information about Jeremiah than about any other Hebrew </div><div class="t m7cd xc4 h35 y1970 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">prophet. A large portion of his book is autobiographical. From these passages </div><div class="t m9b9 x0 h35 y34c ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">we gain an insight into Jeremiah&apos;s inner life and catch glimpses of his very soul. </div><div class="t m377 xc4 h35 y12c ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">He is the most tenderhearted of all the prophets. His heart nearly breaks because </div><div class="t mb5b xc4 h35 y1758 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of the fate that befalls his people. He wishes that his eyes were a brook that </div><div class="t m367 x0 h35 y16fe ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">would never run dry. See Jer. 9:1, 2. Even after Judah and Jerusalem had reaped </div><div class="t m5ab x0 h35 yb42 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">their fateful doom, his sorrow did not abate. The book of Lamentations consti-</div><div class="t maaa x0 h35 yc99 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tutes Jeremiah&apos;s dirge over unrepentant and ruined Judah. </div><div class="t m7e1 x27 h35 y68c ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">To Judah its fall before Babylon was the day of the Lord, or the day of God&apos;s </div><div class="t m83e x0 h35 y10a ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">judgment upon them because of their infidelity to Him and their disastrous diver-</div><div class="t m99 x0 h35 y17a0 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">gence from His will. The steadfastness of Jeremiah amid the adversity and per-</div><div class="t mdfd x0 h35 y87d ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">secution prior to the fall of Judah before the Babylonians serves as a tacit </div><div class="t m61c x0 h35 yfa5 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">admonition to God&apos;s children on the verge of their final deliverance to remain </div><div class="t m4b7 xb7 h35 y1aa6 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">loyal and true to God. Jeremiah was labeled and treated as a traitor to his </div><div class="t me81 xb7 h35 y1702 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">country because of his loyalty to God. In the last conflict prior to the final deliver-</div><div class="t m894 xb7 h35 yb4d ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ance, God&apos;s people will also be treated as traitors to their respective nations </div><div class="t m298 xb7 h35 y18cf ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">because of their loyalty to the King of heaven. Through his living example the </div><div class="t m88b xb7 h35 yc64 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">prophet Jeremiah encourages you and me to retain our loyalty to God even </div><div class="t m5a7 xb7 h35 y1905 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">through persecution and threat of death under the trying and difficult circum-</div><div class="t m46c xb7 h35 y181e ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">stances ahead of us. </div><div class="t m70b x11 h35 y714 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The whole Bible is the Word of God to man. But it contains special books </div><div class="t m387 xb7 h35 yba7 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">replete with lessons for a specific time or period of earth&apos;s history. The writings </div><div class="t mcf9 xb7 h35 y23a ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of the prophet Jeremiah have special importance to us who are living at the end </div><div class="t m22b xb7 h35 y161f ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of time. </div><div class="t m19e x11 h35 y1830 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">In studying the book of Jeremiah this quarter may God grant that we may </div><div class="t mb8c xb9 h35 y167f ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">find guidance for personal living and decision making today.
