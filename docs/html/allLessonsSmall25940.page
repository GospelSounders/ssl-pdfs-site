But </div><div class="t ma24 x16 h27 y2a0f ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">many wondered if they would be faithful to the new Bible truths </div><div class="t mdb7 x16 h27 y2121 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">they had accepted. Recently I heard some of these pastors share </div><div class="t m4cb x16 h27 y1036 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">how God is working in their lives. Let me introduce a few of them. </div><div class="t m7e9 x73 h27 ydd7 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Pastor P. Ponda is a third-generation pastor. He was leading </div><div class="t m5d1 x16 h27 y13e1 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">30 independent congregations when he met some Adventist pas-</div><div class="t me46 x16 h27 ye77 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tors. As the pastors discussed Bible truths, Pastor Ponda began to </div><div class="t m31a x16 h27 y1398 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">understand the Bible basis for Adventist teachings. He requested </div><div class="t m2ff x16 h27 y1069 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">baptism. &quot;I want the Adventist Church to shepherd my nearly </div><div class="t m468 x16 h27 yf21 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">four thousand people,&quot; he said. To date, nearly half of his mem-</div><div class="t m45e x16 h27 ycff ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">bers have been baptized. </div><div class="t ma21 x73 h27 y1327 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">When Assish Missal completed his seminary training, he felt a </div><div class="t m115e x16 h27 y1025 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">burden to reach the tribal people living in the mountains near his </div><div class="t m766 x16 h27 yc54 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">home. Then he attended a revival meeting conducted by Adventist </div><div class="t m68e x16 h27 y1173 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">evangelist Bhasker Rao. As he understood and accepted the Bible </div><div class="t m575 x16 h27 yf29 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">basis for Adventist teachings, he requested rebaptism. When </div><div class="t m10fd x16 h27 y109b ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">word of his conversion reached his home town, he was expelled </div><div class="t mb3b x16 h27 y128d ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">from the village and church officials canceled plans for a village </div><div class="t m4ff x16 h27 yfd2 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">marriage for his sister. Undaunted, Missal has formed three </div><div class="t md00 x71 h27 ya91 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Adventist congregations in his community. </div><div class="t m42d x74 h27 yd09 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Absalom Maik was a priest before he accepted the Sabbath </div><div class="t m55b x71 h27 yd24 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">message and was baptized. He became a lay preacher. An angry </div><div class="t mf25 x71 h27 y121d ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">crowd surrounded his family&apos;s house and threatened to take his </div><div class="t m325 x71 h27 ycad ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">life, but Maik&apos;s brother persuaded the mob to leave. However, </div><div class="t m165e x71 h27 y12b4 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Maik was excommunicated from the village and is not permitted </div><div class="t m667 x71 h27 ya4d ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">even to draw water from the village well. His converts have lost </div><div class="t m131c x71 h27 y475 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the privilege of being buried in the village graveyard. But Maik </div><div class="t m267 x71 h27 y79b ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">continues to witness.
