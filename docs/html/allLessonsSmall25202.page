A large tropical </div><div class="t me5e x16 h28 y2a6d ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ulcer on his leg caused him obvious pain. It was our first Sabbath </div><div class="t md14 x16 h28 y23f7 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">among the Iwam people on the May River in Papua New Guinea. </div><div class="t maaa x73 h28 y2347 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">After Sabbath, my husband, John, invited Sabien to the clinic, </div><div class="t me3b x16 h28 y1490 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">where he treated his wound. Gradually his sore healed, and Sabien&apos;s </div><div class="t m86f x16 h28 y535 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">gratitude overflowed. </div><div class="t m7a0 x73 h28 y808 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Sabien came faithfully to church, and eventually joined the </div><div class="t ma30 x16 h28 y2084 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">baptismal class. He was making wonderful progress. Then one day </div><div class="t me94 x16 h28 y373 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">a few weeks before the baptism, Sabien told John that he felt he </div><div class="t m218 x16 h28 y313 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">should not be baptized just yet. Surprised, John asked him why. </div><div class="t m289 x16 h28 y1f0 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Then Sabien explained that his father was building a house, and </div><div class="t me53 x16 h28 y1097 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">when it was finished his father would give it to him. According to </div><div class="t m1068 x16 h28 y97a ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">local custom, when a house is completed, the entire village comes </div><div class="t m264 x16 h28 y858 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to a feast given by the homeowner. Sabien&apos;s father expected him to </div><div class="t m20d x16 h28 y13b7 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">attend the ceremony. But beer and betel nut would be served, and </div><div class="t mdd0 x71 h28 y4e0 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Sabien did not feel right joining the feast after being baptized. </div><div class="t m5c5 x74 h28 y13ce ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">John and Sabien prayed about the situation, then John explained </div><div class="t m5c5 x71 h28 y8b3 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that the devil was using this ceremony to keep Sabien from follow-</div><div class="t m8a6 x71 h28 y8b7 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ing Jesus in baptism. Sabien decided he wanted to follow Jesus </div><div class="t m3a7 x71 h28 y9a3 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">now, and not wait until after the feast. We prayed earnestly that </div><div class="t m41b x71 h28 ydd ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">God would be with Sabien as he told his father of his decision. </div><div class="t m31b x74 h28 yb9 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Later Sabien returned to our home. He told us that his father had </div><div class="t m2d8 x71 h28 y267 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">become angry when he learned that Sabien would not drink the </div><div class="t m73f x71 h28 ya49 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">beer and chew betel nut at his father&apos;s feast. He told Sabien not to </div><div class="t m7b3 x71 h28 y120d ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">come to the feast, that he would not give Sabien the house as he </div><div class="t m351 x71 h28 y727 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">had planned. So Sabien, who had looked forward to living in the </div><div class="t m235 x71 h28 yaba ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">new house, was forced to move his family into a tiny, one-room </div><div class="t m115f x71 h28 ye89 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">house. But Sabien was not discouraged. He had decided that it was </div><div class="t m1308 x71 h28 yc3f ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">better to follow Jesus than to have a nice house. </div><div class="t m6b2 x77 h28 y200c ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Sabien was baptized. But that was not </div><div class="t m437 x32 h28 y6d5 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the end of his tests of faith. </div><div class="t mf1 xb3 h28 y4ee ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">(continued next week) </div><div class="t m2b x68 h22 y307 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Belinda Kent, her husband, John, and their </div><div class="t md33 x9c h22 y460 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">four children serve as missionaries in Papua </div><div class="t m164e x9c h22 yd2a ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">New Guinea under the auspices of Adventist </div><div class="t m7d2 x9c h22 y51b ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Frontier Missions. </div><div class="t m413 x5d h28 y150f ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Produced by the General Conference Office of N I i on . </div><div class="t mb1b xeb h28 y2105 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">87 </div></div><div class="pi" data-data='{"ctm":[1.000000,0.000000,0.000000,1.000000,0.000000,0.000000]}'></div></div>
