(In the years before the birth of </div><div class="t m113b x48 h2d y74c ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Christ, it was also called Mordecai Day.) As was done in the time of Esther, </div><div class="t m107d x48 h2d y11e3 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">gifts are given, and there is great rejoicing. </div><div class="t m404 x28 h2d y1cd3 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Purim has many characteristics in common with the Christian celebration </div><div class="t m83b x48 h2d y1cd4 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of Christmas. Besides gifts for the children, housewives send friends and </div><div class="t m5fa x48 h2d y1b90 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">relatives platters of food. The people hold special parties and costume balls. </div><div class="t m9b4 x28 h2d y1cd5 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The Jewish people gather in the synagogues, where parts or all of the </div><div class="t m7ef x48 h2d y105c ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">account of Esther is read. Because the name Haman is anathema to the Jews, </div><div class="t m57c x48 h2d y1239 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">a little game is played whereby the reader of the story lets his listeners know </div><div class="t m4cd x48 h2d y1363 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">when they are approaching his name. The congregation begins to stamp, </div><div class="t m8b0 x48 h2d y1466 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">clap, hiss, boo, and in general make noise because they must not hear the </div><div class="t m456 x48 h2d y15c5 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">name when it is read. Normally, traditional Judaism excuses women from </div><div class="t m1adc x48 h2d y114f ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">attending the synagogues because it believes that it is even more important </div><div class="t m5aa x48 h2d y1509 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">for the woman to remain at home to take care of small children. But at </div><div class="t m386 x48 h2d y1064 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Purim, women are obligated to attend because it was through a woman that </div><div class="t md2a x48 h2d y142e ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">deliverance was accomplished for the Jews in Persia. </div><div class="t m582 x28 h2d y146b ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The festival of Purim has helped the Jews to endure much persecution.
