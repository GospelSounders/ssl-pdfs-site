Their greed extended only to seizing the crop </div><div class="t mae1 xe h4 y10a5 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of the season. This greed indulged, the way soon opened for greater </div><div class="t m6a9 xe h4 yaa3 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">evil—they would seize upon the vineyard itself and make it their own </div><div class="t m570 xe h4 y580 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">possession.
