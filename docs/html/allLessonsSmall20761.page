Ruth 4:15. </div><div class="t m8d x5f h2d y2b31 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Notice the praise given Ruth.

In Gentile cultures, girl </div><div class="t ma71 x61 h2d y29cb ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">babies many times were cast aside to die. Even Jewish parents might be </div><div class="t m7f2 x74 h2d y2a50 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">disappointed at the birth of a female infant. One ancient Jewish writer men-</div><div class="t ma3b x61 h2d y2109 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tioned the sorrow some felt at the arrival of a girl child.

But, unlike the book of Job, the book of Ruth does </div><div class="t m8d x74 h2d y135c ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">not reveal insights into why God allowed tragedy to come to Naomi. Both </div><div class="t m1f8 x74 h2d y1c7b ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Job and Naomi had to learn to live without knowing why such tragic events </div><div class="t m45f x74 h2d y641 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">had been allowed to enter their God-fearing lives. </div><div class="t m5fa x74 h6c y1862 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ILLUMINATION: </div><div class="t m7e3 x82 h2d y1a97 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Naomi, like Job . . . is rendered bereft of those things </div><div class="t m5b1 x74 h2d y2156 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">which provide her security and she cannot comprehend why. . . . These two </div><div class="t m1da x74 h2d y18ce ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">characters in Old Testament stories are parallel, and the audience is meant to </div><div class="t m2a4 x74 h2d yc63 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ask the question &apos;Why?&apos; with them.
