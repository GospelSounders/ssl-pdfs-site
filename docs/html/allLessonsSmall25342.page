H. Zachary </div><div class="t m1d05 x48 h27 y2c2c ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">For years Leonid Kozlov lived a double life. A skilled pop music </div><div class="t m3ce x17 h27 y2c44 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">singer and guitarist, he enjoyed a wide following when he per-</div><div class="t m2bd x17 h27 y28e7 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">formed. But Leonid had a dark side. He had created a twisted </div><div class="t mc91 x17 h27 y21bd ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">theology that convinced him that God was helping him to steal from </div><div class="t me49 x17 h27 y2354 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">others, including his friends, and not get caught. Leonid was a thief. </div><div class="t m5c5 x48 h27 y2f8 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">He wore a good luck charm, a crucifix, around his neck on a </div><div class="t m356 x3e h27 y5f5 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">golden chain. He believed this crucifix would protect him. One </div><div class="t m469 x3e h27 y1877 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">night while walking alone, Leonid was attacked by a stranger. In </div><div class="t m568 x3e h27 y171f ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the moonlight he saw the man&apos;s knife being raised above his head. </div><div class="t m53c x3e h27 y1f0f ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Instinctively, Leonid raised his hands to deflect the blow. He felt </div><div class="t m60c x3e h27 y1878 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the sting of the knife on his hand, then on his chest. In a split </div><div class="t m1c7d x3e h27 y11e ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">second Leonid&apos;s life and his sins flashed before him. He fell to the </div><div class="t m133e x3e h27 y1885 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ground, and the attacker fled. He lay there several seconds, think-</div><div class="t m1be8 x3e h27 y16ac ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ing that his end had come. Then he managed to get up and struggle </div><div class="t m1be8 x3e h27 y1d96 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">home. His mother washed the blood away while they waited for an </div><div class="t m1319 x3e h27 y18b5 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ambulance. In the hospital the doctor cared for his wounds. </div><div class="t mcff x73 h27 y245 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The next day Leonid noticed that his crucifix was badly dam-</div><div class="t m1d79 x3e h27 y1f6 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">aged. The blade of the knife must have hit it. As Leonid examined </div><div class="t m10fe x3e h27 y153 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">his lucky charm, he thought, </div><div class="t m536 x1b h16 y186c ff6 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">There is a lesson here for me. This </div><div class="t m5c9 x3e h16 y20c6 ff6 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">crucifix saved me yesterday.

I must obey Him.&quot; </div><div class="t m505 x31 h27 y17d1 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Leonid burst into tears as he considered his </div><div class="t m1362 x3e h27 yb37 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">wicked life in the light of God&apos;s mercy. Leonid began to search for </div><div class="t maff x16 h27 yb3b ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">answers to his spiritual questions. </div><div class="t ma6a x73 h27 yc98 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Several weeks later Leonid learned about a series of Bible </div><div class="t m8d x16 h27 yb9e ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">lectures being held in the city. He attended faithfully. Night by </div><div class="t m354 x16 h27 y1900 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">night he thrilled to the new truths he was learning from the Bible. </div><div class="t m134d x16 h27 y6ac ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">In Jesus he found new hope and a new purpose in life. The Holy </div><div class="t m8a4 x16 h27 y1a35 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Spirit brought conviction to his heart. He gave his life to Christ. </div><div class="t m1311 x73 h27 y1690 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Leonid began sharing his new life in Jesus with others. Instead of </div><div class="t m1857 x31 h27 y134e ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">singing pop music, he began singing songs </div><div class="t mcc6 x6a h27 y1c44 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to God&apos;s glory in churches and evangelistic </div><div class="t m1c9a x6a h27 y691 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">meetings.
