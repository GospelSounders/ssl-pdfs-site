But Jesus chose </div><div class="t m1627 x92 h27 y1f50 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to challenge their approach to Sabbath keeping through healing miracles. </div><div class="t m57a x18 h87 y1a5a ff1 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Before one Sabbath miracle, Jesus gave the reasons for His </div><div class="t mbb5 x15 h87 y39c ff1 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">reformation of Sabbath keeping as practiced by the Pharisees. </div><div class="t m25 x15 h87 ya43 ff1 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Identify His two reasons.
