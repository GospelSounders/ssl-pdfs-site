But an eight- month drought had left the nearby river </div><div class="t m251 x71 h22 ye76 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">dry. Some skeptical villagers jeered at the Adventists, who insisted on </div><div class="t mf2f x71 h22 yf1c ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">baptizing by immersion, even when there was no water. The only </div><div class="t ma19 x26 h22 yec0 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">alternative was to baptize the new believers in an oil drum.

That </div><div class="t m162f x26 h22 y6cb ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">evening they gathered for vespers and once more asked God for rain, </div><div class="t m1e1a x26 h22 ya0e ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">though the skies were clear. </div><div class="t mb03 x61 h22 y128b ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The next morning Joe saw puddles of water outside his door.
