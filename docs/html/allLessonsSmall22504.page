Micah 6:16 (compare 1 Kings 16:25, 30). </div><div class="t m60c x11 h87 y23e9 ff1 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">God&apos;s threats of judgment to come are not made in anger. He </div><div class="t me4a xb7 h87 y6bf ff1 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">loves and cares for His people. He longs for them to recognize that </div><div class="t mb66 xb9 h87 ye19 ff1 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">what they have been doing is wrong and disappointing to Him. </div><div class="t m691 xb9 h87 ycfc ff1 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">He pleads with them to turn from evil. </div><div class="t m4d2 x17 h87 y1a64 ff1 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">He cares. A young singer bore a cross that seemed so heavy she </div><div class="t m44e xb9 h87 y13ad ff1 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was tempted to give up everything. But she had faith. And she </div><div class="t m580 xb9 h87 y2137 ff1 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">knew that God had the power to do all things.

Almost before her friend </div><div class="t m857 xb9 h87 y1419 ff1 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">could answer, she blurted out, &quot;Something terrible has happened. </div><div class="t m454 xb9 h87 y1dc9 ff1 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I&apos;m not a Christian anymore.
