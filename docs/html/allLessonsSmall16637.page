Watchman, what of the night?&quot; (Isa. 21:11). This </div><div class="t m1499 x92 h35 y17d3 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ancient cry from Edom echoes down the corridors of the centuries. The times were </div><div class="t mea6 x92 h35 y1837 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">perplexing, and the Edomites desired to know when the morning would come. They </div><div class="t m91b x15 h35 y1baa ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">longed for the dawn to roll away the mists of their dread and despair. </div><div class="t m645 x16 h35 y1990 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Ed om&apos;s fearful inquiry is breathed again by many thoughtful persons today. Jour-</div><div class="t m6ac x15 h35 y177c ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">nalists speak of our world community as being in &quot;a state of perpetual crisis.&quot; </div><div class="t mb49 x15 h35 y14d ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Modern communications and modes of travel have shrunk our world. Distant, un-</div><div class="t m400 x15 h35 y1686 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">known nations have become neighbors. What affects one part of the city affects the </div><div class="t m325 x15 h35 y121 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">other parts. And in this generation it seems as though the world city staggers from </div><div class="t m88a x15 h35 y18a4 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">one crisis to another. Men&apos;s hearts are fearful as they consider what disasters may be </div><div class="t m368 x15 h35 y186a ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">coming in the future. </div><div class="t m398 x71 h35 yac4 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">But God has not left His people in doubt as to the meaning &apos;of our times. The </div><div class="t m9b x15 h35 yb2e ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">prophecies of the Bible foretold the conditions which would develop in our world </div><div class="t m6c x15 h35 y1f2f ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">society just before Jesus&apos; return. The troubles of an aging creation are described as </div><div class="t m4d5 x15 h35 yc21 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the sharp pains and anguish of birth which in turn will issue forth the coming of </div><div class="t me29 x15 h35 y70f ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Christ, the cessation of sin, and the establishment of God&apos;s eternal kingdom. </div><div class="t m27c x71 h35 y21d3 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">In the Bible the period preceding the advent is called &quot;the time of the end.&quot; As we </div><div class="t m7f0 x27 h35 y1741 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">shall see, &quot;the time of the end&quot; is a specific period of time beginning at the close of </div><div class="t m2eb x15 h35 yf9f ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the papal period in 1798 and extending to the return of Christ. During this period </div><div class="t m426 x27 h35 y1e1c ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">would occur the signs foretold in Scripture. </div><div class="t m5e3 x71 h35 y1941 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Jesus announced that celestial signs would signal His coming. Gabriel told the </div><div class="t me5e x27 h35 y182c ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">prophet Daniel that his book would be opened and understood in &quot;the time of the </div><div class="t m610 x27 h35 y26a ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">end.&quot; And when the seal broke, earnest Bible students discovered that a great </div><div class="t m7eb x27 h35 y1c43 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">investigative, pre-advent judgment had begun in heaven and would continue during </div><div class="t m91b x27 h35 y41f ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the time of the end, vindicating God and the subjects of His kingdom. </div><div class="t m410 x71 h35 y6ad ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Prophecy also disclosed the rise of a vigorous religious movement that would give </div><div class="t m4cf x27 h35 ye7 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">God&apos;s last invitation of mercy with a special &quot;time of the end&quot; emphasis. </div><div class="t m64b x71 h35 y1925 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">But God&apos;s actions in heaven and through His last-day people would meet with many </div><div class="t m111e x27 h35 y1963 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">challenges on earth. Political, moral, social, and religious developments on earth </div><div class="t m85e x27 h35 yac8 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">would constitute not only signs of the nearing day of Christ, but would also pose </div><div class="t m711 x27 h35 y16d6 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">problems to the advancement of God&apos;s work. </div><div class="t m136a x26 h35 y28 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">As we study the many signs of distress and declension, we cannot but realize that </div><div class="t maf2 x27 h35 y1e42 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">humanity is nearly bankrupt. Insurmountable problems seem poised to crush out </div><div class="t m1315 x27 h35 y1717 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">human existence as we know it. Yet, while many despair, this can be the church&apos;s </div><div class="t m865 x27 h35 y169f ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">finest hour. Men at their wits end may now give pause to listen to what God&apos;s people </div><div class="t mea5 x27 h35 y13d ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">have to say. By word and by life-style the church may lift up Jesus Christ, the only </div><div class="t m1d7 x27 h35 y851 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">answer and hope of mankind. Daily the second advent becomes more relevant as the </div><div class="t me5e x27 h35 y1a56 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">only remedy for earth&apos;s ills. </div><div class="t m383 x26 h35 y1b3c ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Like the ancient prophet, the church may answer the despairing cry of modern man </div><div class="t m367 x11 h35 y1950 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">with the hopeful, yet truthful words: &quot;The morning cometh, and also the night.&quot; The </div><div class="t mad1 x11 h35 y1831 ff2 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">eternal day of Christ&apos;s kingdom is about to dawn, and sin&apos;s day will be forever ended. </div></div><div class="pi" data-data='{"ctm":[1.000000,0.000000,0.000000,1.000000,0.000000,0.000000]}'></div></div>
