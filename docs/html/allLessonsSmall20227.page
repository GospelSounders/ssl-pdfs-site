To believe something, it is maintained, is </div><div class="t m43a x74 h2d y2ef4 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to accept it as true and factual. To believe someone is to accept what that </div><div class="t m34b x61 h2d y2d79 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">person says as correct. </div><div class="t m83e x60 h2d y2c0c ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Even the devils are not atheists. &quot;Thou believest that there is one God; </div><div class="t m1fe x61 h2d y2a7e ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">thou doest well: the devils also believe, and tremble&quot; (James 2:19). The </div><div class="t mc6b x61 h2d y29d3 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">devils believe in God&apos;s existence and in His power. They even believe in </div><div class="t md13 x61 h2d y2a6a ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">His Word more readily than many Christians do—yet they tremble. </div><div class="t m698 x60 h2d y2182 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">This belief brings them no peace. Instead it leaves them trembling in </div><div class="t m1717 x61 h2d y243c ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">fear. Why do the devils tremble? This week we will discover that the dev-</div><div class="t mb4b x61 h2d y2318 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ils tremble because their belief is not the true belief that John describes in </div><div class="t m55c x61 h2d y20f2 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">his Gospel. </div><div class="t mec7 x74 h6c y1278 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I. BELIEVING IS TRUSTING (John 14:1). </div><div class="t m10b x60 h2d y15af ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">A toddler was placed on a high ledge by her father. He assured her that </div><div class="t m2c0 x64 h2d y139d ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">he would catch her, then told her to jump. Without hesitating, she pushed </div><div class="t m9d4 x61 h2d yc77 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">off from the ledge and plummeted into his arms. Far from being afraid, </div><div class="t me1a x61 h2d y837 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">she insisted that they do it again, and again, and again. </div><div class="t m21d x5f h2d yacf ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The father was amazed and more than a little gratified by her total con-</div><div class="t m87a x64 h2d y9b2 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">fidence that he would catch her. Had he stepped aside as she leaped from </div><div class="t m387 x61 h2d y81f ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the ledge, she surely would have been injured—perhaps seriously. But </div><div class="t m10f x64 h2d y957 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">she seemed not even to have considered that possibility. She trusted her </div><div class="t m40b x61 h2d y14b7 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">father implicitly. </div><div class="t mb1e x60 h2d ydf7 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">As we reflect on the basis for such trust, we must conclude that it prob-</div><div class="t m2eb x61 h2d ybb3 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ably was founded on two things. First, the daughter knew that her father </div><div class="t m781 x61 h2d yd96 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was </div><div class="t m456 x63 h4a yd96 ff6 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">able </div><div class="t m635 xa h2d yd06 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to catch her. He was strong enough to intercept her small body </div><div class="t m9c6 x61 h2d y903 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">easily as it hurtled toward the floor. Had she not, after all, seen him lift </div><div class="t m3e0 x61 h2d y6d1 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">heavy items of furniture? Had he not lifted her over his head so that she </div><div class="t m580 x61 h2d y7d6 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">could touch the ceiling? Was it not true that her daddy could do just about </div><div class="t m97 x61 h2d yd24 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">anything? </div><div class="t mb1e x60 h2d yb7d ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Second, she knew that her father loved her. She knew him well enough </div><div class="t md1b x61 h2d ybb8 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to know that he would not fail her. She knew that he cared about her too </div><div class="t m16f x61 h2d y1236 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">much to permit her to be harmed if he could prevent it. She </div><div class="t m616 xcc h4a y1236 ff6 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">believed </div><div class="t m644 x15e h2d yf3c ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in </div><div class="t m1308 x61 h2d y90a ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">him. Her belief extended far beyond a simple conviction that he basically </div><div class="t m308 x61 h2d yd40 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was truthful and benevolent; her trust was so thoroughly without reserva-</div><div class="t m77e x61 h2d yd7c ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tion that she could leap from a high place with no fear whatever. </div><div class="t m136a x74 h6c y1078 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">THINK IT THROUGH: What does John help us understand about the </div><div class="t m768 x74 h6c yd7f ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">deeper meaning of </div><div class="t m168b xa4 h4a yd12 ff6 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">believe? </div><div class="t ma34 x60 h2d ye53 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">It means far more than just accepting the facts about Jesus. It means </div><div class="t ma3e x61 h2d y10a2 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">more than agreeing that He is altogether powerful and full of love. To </div><div class="t m669 x61 h2d y82d ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">believe in Jesus Christ is to trust His power and love so completely that </div><div class="t m87a x61 h2d yfd6 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">we are willing to let go of every other possible support and cast ourselves </div><div class="t m1182 x61 h2d yb8b ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">totally upon Him. It is to abandon ourselves utterly to His goodness. It is </div><div class="t md0e x61 h2d ydd0 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to depend on Him absolutely and rely on Him perfectly. </div><div class="t mce2 x60 h2d ye3c ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Belief does include acceptance of certain facts; but </div><div class="t me7 x67 h4a y9c8 ff6 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">saving </div><div class="t m5eb xcb h2d ye3b ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">faith or be-</div><div class="t m172 x74 h2d yd84 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">lief must go beyond intellectual assent and include an active, dependent </div><div class="t m320 x74 h2d y9ca ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">trust in a person.
