Each time I prayed, my companions mocked me. The road </div><div class="t m663 x71 h27 y1046 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">became quite rugged. Suddenly we heard a bang, and the car jerked </div><div class="t m29a x71 h27 yca9 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">off the road and into the bush. As I struggled to control the car, it </div><div class="t m17f1 x71 h27 y1562 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">veered back onto the road. We stopped and jumped out to inspect the </div><div class="t m36f x71 h27 y116b ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">damage. The right front wheel had come off! The men who had been </div><div class="t m99a x71 h27 y2011 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">laughing minutes before now asked how I had steered the car without </div><div class="t m1678 x71 h27 y129d ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the wheel. I told them that God had protected us. </div><div class="t m804 x74 h27 y1485 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I left the others with the car and walked to the nearest town to find </div><div class="t m76f x71 h27 y1d7c ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">a mechanic. Two different mechanics looked at the car and said that </div><div class="t m639 x71 h27 y1c9d ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">without spare parts they could not repair it. And the parts were not </div><div class="t mebf x71 h27 y1d72 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">available in that town. </div><div class="t m46 x74 h27 yf2e ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I remembered that I had some nylon rope in the trunk.
