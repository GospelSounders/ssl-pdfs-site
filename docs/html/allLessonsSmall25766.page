For years she </div><div class="t m133d x71 h27 y2a47 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">cared for foster children. Most of the children came to her when they </div><div class="t m1ef x71 h27 y2a80 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">were quite young, but one day a social worker told Ruth about a </div><div class="t m1d77 x71 h27 y2aad ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">teenage boy named Heinz who needed a home. He was having difficul-</div><div class="t m269 x71 h27 y237c ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ties in school and in the foster home where he had been staying. The </div><div class="t m1be4 x71 h27 y231c ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">social worker asked Ruth to take him. </div><div class="t mf59 x74 h27 ya83 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Ruth was not sure. A teenager could be difficult to work with, and </div><div class="t m1f99 x71 h27 y1c10 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">she had other children in her home. Ruth told the social worker that she </div><div class="t m1cf6 x71 h27 yed9 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was an Adventist, and was away at church each Saturday from 8:00 to </div><div class="t mc91 x71 h27 y65c ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">2:00. German schools operated on Saturday mornings, and Ruth was </div><div class="t m164e x71 h27 y1731 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sure the authorities would not want Heinz to miss classes. </div><div class="t m112f x74 h27 y14d4 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The social worker asked Ruth to think about it. A few days later the </div><div class="t m1ae5 x71 h27 y149e ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">social worker returned with permission for Ruth to take any child in her </div><div class="t m1064 x71 h27 y1231 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">care out of school on Saturdays to attend church with her. Ruth knew </div><div class="t m12df x71 h27 y1026 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">God wanted her to take this boy. </div><div class="t m113a x61 h27 y1262 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Heinz lived with Ruth for two years. He attended church with her, </div><div class="t m2d74 x71 h27 y97e ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">but never really showed an interest in religion. When he was 15 he left </div><div class="t m1ba2 x26 h27 yb0e ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">her home to attend a technical school to study carpentry. Writing was </div><div class="t m1911 x26 h27 ya03 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">difficult for him, and he seldom wrote to her, but he visited her once or </div><div class="t m2144 x26 h27 y139e ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">twice a year. She was always glad to see him, and prayed for him every </div><div class="t m1c90 x26 h27 y7d4 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">day. She knew he was a troubled, lonely boy. </div><div class="t m2685 x61 h27 ya91 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">One day Heinz came to visit Ruth and asked her where the Adventist </div><div class="t m16a7 x26 h27 yde1 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">church in his city was. Surprised, Ruth gave him the address. </div><div class="t m1304 x61 h27 yd24 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Some time later a group of Pathfinders stayed with Ruth while they </div><div class="t m1a34 x26 h27 y14e3 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">toured the area. Heinz was visiting her at the time, and the Pathfinders </div><div class="t m42b x26 h27 ydb6 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">invited Ruth and Heinz to join them on Sabbath. The group&apos;s pastor </div><div class="t mdbd x26 h27 y12b4 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">held a baptism that day and asked if anyone would like to prepare for </div><div class="t m183e x26 h27 ya16 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">baptism. Heinz stood up! Ruth contacted a pastor from the area where </div><div class="t m946 x26 h27 y475 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Heinz lived and asked him to visit Heinz. He did, and Heinz was </div><div class="t m192d x9c h27 y79b ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">eventually baptized. </div><div class="t m322 x9e h27 y514 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Ruth remembers that she almost did not </div><div class="t m186b x9c h27 y98b ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">take this troubled teen into her home.
