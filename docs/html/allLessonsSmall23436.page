His greatest </div><div class="t md31 x18 h2d y2a78 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">pleasure after becoming drunk was to ring the church bell in the Orthodox </div><div class="t m1648 x26 h2d y28b5 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">church towerâ€”at one or two in the morning. The community, believing </div><div class="t maf2 x26 h2d y2074 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the bell should be rung at night only if there was an emergency, was </div><div class="t m8d8 x26 h2d y200e ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">angry and asked Stephen&apos;s father to curb his son. </div><div class="t m1cc x59 h2d y761 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Tell me what you want me to buy you so you won&apos;t ring the </div><div class="t m769 x26 h2d y1287 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">bell,&quot; Stephen&apos;s father asked him. &quot;A bicycle,&quot; responded Stephen.

This time </div><div class="t m317 x18 h2d ye47 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the humiliated father bought him a German MZ 12.5 CC motorcycle. For </div><div class="t m8a4 x26 h2d yf26 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">several nights the bell didn&apos;t ring. Then early one dark morning everyone </div><div class="t m7db x18 h2d y104b ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was again awakened by the tolling of the bell.

The pastor firmly told him he would finish his study on Daniel </div><div class="t m6f3 x18 h2d y138a ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">2 before answering his questions. Impressed with history, Stephen </div><div class="t mb34 x18 h2d y7f8 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">enjoyed the study! </div><div class="t m6bf x59 h2d y1d50 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Stephen attended each Bible lesson, and on the nights of the </div><div class="t maac x18 h2d ye1 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Bible study, the community noticed the church bell was silent.
