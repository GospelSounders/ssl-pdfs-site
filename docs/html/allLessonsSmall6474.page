It probably was </div><div class="t m9fa x4 h4 y18d8 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">written in Corinth in the spring of A. D. 57 or 58. It is one of the most </div><div class="t m114 x4 h4 y1aad ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">systematic and comprehensive of religious treatises and withal a mighty </div><div class="t m6ad x4 h4 y18c0 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">appeal. It sets forth man&apos;s sinful and lost condition, whatever his race </div><div class="t m247 x4 h4 y1f9a ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">or pretension, his hopelessness without God, and God&apos;s mercy in jus-</div><div class="t m618 x4 h4 y1956 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tification through Christ Jesus. It shows how God can be just, and yet </div><div class="t m7aa xe h4 y1a44 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">justify the believing sinner ; not that he may ,continue in sin, but that </div><div class="t m1b8 x4 h4 y18b2 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">he may develop a sinless, Christian character. While a profound book, </div><div class="t m149 x4 h4 y1b29 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">it is not difficult for the heart of faith to apprehend. </div><div class="t mdcb x26 h4 y1bad ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Study the book, its chapters, its sections, its verses, its clauses, its </div><div class="t m3de x4 h4 y1d96 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">phrases, its words. Do not hurry. Do not seek to give a whole verse for </div><div class="t m1ad x4 h4 y1e36 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">an answer to a question when a word will suffice. Use only that part of </div><div class="t mf3c xe h4 y2180 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the scripture necessary to answer the question. Get all you can out of the </div><div class="t m5e6 xe h4 y10d3 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">words of life. Review often. Remember the &quot;therefores&quot; and &quot;where-</div><div class="t m44e x4 h4 y1be0 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">fores ;&quot; and find the reasons for their use.
