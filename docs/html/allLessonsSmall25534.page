With time on his hands, he began looking for </div><div class="t m682 x26 h27 y2883 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">new friends and interesting things to do. He became involved with </div><div class="t m35b x26 h27 y2035 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">some young people who worshiped Satan. They taught him how to </div><div class="t m10f4 x26 h27 y2017 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">call up demons, and he soon won their respect, for he seemed to </div><div class="t m1897 x18 h27 y372 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">have great psychic power. </div><div class="t mea3 x64 h27 y5ea ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The young people spent their time smoking marijuana, drink-</div><div class="t m275 x18 h27 y227 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ing, and listening to hard rock music. Josef bought a motorcycle so </div><div class="t m10f4 x18 h27 y15b6 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">he could ride with his friends. But a serious accident nearly cost </div><div class="t m362 x18 h27 y15c7 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">him his life when a piece of flying debris cut a long gash in his </div><div class="t m1f7 x18 h27 y5ce ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">neck, and he nearly bled to death. The doctor who cared for him </div><div class="t m1a11 x18 h27 y1ca ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">told him he was lucky to be alive. &quot;You should have died beside </div><div class="t m8a7 x18 h27 y435 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the road,&quot; he told Josef solemnly. But Josef paid little attention. </div><div class="t mb44 x18 h27 y316 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">He did not believe in God. </div><div class="t mce6 x64 h27 y595 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Just weeks after his near-fatal accident, Josef was again riding </div><div class="t m2ff x18 h27 y489 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">his motorcycle. Then one day as he sped down a road, he lost </div><div class="t m1138 x18 h27 yfc ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">control and hit a pole, tearing his motorcycle apart and throwing </div><div class="t m320 x18 h27 y6ed ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">him into a ditch. But he climbed out of the ditch with barely a </div><div class="t m3f0 x18 h27 y8f7 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">scratch. His friends began calling him Lucky, but Josef began to </div><div class="t m116b x18 h27 y2ba ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">think that maybe something—or Someone—had saved his life. </div><div class="t m7f1 x18 h27 ycf7 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">But why? Was God trying to tell him something? </div><div class="t m13aa x29 h27 y1a1 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Josef knew nothing about religion; he felt he needed to learn if </div><div class="t m10f6 x4a h27 y134c ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">God exists and what God wanted from him. He had no idea which </div><div class="t m559 x4a h27 y451 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">church to attend, so he looked up a friend who was a Christian. </div><div class="t maf3 x4a h27 y28b ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Josef talked to him about religion and began attending church and </div><div class="t m2f6 x4a h27 ye4 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">studying the Bible with him. </div><div class="t ma2a x29 h27 yc0 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The devil was not willing to let Josef go without a struggle.
