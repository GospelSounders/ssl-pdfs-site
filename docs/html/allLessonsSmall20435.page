The scenario that followed showed the </div><div class="t m67 x74 h1c y2ee4 ff2 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">powerlessness of the heathen gods and brought prominence to the true God. </div><div class="t m45c x60 h1 y2b37 ff1 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">3. A Hasty Decree (Dan. 2:12, 13). </div><div class="t mab7 x60 h1c y2ccb ff2 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">One question immediately arises: Where was Daniel at this time? How was it </div><div class="t m410 x74 h1c y2cb3 ff2 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that he and his companions were not at the court with the rest of the learned elite? </div><div class="t m373 x4e h1c y28c0 ff2 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">A number of suggestions have been made: </div><div class="t m1665 x60 h1c y2882 ff2 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">1. </div><div class="t m3e6 x83 h1c y2882 ff2 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">This situation arose before Daniel had graduated from his school. But the </div><div class="t m625 x74 h1c y23c2 ff2 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">fact that Daniel was to be slain with the others, suggests that he was a full mem-</div><div class="t m17d x74 h1c y2354 ff2 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ber of the group. </div><div class="t ma69 x4e h1c yd50 ff2 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">2. </div><div class="t m1b5 x65 h1c yd50 ff2 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Those responsible for issuing the kings&apos; summons purposely left Daniel </div><div class="t m287 x74 h1c y1823 ff2 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and his companions out of the reckoning. The summons was not delivered be-</div><div class="t mb05 x74 h1c y191e ff2 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">cause of the jealousy of the other counselors. They wanted to use the occasion </div><div class="t mb1b x74 h1c y1033 ff2 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">for their own benefit. If this were their scheme and motive they certainly did not </div><div class="t m85e x74 h1c y1e2a ff2 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">deserve any mercy, certainly not from the &quot;captives.&quot; However, Daniel showed </div><div class="t mae3 x74 h1c y1999 ff2 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">an exemplary spirit by contrast, in that he was anxious to save the lives of his </div><div class="t m9c6 x74 h1c y1765 ff2 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">fellow counselors. </div><div class="t m9b8 x4e h1c y197b ff2 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">3. </div><div class="t m6c5 x65 h1c y197b ff2 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Daniel and his companions may have been engaged in a regular prayer or </div><div class="t m7d0 x74 h1c y193c ff2 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">worship service that the Babylonians did not want to interrupt. </div><div class="t m3d1 x4e h1c y121 ff2 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Whatever may have been the reason, it is obvious that it was providential. In </div><div class="t m7e4 x74 h1c y1b7 ff2 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">this way the inability of the heathen counselors to accede to the king&apos;s request </div><div class="t ma1d x74 h1c y1780 ff2 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was made more noticeable. </div><div class="t m1e69 x74 h20 y17f1 ff3 fs10 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">II. </div><div class="t m6c x34 h1 y17f1 ff1 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">THE INTERPRETATION.
