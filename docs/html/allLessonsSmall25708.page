The rain-rutted </div><div class="t mb35 x71 h28 y123d ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">roads made travel painful at best. Halfway to our destination we were </div><div class="t m134d x71 h28 y1068 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">stopped by a roadblock.

I wrapped the baby boy in my bath towel while George </div><div class="t mddc x71 h28 y10e7 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">worked on the little girl.
