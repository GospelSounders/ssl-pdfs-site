The </div><div class="t ma2d x4a h2d y2d06 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">great descent of Christ from God to man is given in Philippians 2:5-8. The </div><div class="t m310 x14 h2d y2ab5 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ultimate humility is revealed in the words &quot;He humbled himself by living a </div><div class="t m77a x14 h2d y2b32 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">life of utter obedience, to the point of death, and the death He died was the </div><div class="t m119f x4a h2d y2af1 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">death of a common criminal&quot; (verse 8, Phillips). </div><div class="t m1f7 x64 h2d y29c5 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Think of the emotions that must have surged through Judas&apos; mind as Jesus </div><div class="t m8df x14 h2d y28dd ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">washed his feet. For thirty pieces of silver Judas was about to hand Jesus </div><div class="t m6a0 x4a h2d y2217 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">over to the Jewish authorities. Nevertheless, the Messiah, who knew what </div><div class="t m39f x14 h2d y2077 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Judas had done, instead of exposing him, stooped to wash his feet. The </div><div class="t m7eb x14 h2d y4f8 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">power of Christ&apos;s love brought powerful conviction for Judas to confess his </div><div class="t m43d x14 h2d y1c83 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sin. Tragically he rejected it. In his estimation, no one who would adopt the </div><div class="t mddc x14 h2d y20d3 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">position of an unimportant servant was worthy of his adoration. He deter-</div><div class="t m40e x14 h2d y1550 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">mined to go through with his plan to betray Jesus and thereby lost eternal </div><div class="t m6a3 x14 h2d y1e23 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">life. </div><div class="t m5a0 x64 h2d yca9 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Peter&apos;s reaction was different. He was overwhelmed by His Lord&apos;s bend-</div><div class="t m7e9 x14 h2d y1085 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ing so low as to wash his feet. He was ashamed that he was not doing what </div><div class="t m117f x14 h2d y15bd ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Jesus was doing. He sensed that his personal pride had kept him from being </div><div class="t m35a x14 h2d y1137 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">a servant.

This was of far more conse-</div><div class="t mef x14 h2d y14c8 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">quence than the washing of their dusty feet. With the spirit they then had, </div><div class="t m1364 x14 h2d y14f5 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">not one of them was prepared for communion with Christ.
