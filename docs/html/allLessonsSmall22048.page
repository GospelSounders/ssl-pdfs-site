We resist them, we </div><div class="t m86c x27 h2d y2392 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">resent them, and sometimes we reject them. </div><div class="t m6a x48 h2d y18f8 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The stories we will consider during this series are about changes in the lives </div><div class="t m84b x27 h2d y1f53 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of God&apos;s people, and how they related to them. The period between the judges </div><div class="t m93f x27 h2d y7c6 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and the early monarchy covered in the books of Samuel were times of transition </div><div class="t m778 x27 h2d y14ef ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and change, times of political unrest and conflict in Israel and in the surrounding </div><div class="t maa7 x27 h2d y13b9 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">nations. The twelve tribes, initially bound together in a sort of loose confederacy, </div><div class="t me0a x27 h2d y13ba ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">had no central government. &quot;In those days there was no king in Israel: everyone </div><div class="t m667 x27 h2d y15c7 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">did what was right in his own eyes&quot; (Judges 21:25, NKJV). With the emergence </div><div class="t m400 x27 h2d y1c9 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of the kingship, adaptation and adjustment did not always take place smoothly. </div><div class="t m412 x27 h2d y315 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Serious conflicts had to be resolved, sometimes with tragic consequences. </div><div class="t m316 x14 h2d y199b ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The narratives in Samuel not only describe one crisis after another in Israel but </div><div class="t m4f x27 h2d y10c4 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">they reveal individual people in crisis, men and women like ourselvesâ€”Hannah, </div><div class="t m31f x27 h2d y83a ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Eli, Samuel, Saul, and David. Thus the books of Samuel deal with the same kind </div><div class="t maff x27 h2d y7ac ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of challenges that continue to face us some thirty centuries later: the challenge of </div><div class="t mdef x11 h2d y103a ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">trusting versus distrusting God; the challenge of divine will versus human inclina-</div><div class="t m88a x11 h2d y1c5b ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tion; the challenge of human relationships and sometimes untamed emotions; the </div><div class="t mf44 x27 h2d y193e ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">challenge of spiritual leadership versus the prostitution of sacred office. </div><div class="t m247 x5d h2d y195b ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">First and Second Samuel appear as one book in the ancient Hebrew </div><div class="t mda9 x11 h2d y11c5 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">manuscripts. Samuel could not have authored all of the book bearing his name, </div><div class="t m436 x11 h2d y2124 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">because he died before the end of the first book.

He sought not mere outward or </div><div class="t m119c x11 h2d y1fa9 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">formal compliance, but a faith that internalizes His law in the heart and </div><div class="t m5c9 x11 h2d y486 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">demonstrates it in the life, a faith that acknowledges sin, accepts forgiveness, and </div><div class="t mc6 x11 h2d y13 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">forsakes sin. </div><div class="t m5c3 x5d h2d y5d9 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">It is that kind of faith in the face of change, crisis, and challenge that is so </div><div class="t m115e x11 h2d y645 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">much needed in the lives of God&apos;s people today.
