He believed in the gods of </div><div class="t m5d2 x17 h28 y2ad3 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the mountains, the rocks, the trees, the sun, the harvest; but he </div><div class="t m23e x17 h28 y23aa ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">did not believe in the God of the universe. He would laugh at </div><div class="t m3d2 x17 h28 y44a ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">his three wives when he caught them praying, and often tried </div><div class="t m8e x17 h28 y15b5 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to pry their eyes open in an attempt to stop their prayers. </div><div class="t m224 x48 h28 y954 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">One night Datu Mangol had a dream. He saw a narrow path </div><div class="t m1d2 x17 h28 y20d3 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">with boiling water on one side and fire on the other. He heard a </div><div class="t m411 x17 h28 y1033 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">voice instructing him to walk on the narrow path. Frightened, he </div><div class="t m443 x17 h28 y1ae4 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">hesitated, but the voice urged him to walk in faith, for the God of </div><div class="t m698 x17 h28 y854 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the universe would keep him from falling. Still frightened, Datu </div><div class="t m698 x17 h28 y4dd ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Mangol decided to go home and prepare for his journey, but the </div><div class="t m47 x3e h28 y1aed ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">voice compelled him to begin his journey at once. </div><div class="t mb9b x48 h28 y1768 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">He began to walk, and soon found himself standing on a </div><div class="t m9e3 x3e h28 y1df7 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">crossroad, where roads stretched out in every direction. On one </div><div class="t ma79 x3e h28 yc6c ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">road he could see a church. The voice asked him which road he </div><div class="t m3f5 x3e h28 yad3 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">should take, and Datu Mangol said, &quot;The road to the church.&quot; The </div><div class="t m5e1 x3e h28 ydb2 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">voice assured him that was the way God wanted him to go. </div><div class="t m2b2 x48 h28 y1f38 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">In Datu Mangol&apos;s society dreams have great significance. </div><div class="t mb8d x3e h28 yb9b ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Datu Mangol studied his dream carefully to determine the </div><div class="t m9e9 x3e h28 y1940 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">meaning.

Datu resolved to attend the </div><div class="t mace x3e h28 y141e ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">baptism.
