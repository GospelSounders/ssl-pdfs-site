Jerry Fernandez was </div><div class="t mf32 x71 h27 y23fb ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">assigned to a large church near the campus. Although the church </div><div class="t m1178 x71 h27 y2344 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">had four hundred members, it was not growing. </div><div class="t m26b x61 h27 y1feb ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">As Thirteenth Sabbath approached, Jerry prepared for the Com-</div><div class="t me55 x71 h27 ycfa ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">munion service. He learned that two of the local elders were in-</div><div class="t m176c x26 h27 y14e6 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">volved in a dispute over a strip of land that lay between their farms. </div><div class="t m1e16 x26 h27 y7c8 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The disagreement had become heated, and one man called the other </div><div class="t mbb x26 h27 y1017 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">a liar and a thief. The second man stopped attending church. How </div><div class="t m3f7 x26 h27 ya0d ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">could he worship with the man who had attacked him? </div><div class="t m1be8 x29 h27 y50f ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Jerry felt that he had to visit the men. But he was barely twenty </div><div class="t m1147 x26 h27 yaa9 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">years old, and the two men were in their sixties. Jeny knew that he </div><div class="t m19d6 x26 h27 ydc7 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">needed the help of the Holy Spirit in order to reconcile these brothers. </div><div class="t m1347 x64 h27 y1138 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Jerry visited the first elder and counseled him to surrender the </div><div class="t ma96 x26 h27 ybcf ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">disputed land to his neighbor and to wash his brother&apos;s feet on </div><div class="t m374 x26 h27 y1f98 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Sabbath. Finally the elder agreed. &quot;Jesus will be waiting for you at </div><div class="t m388 x26 h27 ye0c ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">church,&quot; Jerry promised. </div><div class="t m136a x64 h27 yad5 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Then Jerry visited the second man and made a similar appeal. </div><div class="t m8d8 x26 h27 y14a0 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">But the man resisted, &quot;He called me a liar and a thief! He should </div><div class="t m14b6 x26 h27 y981 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">make this right first.&quot; Jerry gently pleaded with the man to forgive </div><div class="t md0d x26 h27 y95b ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">his brother and come to the Communion service. &quot;Jesus wants you </div><div class="t m770 x26 h27 y7f9 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to come,&quot; Jerry said. But the man would not promise. </div><div class="t me06 x64 h27 y3a5 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">On Sabbath morning Jerry hiked the three miles to his church. </div><div class="t m1499 x18 h27 y895 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">He found the first elder waiting for him. But as time for church </div><div class="t m137a x18 h27 yc7e ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">neared, Jerry became concerned. The second elder had not come. </div><div class="t m67b x64 h27 yf3e ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Jerry borrowed a bicycle and rode to the home of the second </div><div class="t mdef x18 h27 yd0e ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">elder. &quot;Brother,&quot; he pleaded, &quot;we are waiting for you. Today is the </div><div class="t m165e x18 h27 yee5 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">day to make things right.&quot; The older man repeated his reasons for </div><div class="t m857 x18 h27 yb82 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">not coming, but Jerry kindly persisted. &quot;The Lord Jesus will be </div><div class="t m383 x18 h27 ya18 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">disappointed if you do not come.&quot; </div><div class="t m1355 x64 h27 y103d ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Finally the elder agreed. The man got on the bicycle, and Jerry </div><div class="t m190c x18 h27 y72d ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">pedaled back to the church. When they arrived, Jerry took the two </div><div class="t md00 x18 h27 y9f9 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">men into the banana patch behind the church. While the two men </div><div class="t m250 x18 h27 yd14 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">faced each other, Jerry took their hands and prayed for them. </div><div class="t m5f1 x29 h27 yb89 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The reconciliation sparked a revival in the church, and soon the </div><div class="t md13 x4a h27 ya1d ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">church was crowded with worshipers. The congregation built a </div><div class="t m678 x4a h27 yd67 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">larger church around the old building. The membership continues </div><div class="t mce6 x18 h27 y1835 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to grow, in part because of a peacemaking young pastor. </div><div class="t m1494 x29 h6c ybc2 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">J.
