While </div><div class="t mc4 x3e h27 y2889 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">on a training mission thousands of feet above the ground, he </div><div class="t me81 x16 h27 y1fe0 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">moved toward the plane&apos;s door, ready to jump when his com-</div><div class="t m134 x16 h27 y17e4 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">mander gave the signal. When he saw the signal to jump, he </div><div class="t m309 x16 h27 y1f1a ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">pushed himself away from the plane and yanked on his parachute </div><div class="t m361 x16 h27 y1dd3 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">cord. But another paratrooper had jumped at nearly the same in-</div><div class="t mebe x16 h27 y1796 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">stant. Both men&apos;s parachutes opened at the same time.

In an instant Mark sensed that he </div><div class="t ma19 x16 h27 y1671 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was facing death and he was not prepared. He had no idea what lay </div><div class="t mec3 x16 h27 y1daf ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">beyond the grave. After what seemed like an eternity, the men </div><div class="t m758 x16 h27 y1818 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">were able to separate their parachutes.

He became a regular listener and </div><div class="t m431 x71 h27 y320 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">requested a Bible correspondence course.
