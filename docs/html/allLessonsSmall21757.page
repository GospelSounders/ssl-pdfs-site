Very likely his opponents challenged the authentic-</div><div class="t m1ec x14 h27 y1168 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ity of his apostleship on the ground that the twelve apostles knew Christ </div><div class="t m137c x14 h27 y18dc ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">personally and had been commissioned by Him. In answer, Paul insisted </div><div class="t mec7 x14 h27 y164a ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that he had met Christ on the Damascus road, and that Christ gave him his </div><div class="t m55d x14 h27 y1ab1 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">commission at that time. His divine appointment not only is the theme of </div><div class="t m192a x14 h27 y21f0 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the first verse of Galatians but also of the entire first chapter. </div><div class="t m13aa x36 h87 y19b4 ff1 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Apostolic authority. </div><div class="t m43a x77 h27 y683 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The Greek word translated &quot;apostle&quot; means a </div><div class="t mec5 x14 h27 y2118 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">delegate, envoy, or messenger—one who is sent. In a sense every Christian </div><div class="t m57f x14 h27 y1af5 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">believer is a messenger for Jesus Christ. Nevertheless, distinct apostolic </div><div class="t m643 x14 h27 y1897 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">authority was bestowed upon those whom Jesus called to lead the church </div><div class="t m1654 x14 h27 y19fe ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and to whom He gave special revelations of Himself and the Father. Paul </div><div class="t m5f5 x14 h27 y1ab6 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">linked his apostolic authority to the inspired revelations that had been </div><div class="t m162b x14 h27 y1829 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">given him.
