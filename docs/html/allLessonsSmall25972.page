But during his later teen years </div><div class="t m14c1 x4a h27 y23fd ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Chinsisi dropped out of school before he graduated.

As members of the group expressed personal needs, </div><div class="t mad1 x14 h27 yd3e ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">others in the group prayed for them by name. </div><div class="t m1084 x36 h27 yd25 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">During this time of sharing, Yami told the group of his burden </div><div class="t m63b x14 h27 ydfb ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">for his brother Chinsisi, who had been the spiritual influence that </div><div class="t me1a x14 h27 ydb7 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">had brought him to Christ.

He asked his friends to pray </div><div class="t mec5 x14 h27 ya98 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that Chinsisi would come home.
