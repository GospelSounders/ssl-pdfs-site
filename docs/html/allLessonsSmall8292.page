Jesus was given to stand at the head of humanity, </div><div class="t mccf x11 he y1165 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that by His example He might teach what it means to minister. His whole </div><div class="t m6ec x11 he y2005 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">life was under a law of service. He served all, ministered to all.
