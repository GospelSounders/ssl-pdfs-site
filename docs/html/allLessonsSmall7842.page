God wants us to know that holiness is not communicated to that </div><div class="t m7f4 x3 he y2386 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">which is unclean in itself because the one who does the unclean thing is carry-</div><div class="t m7d8 x3 he y1f5f ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ing on a holy work. One good deed does not cover over another evil deed. </div><div class="t m6e5 x16 he y346 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">A good illustration of the attitude here portrayed is found in the parable </div><div class="t m14b6 x3 he y166c ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of the Pharisee who thanked God that he was not as other men. Luke 18:11, 12. </div><div class="t m78e xbd he y1f46 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Surely, he thought, these good deeds ought to commend him to God. </div><div class="t mb1e x16 he y1987 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">To illustrate further: The tithe is holy, even as the flesh which the priest </div><div class="t m469 xbd he y1954 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">carried was holy. Does the fact that a man pays tithe, or that he receives tithe, </div><div class="t m14bb xbd he y1a64 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sanctify all that he does? If such a man touches the unclean, if he does what </div><div class="t md0f xbd he y16f5 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">he ought not to do, if he does an unclean thing, is that thing sanctified because </div><div class="t m810 xbd he y5e0 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">it is done by a man who carries or receives that which is holy? There are </div><div class="t m377 xbd he yb97 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">those who think so, and would like to have the law thus interpreted. But let </div><div class="t m64c xbd he y193c ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">all know that an unclean thing is not condoned, not sanctified, not overlooked, </div><div class="t m865 xbd he ya25 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">because a man is engaged in a holy cause. Sin is sin whoever commits it, and </div><div class="t mc6b xbd he y1df7 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">no amount of good which a man may have done will condone any wrong-</div><div class="t m4c8 xbd he yb98 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">doing. The unclean act is not made clean by being committed by one who </div><div class="t m779 xbd he y173c ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">carries &quot;holy flesh.&quot; </div><div class="t m326 x71 h1 y173d ff1 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">6. </div><div class="t m1063 x73 h1 y34b ff1 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">What did God say was the condition of that which they offered? </div><div class="t m1dc x4 h1 yc20 ff1 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Haggai 2:14, last part. </div><div class="t maac x16 he ya82 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">NoTE.—The remnant was at this time engaged in a meritorious work, that </div><div class="t mae7 x4 he y1a74 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of rebuilding the temple. But apparently things were not as they should be. </div><div class="t m1f2 x4 he y16b4 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">That which they offered was unclean, and was not acceptable to God. This </div><div class="t m575 x4 he ydeb ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">does not mean that they offered unclean animals, but that their lives were </div><div class="t m64d x4 he y12c ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">not clean, and that hence their worship was not accepted of God. </div><div class="t m2b0 x71 he y168b ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">God had spoken very plainly to them that they were to consider their </div><div class="t m2c0 x4 he yb3c ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ways.
