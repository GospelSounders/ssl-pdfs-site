She </div><div class="t m132f x71 h28 y2af2 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">wanted to talk with Him, to receive His guidance, but her growing </div><div class="t ma2d x71 h28 y2945 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">awareness of her own sinfulness troubled her. How could she ever </div><div class="t m31d x71 h28 y2294 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">be good enough to approach this mighty God? </div><div class="t m391 x61 h28 y1eac ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">When the pastor visited her, she asked him to teach her how to </div><div class="t m55c x26 h28 y107f ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">pray. Soon she made her first feeble attempts to communicate with </div><div class="t m9b4 x71 h28 y1350 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">her Creator. Other Christians shared their faith with her, prayed </div><div class="t mc0 x26 h28 y1f01 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">for her, and encouraged her in her steps of faith. </div><div class="t m22b x61 h28 y1081 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Drathai&apos;s parents had seen the letters that came to their daugh-</div><div class="t m9b4 x26 h28 y1367 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ter from the Bible correspondence school. They appreciated the </div><div class="t m112 x26 h28 y144d ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">positive influence of her Christian friends. But they did not </div><div class="t mf1 x26 h28 y13bc ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">realize the depth of interest Drathai had in Christianity. </div><div class="t m264 x61 h28 y1528 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Drathai decided to follow Jesus and be baptized. She knew that </div><div class="t ma6e x26 h28 y116e ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">her parents would try to stop her, so she was baptized secretly in </div><div class="t m84d x26 h28 y11a2 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the nearby river. When her parents learned of her baptism, her </div><div class="t m14c4 x26 h28 y10cf ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">mother cried bitterly. &quot;The spirits will punish us because you no </div><div class="t m34b x26 h28 y15bf ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">longer worship them!&quot; her mother cried. &quot;Please bow with me to </div><div class="t m1331 x26 h28 y1358 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the ancestors!&quot; Drathai quietly refused, explaining that a Christian </div><div class="t m391 x26 h28 y1337 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">can have no other gods save the God of heaven. </div><div class="t m7f3 x64 h28 y1e3d ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Friends also scolded her. &quot;You have been brainwashed!
