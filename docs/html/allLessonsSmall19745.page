He presents this thought in different </div><div class="t m455 x74 h2d y233f ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">words, sometimes briefly, sometimes in a more extended fashion. It is his </div><div class="t m3af x74 h2d y21bf ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">way of saying &quot;God be with you.&quot; In its extended form it is the well-</div><div class="t ma95 x74 h2d y2173 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">known grace employed as a benediction (2 Cor. 13:14). To the Roman </div><div class="t mb56 x74 h2d y1434 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">church he repeats the blessing (Rom. 16:20, 24); and to the Colossians </div><div class="t m476 x74 h2d y191e ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and in both epistles to Timothy the shortest benediction is found: &quot;Grace </div><div class="t me59 x74 h2d y1e29 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">be with you&quot; (1 Tim. 6:21; 2 Tim. 4:22, NKJV). </div><div class="t mac4 x4e h2d y1a89 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">What better termination could there be to an epistle which begins with </div><div class="t mb84 x74 h2d y1647 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Grace, mercy, and peace, from God the Father and Christ Jesus our </div><div class="t m65e x74 h2d y1562 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Lord&quot; (2 Tim. 1:2)? Paul not only ends his epistles with benedictions of </div><div class="t m2d5 x73 h2d y1a8a ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">grace, but he also opens them with the same greeting, allying grace with </div><div class="t mda x74 h2d y1958 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">peace always, and sometimes with mercy. And in between the opening </div><div class="t m6bf x73 h2d y1959 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and closing statements are messages full of grace and its marvelous riches </div><div class="t m59d x73 h2d y10c8 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and power in transforming lives. </div><div class="t ma3 x4e h2d y195a ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">As it happened, his final benediction—&quot;Grace be with you. Amen. &quot;—</div><div class="t m328 x74 h2d y1dec ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was his final good-bye to Timothy, to his other fellow workers, and to the </div><div class="t mb1e x74 h2d y10d5 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">world. But it was good-bye until he would meet them again in glory at the </div><div class="t m6a0 x73 h2d y129f ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">coming of his Lord. </div><div class="t mf66 x4e h6c y1b65 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">How much grace is available to all? James 4:5-8. </div><div class="t m1464 x28 h2d y222b ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The grace of God is available to all, but it is &quot;given&quot; to those who are </div><div class="t m3d1 x73 h2d y10f2 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">friends of God, although this is not a once-for-all gift. Resisting the devil </div><div class="t m85c x73 h2d y1ca8 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and submitting to God (verse 7) is a work that requires grace added to </div><div class="t me5c x73 h2d y195e ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">grace. This suggests that there is an illimitable supply from which we can </div><div class="t mb0f x73 h2d y2148 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">obtain sufficient for our needs. The apostle Paul himself was afflicted by </div><div class="t m73f x73 h2d y1960 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet&quot; him (2 Cor. 12:7). </div><div class="t m856 x73 h2d y642 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Three times he asked the Lord to remove it, but he received this answer: </div><div class="t m32e x73 h2d y1962 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;My grace is sufficient for thee&quot; (verse 9). The obstacle, therefore, was </div><div class="t m6f9 x73 h2d y1146 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">not of such besetting power that the grace of God could not overcome it </div><div class="t m9f x73 h2d y1715 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in his life. From this intimate experience he counseled Timothy to &quot;be </div><div class="t m78b x48 h2d y1a99 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus&quot; (2 Tim. 2:1). To be strong in </div><div class="t m415 x48 h2d y1c0f ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">certain characteristics is to possess them in large measure, to be expert in </div><div class="t m648 x48 h2d y1966 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">a certain talent, to excel at certain abilities. To &quot;be strong in the grace&quot; </div><div class="t m577 x48 h2d y1c97 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">means to be capable of using grace in a large way, to fight successfully the </div><div class="t mb90 x48 h2d y18d3 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">battles of the Lord, and to defeat Satan by the unending supplies of grace </div><div class="t m2eb x48 h2d y1e65 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">from the Lord Jesus Christ. </div><div class="t m853 x28 h2d y172f ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Paul was &quot;strong in the grace.&quot; His faith &quot;made strong by effort and </div><div class="t mf3c x73 h2d y1a9e ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">pure by sacrifice, upheld and strengthened </div><div class="t m6a8 x23 h4a y142d ff6 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">him.&quot;—Gospel Workers, </div><div class="t m1 x149 h2d y6ba ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">p. </div><div class="t mddc x48 h2d y1c3d ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">108.
