They often cite passages like Psalm 90:4 in </div><div class="t m758 xe h28 ya0c ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">support of their position.

This </div><div class="t md0c xe h28 y662 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">is done only when a 24-hour day is intended. Another is that the days </div><div class="t mb27 xe h28 y569 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">are set off by the expression &quot;and there was evening, and there was </div><div class="t m42f xe h28 yb79 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">monting&quot;(NIV). Again, this is done in Hebrew only when a literal 24-</div><div class="t mb5 xe h28 ya2e ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">hour day is meant.
