Our planet </div><div class="t mb07 x71 h28 y2cdd ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was isolated in rebellion. Its inhabitants had been infected with sin. The </div><div class="t mf49 x71 h28 y2a25 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">survival of the human race was in doubt. Communication had been </div><div class="t mb36 x71 h28 y2a95 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">limited, and a great gulf separated human beings from God. An impen-</div><div class="t m8e0 x71 h28 y28f3 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">etrable gloom enshrouded the globe. To all appearances the rebels were </div><div class="t mcfe x71 h28 y23f5 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">without hope, without remedy. </div><div class="t m86f x48 h28 y2319 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">To bridge the gulf a mediator was needed who could provide a way </div><div class="t m1329 x71 h28 y1fed ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">back to God—someone in between, someone who could bring the es-</div><div class="t m377 x71 h28 ya83 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tranged parties together. In the desperate situation God took the initia-</div><div class="t maa3 x71 h28 y11d1 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tive. Christ was provided as Mediator. He alone had the proper creden-</div><div class="t med9 x71 h28 ydd9 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tials and credibility to be able to guarantee results, to speak to both sides </div><div class="t m5d1 x71 h28 yd6b ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and to draw fallen human beings back into fellowship with God. In order </div><div class="t m9fd x71 h28 yfe0 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to do so He had to be willing to pay the price, no matter how high it would </div><div class="t m1662 x71 h28 y1240 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">be. Being interested in us in a most personal way, He was determined not </div><div class="t m10ff x26 h28 y1882 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to fail or become discouraged in His intervention on our behalf. </div><div class="t m371 x73 h28 y1273 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The Mediator has acted and continues to act in our behalf. Most of His </div><div class="t m1f5 x26 h28 ydf3 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">primary mission has been accomplished. Planet Earth rightfully is His. </div><div class="t mcdc x26 h28 ybb1 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The broken relationship has been restored. The communication gulf has </div><div class="t m145e x26 h28 ye49 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">been bridged, the gloom has been lifted, and salvation has been provided </div><div class="t me4b x26 h28 y901 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">for those willing to accept it. </div><div class="t m1578 x73 h28 ye4a ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Two more acts in the drama remain—the completion of the investiga-</div><div class="t m252 x26 h28 y1282 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tive judgment and the complete banishment of the instigator, the archen-</div><div class="t mea5 x26 h28 y890 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">emy, the chief rebel and his followers in the fmal executive judgment. </div><div class="t m14da x26 h28 y665 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Annihilation of the root cause will lead to the restoration of the planet to </div><div class="t m305 x26 h28 y9f4 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">what God originally intended it to be. </div><div class="t m6ae x73 h28 y1029 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">For the next thirteen weeks, we will embark on a study journey </div><div class="t m32b x26 h28 y15a4 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">through this grand truth, Jesus our Mediator, and will trace His activity </div><div class="t m4cc x26 h28 y8bc ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and ministry. We will come to know Him better in the many phases of His </div><div class="t mcdb x26 h28 yd25 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">noble efforts to rescue humanity. We will understand more clearly the </div><div class="t m64d x26 h28 ycad ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">way God works and come to experience at deeper levels the impact of </div><div class="t m1289 x26 h28 y56f ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">what He has done and what He is doing—of the great salvation He has </div><div class="t mf1 x26 h28 y1c1a ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">provided. Doing so should enable us to articulate more effectively the </div><div class="t m1f2 x26 h28 y100a ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">essential meaning of the grand old story. No wonder this teaching has </div><div class="t m12a x18 h28 ya4f ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">been called the central doctrine of the Christian faith. It is a key to the </div><div class="t m104 x18 h28 yf46 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">unity of the Bible. In the Mediator, Jesus Christ, God has placed before </div><div class="t me0a x18 h28 y1316 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">His throne our Substitute and Surety. </div><div class="t m38c x74 h28 yb85 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Christianity is a religion of mediation. Ever since the inception of sin, </div><div class="t m863 x18 h28 yf4a ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Jesus has been and continues to be our Mediator with the Father. His </div><div class="t m685 x18 h28 y1030 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">mediation is our only hope of redemption and restoration. </div><div class="t m1330 x74 h28 y9c2 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;God is approached through Jesus Christ, the Mediator, the only way </div><div class="t m9e4 x18 h28 yee9 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">through which He forgives sins. . . .
