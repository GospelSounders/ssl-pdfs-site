As she passed her parents&apos; bedroom, she saw her </div><div class="t m8dd x71 h27 y29ff ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">father sitting on the bed. Isis tiptoed in and gave him a big hug. She </div><div class="t m1dfe x71 h27 y2926 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">flashed a smile and said, &quot;Daddy, I love you! And Jesus loves you, </div><div class="t m1a0d x71 h27 y28be ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">too!&quot; Then she turned and ran from the room, leaving her father alone. </div><div class="t me35 x61 h27 y231b ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Isis&apos;s parents were not Adventists, but they sent their daughter to </div><div class="t m2f5 x71 h27 y4f8 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the Adventist school. There she was learning about God&apos;s love. </div><div class="t m2197 x61 h27 y162d ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Isis&apos;s father worked hard to provide his family with the best things in </div><div class="t m1898 x26 h27 yc76 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">life. But the more they had, the more he wanted, and soon he had trouble </div><div class="t m2685 x26 h27 y1d90 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">paying his bills. He borrowed money to pay his bills, but when he could </div><div class="t m21a5 x26 h27 y1cd0 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">not repay the loan one month the lender threatened to take his house. </div><div class="t me4f x61 h27 y1dd5 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Worried, he borrowed money from another man to pay the lender. </div><div class="t md71 x26 h27 y1169 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">But soon he could not pay the second loan. He felt trapped and faced </div><div class="t m147b x26 h27 y10be ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">losing everything he had worked for. </div><div class="t m40a x61 h27 y1dce ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Father saw only one way out of his problem. His life insurance </div><div class="t m275 x26 h27 y14d5 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">policy would provide enough to pay his bills and leave his family to </div><div class="t m147 x26 h27 y13f4 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">live on for several years. But the only way they could collect that </div><div class="t m15b2 x26 h27 y1564 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">money was if he died. Desperate, Isis&apos;s father decided to end his life. </div><div class="t m1ad9 x26 h27 y11a7 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">He bought a gun and hid it. Then he sat down on the bed to think. </div><div class="t mf6b x64 h27 yf2d ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">But when Isis hugged him, he realized that no matter what hap-</div><div class="t m1dfe x26 h27 y14ab ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">pened, he could not do anything to hurt them! He went to find Isis. </div><div class="t m8e5 x26 h27 yc03 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Honey,&quot; he said, &quot;what did you just say about Jesus?&quot; </div><div class="t m24a x61 h27 y12a2 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Every day my teacher tells us that Jesus loves us,&quot; she answered. </div><div class="t m2f5 x26 h27 y143e ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Come to school with me tomorrow; my teacher will tell you.&quot; </div><div class="t m1609 x64 h27 y10ef ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Daddy did not wait until the next day.

The teacher was not at school, but the principal </div><div class="t m1aeb x26 h27 y1f39 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and the pastor were. As they talked with him, he realized that without </div><div class="t m768 x26 h27 y14c9 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">God in his life, no amount of money could bring him happiness. The </div><div class="t maa5 x26 h27 y18e2 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">pastor offered to study the Bible with him and show him how to find </div><div class="t m800 x77 h27 y1187 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">God. That week the whole family began </div><div class="t m1058 x77 h27 y1315 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">attending the Adventist church. </div><div class="t m15db x80 h27 y1caf ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Isis&apos;s father lost his job, and he had to sell </div><div class="t m1c9a x77 h27 yde4 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">their house.
