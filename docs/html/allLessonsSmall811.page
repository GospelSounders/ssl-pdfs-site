This was not because of God&apos;s unwillingness to </div><div class="t m816 x3 h4 y1b27 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">forgive, but because of his self-righteousness. A man will love in </div><div class="t m428 x3 h4 y1648 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">proportion to what he has been forgiven; but if he is so self-righteous </div><div class="t m6ec x3 h4 y129b ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that he feels little need of forgiveness, of course he will not be moved </div><div class="t m221 x3 h4 y1e35 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to love.

The apostle Paul wrote, &quot; There-</div><div class="t m24c x3 h4 y1b2c ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">fore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our </div><div class="t m9d1 x3 h4 y1efa ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Lord Jesus Christ.&quot; Rom. 5: 1. In this lesson we have a practical </div><div class="t ma35 x3 h4 y129f ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">illustration of that statement. Many who are longing for peace fail </div><div class="t m5a3 x3 h4 y1ff7 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to find it, because they seek for it in the wrong way. They are look-</div><div class="t m2f3 x3 h4 y1e47 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ing for peace as an evidence that they are accepted with God, </div><div class="t mb10 x3 h4 y108b ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">whereas peace comes as the result 2f knowing one&apos;s acceptance with </div><div class="t m1c05 x3 h4 y19b6 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">God. &quot; Being justified, . . . we have peace.&quot; But right here </div><div class="t m744 x3 h4 y1997 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">many still err. They think that peace is merely a state of feeling, </div><div class="t m41e x3 h4 y1e96 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and so they look for a certain indescribable feeling of peace, and if </div><div class="t m418 x3 h4 y1ff8 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">they do not have it, they are in darkness and despondency. Those </div><div class="t m32f x3 h4 yb3e ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">who depend on this feeling will have a fitful experience, and run the </div><div class="t mde3 x3 h4 y1c0d ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">risk of fatal deception. All should understand that peace is not feel-</div><div class="t mbbc x3 h4 y1ff9 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ing, but an actual fact. It is reality, end not imagination or senti-</div><div class="t m1a5 x3 h4 y1dd0 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ment. Peace does not depend on feel ng, and there may be, and </div><div class="t m9f7 x3 h4 y19ff ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">often is, absolute peace with God and no feeling whatever. If this </div><div class="t m265 x3 h4 y1a00 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">were not so, then a knowledge of acceptance with God would be only </div><div class="t mb62 x3 h4 y1314 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">a matter of feeling after all. For if a certain feeling must always </div><div class="t m156 x3 h4 y1962 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">accompany peace, then one would have only to consult his feelings to </div><div class="t mb56 x3 h4 y1ffa ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">know whether or not he is justified, since peace always accompanies </div><div class="t m212 x3 h4 y1360 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">justification. One&apos;s feelings are from himself, but peace with God </div><div class="t m15a x3 h4 y17be ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">comes from God. One can understand his own feelings, even though </div><div class="t mf55 x3 h4 y1adb ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">he cannot describe them; but the peace of God &quot; passeth all under-</div><div class="t m8f8 x3 h4 y1362 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">standing.&quot; Phil. 4: 7. It is God who speaks peace to His people. </div><div class="t m54f x3 h4 y1be6 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Ps. 85 : 8. God is &quot; the God of peace &quot; (Heb. 13: 20), and Christ is </div><div class="t m589 x3 h4 y1a14 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the &quot; Prince of peace&quot; (Isa. 9 : 6.) &quot; He is our peace.&quot; Eph. 2 : 14. </div><div class="t mb8a x3 h4 y1363 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Christ is a real being, and not a mere feeling; and we have peace with </div><div class="t m6a9 x3 h4 y1e6e ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">God only by having Christ, who dwells in our hearts by faith.
