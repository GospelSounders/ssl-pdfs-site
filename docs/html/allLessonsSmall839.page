After his death Joash and the princes of Judah </div><div class="t m9eb x15 h4 y1db1 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">conspired to leave the house of the Lord, and serve idols. Zechariah, </div><div class="t m7ae x15 h4 y116f ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the son of Jehoida, reproved them for transgressing the command-</div><div class="t m72b x15 h4 y13f3 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ments of the Lord, and they stoned him to death. Their murdering </div><div class="t m170 x15 h4 y1ea2 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">him was exactly of the same nature as their idolatry, and was the nat-</div><div class="t m750 x15 h4 y1173 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ural result of it. Therefore all who stubbornly transgress the com-</div><div class="t me0 x15 h4 y13f5 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">mandments of the Lord have murder in their &apos;hearts. The Pharisees </div><div class="t m611 x15 h4 y104d ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and lawyers were rejecting Christ Himself, of whom all the prophets </div><div class="t mf4 x15 h4 y83e ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">testified, and who was greater than all of them together. Therefore </div><div class="t m355 x15 h4 y13f8 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in rejecting Him the blood of all the martyrs came upon them. But </div><div class="t m87f x15 h4 y1cfe ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the same thing is true of all who reject the teaching of Christ, even </div><div class="t m833 x92 h4 y15e4 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">though He is not visibly present. </div><div class="t m1d0 x16 h4 y1cd1 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">6. </div><div class="t m433 x73 h4 y141d ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">THE Pharisees dogged the steps of Christ continually, to find </div><div class="t m56f x92 h4 y19b8 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">some cause of accusation against Him. On this occasion they began to </div><div class="t m5cf x92 h4 y7d7 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">overwhelm Him with questions of the most exasperating nature, in </div><div class="t m159 x15 h4 y1052 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">hopes of provoking Him to a hasty retort. But nothing of the kind </div><div class="t m2ed x92 h4 y1244 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">could they get from His lips. The servant of Christ will often be </div><div class="t m39d x15 h4 y1180 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">placed in similar circumstances. Unreasonable and wicked men, who </div><div class="t m7d6 x15 h4 y1dbc ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">have not faith, will ask questions, not sincerely, but as a trap. There </div><div class="t m148 x92 h4 y138e ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">is where he will need the greatest wisdom. Sometimes it may be best, </div><div class="t m3cc x92 h4 y1184 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">although it will cost the greatest effort, to make no reply. &quot; I said, - </div><div class="t m5ef x92 h4 y1d2d ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I will take heed to my ways, that I sin not with my tongue ; I will </div><div class="t m2af x92 h4 y133d ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">keep my mouth with a bridle, while the wicked is before me. I was </div><div class="t mb67 x92 h4 y110a ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">dumb with silence ; I held my peace, even from good.&quot; Ps. 39 : 1, 2. </div><div class="t mdd1 x92 h4 y201d ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">In all cases he will require more than human wisdom. Indeed, since </div><div class="t m58a x92 h4 yf48 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">no one but Christ has ever given a perfectly discreet answer to every </div><div class="t ma66 x92 h4 y11b3 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">question, it is evident that He alone can do it.
