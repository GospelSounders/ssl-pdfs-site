The energy displayed in the growing plant </div><div class="t m631 x5d he y2008 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">is nothing less than the power of God. That same life is stored up in </div><div class="t ma92 x5d he y1381 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the seed, which forms the food of man; so that our physical food </div><div class="t m1358 x5d he ydac ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">comes as truly from the Lord as did the bread which the five thousand </div><div class="t m15c x5d he y1e3c ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ate. In that case the process of bread making was shortened. Now </div><div class="t m115f x5d he y62f ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">just as God fills the plant with life, of which we partake for the nour-</div><div class="t m1084 x5d he yd94 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ishment of our bodies, </div><div class="t m1d7 x2d he y119c ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">so He fills us with His own life of righteousness, </div><div class="t m10b x5d he y14f2 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">if by faith we receive Him through His word. We cannot understand </div><div class="t m74e x5d he y19d1 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">how any of it is done; but it is no more difficult to believe that God </div><div class="t mb18 x5d he y1cad ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">can work perfection in a man than that He can do it in a plant. </div><div class="t m611 x29 he y1563 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">5. </div><div class="t m446 x34 he y1ed2 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">THE people could not feed themselves; they could not derive any </div><div class="t m6fa x5d he y83c ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">strength from themselves. They, as we and all others are, were en-</div><div class="t me81 x5d he y15e3 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tirely dependent for strength on the food which they ate. Moreover, </div><div class="t md8 x5d he y1488 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">they could not do anything to assist the food to give them strength. </div><div class="t ma8f x5d he yf2d ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">AU that y could do was to eat it as it was provided for them, and • </div><div class="t m5af x5d he y1565 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">then leave .t alone. Why can we not learn the lesson which God de-</div><div class="t m99 x5d he y1eaf ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">signs us tc learn from our daily food? Whether we realize it or not, </div><div class="t mb91 x5d he ya13 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">we deper 1 absolutely on Christ for our life, through the food which </div><div class="t m6f1 x5d he y1553 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">He prov&apos; les us. So we must depend solely on Christ for our right-</div><div class="t m5cf x5d he y418 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">eousness which is real life. If our faith grasps the reality of this </div><div class="t mdf x5d he yd3e ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">miracle,—a miracle that is repeated every day,—then it can grasp the </div><div class="t madf x5d he y1140 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">fact that He can put His life directly into us; and having that, we </div><div class="t m477 x5d he y1657 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">have all.

But Christ says that whosoever wishes to </div><div class="t m3d9 x5d he y74c ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">live must give up his life, and that whoever seeks to save his own life, </div><div class="t m3cd x5d he y13c4 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">shall lose it. The world&apos;s motto is derived from Satan. He had a </div><div class="t mcf6 x5d he y1b70 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">glorious position. But he wanted more, and set about to seize it, and </div><div class="t m593 x5d he y110d ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">as a consequence he lost everything.
