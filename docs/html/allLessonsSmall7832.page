The true prophet is a messenger. And </div><div class="t m2a6 x4 h4 y1298 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">he is in the &quot;message.&quot; While the prophet in a special sense is a messenger, it </div><div class="t m110 x4 h4 y1bf1 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">is also true that every one of God&apos;s people should be a &quot;messenger in the </div><div class="t mef x4 h4 y1648 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Lord&apos;s message.&quot; </div><div class="t m109 x71 h4 y1cf7 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;I am with you.&quot; Haggai had warned and entreated the people.

Even at this time when they had decided to obey </div><div class="t m2d2 x4 h4 y20de ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the voice of the Lord through the prophet, their way was not clear; for there </div><div class="t m610 x4 h4 y17b5 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was a definite decree from King Artaxerxes that the work should cease, and </div><div class="t m1ff x4 h4 y1e2d ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">this decree had not been repealed.

But God wants His people to be in earnest. It is to be noted, how-</div><div class="t ma7c x4 h4 y1edc ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ever, that it is not enough merely to be stirred up. The men whom the Lord </div><div class="t m157 x4 h4 yb48 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">stirred up in the verse before us, became so stirred up that &quot;they came and </div><div class="t ma7c x4 h4 y1bfe ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">did work in the house of the Lord of hosts, their God.&quot; Any stirring up that </div><div class="t m3d0 xe h4 y1d5b ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">is to meet God&apos;s approval must result in going to work.
