When he could not rent the town hall </div><div class="t m5de x5d h87 y18d7 ff1 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">or a school classroom, he offered to rent the saloon. Uncle Elijah, </div><div class="t m8ed x5d h87 y1c5 ff1 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the bartender, accepted the offer, hoping for more business. </div><div class="t me72 x28 h87 y1fe7 ff1 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Lica invited everyone he could find to the meetings.
