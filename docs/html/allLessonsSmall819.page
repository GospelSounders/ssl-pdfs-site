Christ is not </div><div class="t m829 x4 he y16f8 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">only the wisdom of God, but He is the power of God. 1 Cor. 1 : 24. </div><div class="t m319 x4 he y75b ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Faith lays hold on that power and appropriates it. </div><div class="t m104a x11 he y2b6 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">3. </div><div class="t ma95 x14 he y18b5 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">MANY people think that faith is nothing but imagination.

She showed her confidence in their </div><div class="t m3e5 xbd he y1725 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">skill by spending all her living upon them.

In this lesson we have a practical </div><div class="t m271 x4 he yae9 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">example of the reality of the work of faith. </div><div class="t mab2 x11 he y2c7 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">5.
