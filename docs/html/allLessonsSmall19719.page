This lack of mention does not suggest that they were of no </div><div class="t mf95 x5d h2d y2998 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">help to Paul, but their contact with Paul was risky and they may have </div><div class="t mb49 x5d h2d y29ce ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">been in a position that made it extremely dangerous for them to associate </div><div class="t m134 x14 h2d y2ac4 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">openly with a condemned criminal. Nevertheless their being mentioned </div><div class="t m7c9 x5d h2d y2967 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">by name further emphasizes the longing that Paul felt for Timothy. It </div><div class="t m32a x14 h2d y2891 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">seems that the fear that the journey might take too long—for bad weather </div><div class="t m7db x14 h2d y21c6 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">could delay sailings from Ephesus to Rome—and that Paul might die be-</div><div class="t m2bd x14 h2d y227a ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">fore Timothy&apos;s arrival, prompted the writing of the second epistle. Paul&apos;s </div><div class="t mdd x14 h2d y218c ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">earnest plea stresses once more the affection which was more intimite </div><div class="t ma66 x14 h2d y144a ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">than his friendship with Linus and the others. Nevertheless these four </div><div class="t m320 x5d h2d y1951 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">named believers belonged also to the Christian family and can be counted </div><div class="t m426 x14 h2d y1b5a ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">among that vast unnamed legion of faithful believers in Christ. Whether </div><div class="t m7d7 x14 h2d y130a ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Timothy was able to reach Rome before Paul&apos;s death is not made clear in </div><div class="t m8df x14 h2d y1382 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the Bible. But it seems obvious that Paul anticipated that Timothy would </div><div class="t m390 x14 h2d y1648 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">make every effort to do so as a loyal, loving, and obedient son. </div><div class="t m1abc x29 h6c y2011 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">What connection is there between love, duty, and obedience? John 15:14, </div><div class="t m627 x14 h6c y2162 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">15; 13:35. </div><div class="t m89 x64 h2d y635 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The servant is in the house to obey orders and to carry out the wishes </div><div class="t m56f x14 h2d yb30 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of his master. He does not know what course to take without being told </div><div class="t m723 x14 h2d y1ab5 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">because he is not part of the family. The son, however, is part of the </div><div class="t m9d4 x14 h2d y2063 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">household. He knows its ins and outs. He not only has authority subject </div><div class="t m56f x14 h2d y6a4 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to his father, but wisdom to act in an emergency because he is aware of </div><div class="t me9 x14 h2d y1ecd ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">his father&apos;s intentions, and acts as he thinks his father would act. In the </div><div class="t m869 x14 h2d y1ece ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">same way, members of God&apos;s family know His will and perform it be-</div><div class="t m847 x14 h2d y1afb ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">cause they are part of the household.

A life devoted to such </div><div class="t me9a x14 h2d y6ac ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">deeds calls attention to itself, not in an egocentric way, but because of its </div><div class="t m21b x14 h2d y17b9 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">uniqueness. To show love toward the unlovely, to minister kindness to </div><div class="t m722 x14 h2d y19bc ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the ungrateful, to grant rights to the unlawful and the selfish are marks of </div><div class="t m478 x14 h2d y19bd ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">true nobility. Through such unselfish actions the true followers of Christ </div><div class="t mab x14 h2d y19be ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">demonstrate an attitude that will be noted by unbelievers.
