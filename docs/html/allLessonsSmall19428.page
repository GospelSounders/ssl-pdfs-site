But we truly accept God&apos;s forgiveness only when we </div><div class="t m1199 x14 h28 y7e9 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">repent and allow Him to help us change the kind of people we are.

Our hearts must change. Repentance includes not only godly </div><div class="t me4b x14 h28 y1cf1 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sorrow for sin but a turning from it. </div><div class="t m42f x64 h28 y7ca ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;Walking with God&quot; is one image used to convey the concept of our </div><div class="t mdcf x5d h28 ya85 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">intimate experience with the Lord. But the prophet Jeremiah makes it </div><div class="t m1080 x14 h28 ydf2 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">clear that no matter how long we may have walked with God, when sin </div><div class="t m1359 x5d h28 ya42 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">breaks that walk we are out of step with Him. A knowledge of God in-</div><div class="t m166f x14 h28 y200d ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">cludes far more than a mere intellectual understanding of doctrines about </div><div class="t m889 x5d h28 y1262 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Him. We often talk about knowing someone with whom we have not </div><div class="t m356 x5d h28 yc02 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">spoken in years. In the Scriptures, however, knowledge indicates more </div><div class="t m386 x5d h28 y7d1 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">than acquaintanceship. It points to closeness, continual association, and </div><div class="t m310 x5d h28 yb78 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">a feel for the other person. Sensitivity may be the most accurate idea. If </div><div class="t mb07 x5d h28 y157d ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">you hurt a close friend and no longer speak to that person, it can be said </div><div class="t md25 x5d h28 y56b ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that you no longer really know each other. That is true also of our rela-</div><div class="t m27f x5d h28 yec8 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tionship with God. </div><div class="t mcfc x29 h22 y15a4 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">What is the implication of Jesus&apos; statement found in Matthew 12:30 that </div><div class="t m14eb x5d h22 yd76 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;he that is not with me is against me&quot;? </div><div class="t m35a x29 h28 y56f ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The text indicates that those who do not relate fully to Jesus are not </div><div class="t m1c99 x5d h28 y1c1a ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">with Him. Either we have accepted His offer of forgiveness, or we remain </div><div class="t md04 x5d h28 ye7d ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in our sins. There are no &quot;moderate&quot; or &quot;shallow&quot; relationships with </div><div class="t m313 x5d h28 ye7e ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">God. It is all or nothing. This should not be taken to mean that there are </div><div class="t m74c x5d h28 y864 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">no ups and downs in the Christian experience or that there is no growth, </div><div class="t m6b x5d h28 y1221 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">only that we should know whether or not we have made a full commit-</div><div class="t m403 x5d h28 ybdd ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ment to God through Jesus Christ. In this respect it is similar to our hu-</div><div class="t m394 x5d h28 y14a3 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">man relationships. No one ever should say that a child has only a &quot;shal-</div><div class="t m791 x5d h28 y82c ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">low&quot; relationship to his mother. That relationship may be the most </div><div class="t m1578 x5d h28 yd65 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">meaningful of his life, even if it is a poor one.
