Lynn Martell </div><div class="t m287 x74 h22 y29ed ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Carolyn put the telephone receiver back on the hook. Her </div><div class="t me0a x71 h22 y296c ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">mother&apos;s words still rang in her ear: Her father had been strug-</div><div class="t m7f6 x71 h22 y2876 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">gling with cancer and emphysema, but he was losing the battle. </div><div class="t m40a x71 h22 y2946 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Could she come right away? </div><div class="t m38c x74 h22 y210c ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Although Carolyn had beenreared in a Christian home, both </div><div class="t mab8 x71 h22 y1fec ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">she and her family had strayed from their faith. Now, when death </div><div class="t mb64 x71 h22 y554 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">seemed imminent, she did not know what to say to give her father </div><div class="t m2bb x71 h22 y8cf ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">hope--or to shore up her own faith. Realizing that she did not </div><div class="t m85e x71 h22 y775 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">know God as she should, she spent time fasting and praying, </div><div class="t m5c9 x71 h22 y1644 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">asking God for spiritual restoration to enable her to comfort and </div><div class="t m1737 x71 h22 y1f50 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">help her father. </div><div class="t m191a x61 h22 yab8 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">God came near to her, giving her the assurance of His love and </div><div class="t m454 x71 h22 y12c8 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">acceptance. With new hope she traveled to the island of Hawaii, </div><div class="t mea5 x26 h22 yc01 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">where her parents lived. She spent an entire night reading the </div><div class="t m1ada x26 h22 y144f ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Bible to her father and talking to him about salvation. He renewed </div><div class="t mec7 x71 h22 y170b ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">his faith in Christ and accepted Jesus as his Saviour just before he </div><div class="t m66c x71 h22 y1a10 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">died. </div><div class="t m307 x61 h22 y1234 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">After the funeral Carolyn returned home and continued to </div><div class="t m86c x71 h22 y83e ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">nurture her new relationship with God. She began searching for a </div><div class="t m40a x26 h22 y10dd ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">church that would meet her spiritual needs. She attended several </div><div class="t md7 x26 h22 y17b5 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">churches, but was not satisfied with any of them. </div><div class="t m1476 x61 h22 y59b ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">One day her husband, Taeleipu (Ipu, for short), a post-office </div><div class="t m392 x26 h22 y15a4 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">worker, noticed a brochure for the Discoveries in Prophecy semi-</div><div class="t m63f x26 h22 y932 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">nars as he sorted mail. As a child he had known some Adventists </div><div class="t m2a2 x26 h22 y1afc ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in his homeland of Samoa. Although he also had a Christian </div><div class="t m688 x26 h22 y1923 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">background, he no longer attended church. But he knew his wife </div><div class="t ma20 x26 h22 y9d1 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was searching, and brought one of the brochures home for her. </div><div class="t me71 x26 h22 yd0e ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">When she lost it, he found another one in the trash at work. This </div><div class="t m15b8 x26 h22 y1d2d ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">time he suggested that she attend. He even offered to care for the </div><div class="t m775 x26 h22 y1dac ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">children so she could go. </div><div class="t m5d5 x61 h22 ya3b ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Carolyn began attending the meetings. After each meeting she </div><div class="t m1578 x26 h22 y617 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">shared what she had learned with her husband. He listened and </div><div class="t me4b x26 h22 y72e ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">willingly accepted each truth. </div><div class="t mea4 x64 h22 y1d5e ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">When Ipu needed surgery, members of the Adventist church </div><div class="t m1abf x26 h22 y1a9b ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">visited him in the hospital. Their caring attitude deeply impressed </div><div class="t m76f x26 h22 y1dfa ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">him. Ipu decided that the Adventist faith must be real, and decided </div><div class="t m568 x26 h22 y12e8 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to attend church and be baptized. Today Ipu and Carolyn rejoice </div><div class="t m692 x18 h22 yd67 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in their new walk with God, forged in the face of death. </div><div class="t m1f99 x64 h22 y1950 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">J.
