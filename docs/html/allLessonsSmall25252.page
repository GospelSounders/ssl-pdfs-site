He was scheduled to </div><div class="t m39d x48 h28 y288f ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">begin evangelistic meetings there the next day. Everything was </div><div class="t mf1 x48 h28 y23b5 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ready, but the believers wanted to postpone the meetings. </div><div class="t m69f x4e h28 y18f7 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;It is the time of the annual feast to Olo, a powerful voodoo </div><div class="t mf57 x48 h28 y1f5f ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">god,&quot; one man reported. &quot;Olo requires a human sacrifice, but his </div><div class="t m1499 x48 h28 y1823 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">followers have not yet found a victim to sacrifice. Until the feast is </div><div class="t m55a x48 h28 y1845 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">over, the villagers are afraid to go out after dark. If we start the </div><div class="t m9b3 x48 h28 y11a ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">meetings now, no one will come. It is even unsafe for you, pastor, </div><div class="t m6d7 x48 h28 y1825 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and the church members to be out at night. We think it is best to </div><div class="t m9b9 x48 h28 y1720 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">wait until the feast is over to begin the meetings.&quot; Pastor Charles </div><div class="t m477 x48 h28 y1849 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">agreed to the plan.

Soon the seating area was filled, and many more stood </div><div class="t mec3 x73 h28 y268 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">around the sides.
