When John writes, &quot;We </div><div class="t m5fd x4 h28 y1136 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">accept man&apos;s testimony, but God&apos;s testimony is greater&quot; (1 John 5:9, </div><div class="t m73e x4 h28 y349 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">NIV), he is not saying God has to be believed because of God&apos;s </div><div class="t m32e x4 h28 y857 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">greater power. Rather, &quot;God&apos;s testimony is much stronger&quot; (1 John </div><div class="t m248 x4 h28 y7ed ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">5:9, TEV) because it is given to believers by the indwelling Holy </div><div class="t m110a xe h28 y1ff6 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Spirit.
