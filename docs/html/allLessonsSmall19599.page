His eyes were as a flame of fire, and on his head were many </div><div class="t m25b x6f h6c y2423 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">crowns; and he had a name written, that no man knew, but he himself.

The rider under the first seal of Rev-</div><div class="t mea5 x6f h2d y14ef ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">elation 6 rides on a white horse. Clearly the idea conveyed by this symbol </div><div class="t m1e1 x66 h2d y13d1 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">is that of triumph or accomplishment of purpose. The identity of the rider </div><div class="t m245 x66 h2d y1046 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in Revelation 19 is certain. He is called &quot;Faithful and True.&quot; He is also a </div><div class="t m6f1 x66 h2d y2061 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">righteous judge. Remember Jesus&apos; words: &quot;The Father judgeth no man, </div><div class="t m6e6 x6f h2d y1299 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">but hath committed all judgment unto the Son&quot; (John 5:22). The Son is </div><div class="t m43b x6f h2d y19d0 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">therefore God&apos;s agent or emissary. It is given to Him to wage war against </div><div class="t m15e x6f h2d y12ca ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the forces of evil and to bring the rebellious to judgment—in short, to </div><div class="t m1ce x6f h2d y19d1 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">settle accounts. The fact that He is crowned with many crowns indicates </div><div class="t me8 x6f h2d y18de ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that universal dominion is now His. He is Lord of history (past, present, </div><div class="t m649 x6f h2d y10ce ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and future), of nations and kingdoms; all systems, social and political, </div><div class="t mb52 x6f h2d y113b ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">come under His rule.

The Lamb is </div><div class="t m1184 x6f h2d y1188 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">also the Lion. In fact, the wrath of the Lamb is a terror to the enemies of </div><div class="t m15a x6f h2d yed0 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the Lord. The thought to keep in mind here is that mediation, as far as </div><div class="t m307 x6f h2d y14cc ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">salvation history is concerned, is not complete until the rebellion is effec-</div><div class="t m1315 x6f h2d y11e5 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tively put down. </div><div class="t m300 x53 h2d y1247 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The Mediator accomplishes all of this alone.

He accepted His baptism of blood and trial by fire that countless </div><div class="t m6eb x6f h2d y15d6 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">millions might gain everlasting life. The triumph becomes all the more </div><div class="t m6a0 x6f h2d y124a ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">rewarding for it.
