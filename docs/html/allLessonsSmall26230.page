He </div><div class="t m98d x26 h22 y2b1c ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">grew up in an Adventist home, but during his teens he drifted away </div><div class="t m119e x26 h22 y2992 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">from the church. He dropped out of school and took a job as an auto </div><div class="t m10f7 x26 h22 y28e9 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">mechanic. He was a good one and quickly became the supervisor of </div><div class="t m10ed x26 h22 y2217 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the repair shop. He thought he had everything he wanted from life. </div><div class="t m166 x64 h22 y1eae ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">But a sudden and serious illness shattered his dreams. His doctor </div><div class="t m322 x26 h22 yc74 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">gave him little hope for recovery and suggested that Beven should </div><div class="t m1d6 x26 h22 ybfa ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">prepare to die. </div><div class="t mb4b x64 h22 y15bb ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Beven&apos;s family and friends began praying for him, and God </div><div class="t m133f x26 h22 y1331 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">healed him. Beven returned to God and the church he had left as a </div><div class="t me72 x26 h22 y15cd ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">youth. He began telling others what God had done for him. Soon he </div><div class="t m1139 x26 h22 y144c ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">decided to quit his job as a mechanic and become a lay preacher, </div><div class="t mabe x26 h22 y19d0 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">even though he had no training in preaching or evangelism. </div><div class="t mde1 x64 h22 y1417 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">He wanted to share his faith with people who knew nothing about </div><div class="t m5cb x26 h22 y12cb ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Adventists. He chose Nagusa, a village in the remote mountains of </div><div class="t m1870 x18 h22 y97d ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Guadalcanal. He arrived in Nagusa and began sharing his faith. One </div><div class="t md18 x18 h22 y634 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">local man told Beven to leave the village. When Beven did not leave, </div><div class="t m680 x26 h22 y20a9 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the man beat him.
