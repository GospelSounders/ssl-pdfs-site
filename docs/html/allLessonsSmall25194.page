He had seen some of them working on a road </div><div class="t m856 x14 h28 y237d ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and others helping his neighbor with his crop. He had heard that </div><div class="t mef x14 h28 y209e ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">they were clearing wells—and even washing clothes and cooking </div><div class="t m3f5 x14 h28 y3e8 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">meals for old people. He wondered why these young people were </div><div class="t m1bd x14 h28 y310 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">working so hard for people they did not know. Then he learned </div><div class="t m1717 x14 h28 y61f ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that they were building a mud-and-wattle church in the village. So </div><div class="t mdd0 x14 h28 y14a ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that was it! They were trying to convert people! Well, he thought, </div><div class="t m91b x14 h28 y5df ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">they weren&apos;t going to convert </div><div class="t m883 x79 h2c y5df ff6 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">him! </div><div class="t m398 x28 h28 y1f1 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">One evening Thomas heard singing from the direction of the </div><div class="t m3d2 x14 h28 y361 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">new church. He saw people walking toward the building and </div><div class="t m722 x14 h28 y767 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">wondered if the young people were going to start preaching now. </div><div class="t m37f x14 h28 y243 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">He was not interested in religion; he found comfort in his bottle of </div><div class="t m3d9 x5d h2c y211 ff6 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">waragi, </div><div class="t m87a x3f h28 y211 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Ugandan beer. But by the second week of meetings, Tho-</div><div class="t m809 x5d h28 y262 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">mas decided to go to the church and investigate. And if the preacher </div><div class="t m5c7 x14 h28 y2a0 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">said something about his drinking, he would start an argument. He </div><div class="t m69f x5d h28 yda5 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">fortified his resolve with plenty of </div><div class="t m84b x21 h2c yda5 ff6 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">waragi, </div><div class="t m3be x91 h28 yb4 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and tucked a spare </div><div class="t m391 x5d h28 y154 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">bottle into his old bag. Then he staggered into the meeting. </div><div class="t mf6 x28 h28 ybc7 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">An usher seated Thomas up front, but Thomas was so drunk he </div><div class="t m134e x5d h28 y1d6 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">fell asleep, waking only when the youth sang the closing song. The </div><div class="t m54e x5d h28 ydec ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">next evening he came again, still intending to argue with the </div><div class="t m3c5 x5d h28 y268 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">preacher. He was not so drunk, and did not fall asleep, but the </div><div class="t m146f x5d h28 y4cd ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">meeting ended before he could interject his opinion. He continued </div><div class="t mdd0 x5d h28 y9ad ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">attending the meetings, but each night he was a little more sober. </div><div class="t m68c x28 h28 y180 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">One night the speaker appealed for those who wanted to follow </div><div class="t ma20 x5d h28 y10c ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Jesus to stand. Several people responded, including Thomas. When </div><div class="t m213 x5d h28 y6f2 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the preacher called for believers to keep the Sabbath and be bap-</div><div class="t mce2 x5d h28 y2c3 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tized, Thomas again responded. By now he was sober. He began </div><div class="t mdd0 x5d h28 y2a9 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">studying the Bible and was baptized with 100 others. </div><div class="t m25c x4e h28 y5ba ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Now, instead of arguing with the preacher, Thomas is helping to </div><div class="t m87a x5d h28 y40e ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">build a permanent church. The believers have made burned bricks </div><div class="t mb34 x48 h28 y1e0 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">for the walls, but they have no money for sand or cement for mortar, </div><div class="t m73d x5d h28 yd8a ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">or for timber or iron sheets for the roof. Pray that God will supply </div><div class="t m872 x5d h28 y444 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">their needs as they seek to reach out to others with God&apos;s love. </div><div class="t m522 x4e h1 y3c4 ff1 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Christian Aliddeki is president of the Uganda Union in Eastern Africa </div><div class="t mda9 x48 h1 yc48 ff1 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Division. </div><div class="t mda9 x365 ha0 y34a4 ffa fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0"><span class="fc0 sc0"> </span></div><div class="t m7e0 x29 h34 y459 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">PrOd </div><div class="t m1fb x53 h25 y459 ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">IC</div><div class="t m4d11 x3f h25 y459 ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">1</div><div class="t m4d12 x3f h25 y459 ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">/</div><div class="t m2247 x12 h25 y459 ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">4</div><div class="t m2e0 x12 h34 y459 ff4 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">2(.1 h \ lhC </div><div class="t m7e3 xa4 h25 y459 ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ICIILT;11 </div><div class="t m5 x1d h25 y459 ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0"></div><div class="t m5ce x3a h25 y459 ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">011CCIVI1CC )111CC </div><div class="t m5 xa5 h25 y459 ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0"></div><div class="t m24c7 x95 h25 y459 ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">11</div><div class="t m1b38 xa6 h25 y459 ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">,</div><div class="t mf53 x57 h25 y459 ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">,:•1011 </div><div class="t m5 x7f h25 y459 ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0"></div><div class="t m12dd xc1 h25 y459 ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">\ </div><div class="t m5 x24 h25 y459 ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0"></div><div class="t m113c x25 h25 y459 ff4 fs9 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">CI1C </div><div class="t m113c x365 ha0 y34a5 ffa fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0"><span class="fc0 sc0"> </span></div></div><div class="pi" data-data='{"ctm":[1.000000,0.000000,0.000000,1.000000,0.000000,0.000000]}'></div></div>
