Another is to live peaceably with all men (Rom. 12:18) and to </div><div class="t m1315 x6f h2d yca7 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">work actively toward peace as a sign of the kingdom of God. (See </div><div class="t m9c3 x66 h2d y7c9 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Luke 10:5, 6.) This peace is not just an absence of war, though </div><div class="t m2c9 x6f h2d y139d ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that is part of it. The peace Christians are urged to seek and to </div><div class="t m13d x66 h2d yc77 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">pursue for all men (Ps. 34:14) is the peace given to us by our Lord </div><div class="t m12e5 x66 h2d y837 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Jesus Christ, the Prince of Peace (John 14:27). This peace </div><div class="t m863 x66 h2d y1327 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">should be established within the church itself and also pursued in </div><div class="t ma9e x66 h2d ya89 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the world. </div><div class="t m117f x49 h6c y7d0 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">What attitude should prevail therefore among believers when </div><div class="t m7f8 x66 h6c y127c ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">conflicts do arise? Col. 3:15; 1 Cor. 6:1-8; Phil. 2:1-5. </div><div class="t mb7f x49 h2d ybb4 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Though Christians do have a very positive attitude toward </div><div class="t m170 x66 h2d yd96 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">government, they nevertheless are urged not to seek arbitration </div><div class="t m81d x66 h2d y903 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">outside of their communion of faith. A number of reasons are </div><div class="t ma7b x66 h2d yf05 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">given. First, believers ought to be an example to the world—</div><div class="t m98 x63 h2d yd23 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">examples of peace, fellowship, and love. If society cannot see </div><div class="t m20d x63 h2d yeca ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">these exemplified in the church, then where would they find such </div><div class="t mb1d x63 h2d yecb ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">a model? Second, government agencies are definitely of a lower </div><div class="t m5fc x63 h2d ybd6 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">order than the church. The apostle speaks of the &quot;unrighteous&quot; </div><div class="t mce5 x63 h2d y1236 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">(1 Cor. 6:1, RSV), &quot;unjust&quot; (KJV), and of those who are &quot;least </div><div class="t m54c x63 h2d y987 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">esteemed by the church&quot; (6:4). Third, it puts the whole church </div><div class="t m5f2 x63 h2d yd5f ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to shame if we cannot find persons wise enough in the church to </div><div class="t mbb5 x63 h2d y7dc ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">decide between members who have conflicts with each other (6:5, </div><div class="t m223 x63 h2d y7b9 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">6). It actually is a defeat for the gospel. Finally, Christians have </div><div class="t m20f x63 h2d y12bf ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to learn to have the mind of Christ, in humility counting others </div><div class="t m1d0 x63 h2d ye51 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">better than themselves, having other people&apos;s interest in mind, </div><div class="t m5e8 x63 h2d y103e ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">suffering wrong and being defrauded rather than to be wrong </div><div class="t m221 x63 h2d y90f ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">themselves (6:7-9). The church ought to set an example to the </div><div class="t m9b3 x63 h2d yd45 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">government and to society as a whole, rather than turn to them for </div><div class="t m7d4 x63 h2d ycb4 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">justice. </div><div class="t m73a x50 h6c ye38 ff1 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">In what ways can Christians best promote peace?
