But every man who acknowledges his guilt, </div><div class="t m222 x3 h4 y1cf5 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">thereby declares that God is right. This is what is done in confession </div><div class="t m1b3 x3 h4 y680 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of sin. God says that we are sinners, and He points out to us the par-</div><div class="t mba x3 h4 y1168 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ticular sins. Confession of sin is the simple acknowledgment that </div><div class="t m345 x3 h4 y1bde ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">God is just in declaring us to be sinners, by the standard of His own </div><div class="t m19e x3 h4 y15ce ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">life.

FAULT-FINDING iS a necessary accompaniment of unbelief. It </div><div class="t m709 x3 h4 y682 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">is useless to try to remove objections from the mind of a man in whom </div><div class="t m110b x3 h4 y1ad3 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">is the spirit of unbelief. Though you answer one objection to his sat-</div><div class="t m2d1 x3 h4 y1cfd ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">isfaction, you have accomplished nothing, for the same process must </div><div class="t me7f x3 h4 y1c7a ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">be repeated on every point, and objections will rise faster than they </div><div class="t ma94 x3 h4 y1651 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">can be met. Each individual objection must be met; and though </div><div class="t m907 x3 h4 y1e1a ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ninety-nine out of a hundred were satisfactorily explained, the ob-</div><div class="t m19f x3 h4 y12a ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">jector would be no nearer the truth than at the first. Neither would </div><div class="t ma4c x3 h4 y1e7b ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">he be if the hundredth one were explained. The reason is that those </div><div class="t m110 x3 h4 y1e2e ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">objections have been explained satisfactorily to his reason; he can </div><div class="t m3b3 x3 h4 y11ad ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">plainly see that there was no reason in them. But the spirit of un-</div><div class="t m15d x3 h4 y1ab7 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">belief is still in him, ready to raise a hundred other objections equally </div><div class="t m821 x3 h4 y1870 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">inconsistent with reason. If, however, that spirit of unbelief is once </div><div class="t m3e3 x3 h4 y1053 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">destroyed, those objections will not arise to require explanation. The </div><div class="t m71a xbd h4 y1ff2 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Pharisees and others were full of the spirit of unbelief, and so, although </div><div class="t mbd8 x3 h4 y16e6 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">they refused to receive John&apos;s teaching, on the ground that his ab-</div><div class="t m69b x3 h4 y11e2 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">stemious habits indicated that he possessed a devil, they as promptly </div><div class="t mad9 x3 h4 y1c7c ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">repudiated Jesus just because He did not follow John&apos;s practice but </div><div class="t m23e x3 h4 yb47 ff4 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ate as other people did.
