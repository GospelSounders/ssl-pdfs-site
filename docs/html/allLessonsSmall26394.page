Mali is a large, landlocked </div><div class="t m2436 x4a h27 y21a0 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">country located in the bulge of Africa. Most of the people are Muslim </div><div class="t m1ac2 x4a h27 y28d0 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">or animist, but in spite of this, people are willing to listen to the gospel, </div><div class="t m2e3 x4a h27 y21d9 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and many are accepting Christianity. </div><div class="t med3 x29 h27 y15c8 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">We planned an evangelistic series in one town where the people are </div><div class="t m354 x4a h27 y123d ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">strongly influenced by animism and fetish worship. Through their </div><div class="t m256 x4a h27 y1080 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">traditional chief the people asked us if our God could protect them </div><div class="t m11a0 x14 h27 ybad ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">from sorcerers, evil forces, and the curse of Allah if they decided to </div><div class="t m3142 x14 h27 yd52 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">become Christians. They asked us to show them the power of God. We </div><div class="t m1a0f x4a h27 y1d7a ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">told them to look to the heavens, see the sun and moon and stars that </div><div class="t mb32 x4a h27 y1f12 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">God had hung in the sky. But they wanted tangible evidence. </div><div class="t m172f x29 h27 y1137 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">That night as we presented our discussion, it began to rain hard. </div><div class="t m1bad x4a h27 ye9b ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">This is rare in the desert of Mali, and the people became frightened and </div><div class="t m1816 x14 h27 y10ca ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">fled to their homes. Had God already begun to show His power? </div><div class="t m161a x36 h27 y1cd9 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">That night I woke up feeling something cold on my thigh. I touched it </div><div class="t m2646 x14 h27 y1514 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and immediately realized that it was a snake! If it was poisonous and it bit </div><div class="t m10ed x14 h27 y15c0 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">me, I could die. I cried out to God to deliver me from this snake, then </div><div class="t m279f x14 h27 y1359 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">slowly I began to move, careful to not trap the snake in my trousers. </div><div class="t m2fe6 x36 h27 y1006 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The snake slithered down my trouser leg and onto the floor. I found </div><div class="t m1ddc x14 h27 ya13 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">a flashlight and aimed it at the snake. It lay on the floor unmoving, as if </div><div class="t mcd2 x14 h27 y745 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">it was paralyzed. I recognized it as a </div><div class="t m1d94 x1f h16 y1eda ff6 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">worofi, </div><div class="t m223d x22 h27 y1eda ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">one of the deadliest snakes </div><div class="t m1ada x14 h27 y1f95 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in Africa. One strike would have killed me. I reached for the box in </div><div class="t m1636 x14 h27 y1bcf ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">which I store my picture roll and struck the snake, killing it. </div><div class="t m2318 x36 h27 y13b1 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Word spread through the town that the Adventist pastor had awak-</div><div class="t m236f x14 h27 y1ea1 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ened to fmd a worofi in his trousers and survived. Villagers came to the </div><div class="t mb32 x14 h27 y135d ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">house to see for themselves the snake that could not kill me. &quot;Pastor,&quot; </div><div class="t m1ae0 x14 h27 y1ec4 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">they said, &quot;the worofi did not kill you. What a powerful God you have </div><div class="t m1ff3 x14 h27 y1ce5 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that can protect you from the worofi. Surely He can protect us against </div><div class="t m1be3 x14 h27 y1ddf ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">evil powers if we become Christians.&quot; </div><div class="t m2b x28 h27 ye66 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">By that evening the story had spread to every home in the region. The </div><div class="t m2ec8 x5d h27 y1079 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">meeting place was packed with people. I told them the story of how Paul </div><div class="t m153d x14 h27 y1248 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was saved from the bite of a serpent while on the island of Malta. </div><div class="t mfe x28 h27 y1bd4 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">As a result of my encounter with the deadly worofi, seven people </div><div class="t m266 x14 h27 y1ca0 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">gave their lives to God and were baptized. Many others are preparing </div><div class="t m162e x5d h27 y1546 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">for baptism. Even the traditional chief, a strong Muslim, accepted a </div><div class="t m1f9 x5d h27 y1195 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Bible and is studying the Voice of Hope Bible course. </div><div class="t m129e x28 h27 yeb4 ff4 fs7 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Pray for the people of Mali.
