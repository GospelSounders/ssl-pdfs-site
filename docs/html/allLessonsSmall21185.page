Our Lord promises to give us unlimited power to </div><div class="t m1181 x71 h28 y16cd ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">serve Him and overcome all evil. The pre-advent judgment decides who is </div><div class="t m64f x71 h28 y1af8 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">availing himself of that power, -and who is not. </div><div class="t m384 x73 h28 y1d19 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The pre-advent judgment is intended by God to be a great incentive for </div><div class="t m1a37 x71 h28 y1f95 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">last-day people to turn to Christ and receive His Spirit into their hearts.

(See Ex. </div><div class="t m1494 x71 h28 y1a98 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">25:8.) This sanctuary was not the same as a modern church.
