Sin brought the Flood, and so sin had </div><div class="t m261 x92 he y1a58 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">brought this calamity. God had promised not to send another flood on </div><div class="t m564 x92 he yc14 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the earth, and here He promises not again to be wroth with His people, </div><div class="t m5e1 x92 he y1e99 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">nor rebuke them.
