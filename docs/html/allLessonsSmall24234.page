Even </div><div class="t m6e4 xc h28 y2251 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">some of the man&apos;s cousins were baptized.

Satpal listened </div><div class="t m711 xc h28 yfae ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">carefully, and eventually accepted Jesus as his personal Savior. </div><div class="t mce x49 h28 y16cd ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Satpal&apos;s family members began harassing him; some stopped </div><div class="t m7e4 xc5 h28 y1f25 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">speaking to him.

But Satpal had found a faith stronger than his father&apos;s </div><div class="t mb1d xc5 h28 y302 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">witchcraft; he did not yield to Satan. Satpal married and moved </div><div class="t m23c xc5 h28 y41a ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">into a small one-room home. They were crowded, but he was </div><div class="t m32a xc5 h28 y2041 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">happy in the Lord. </div><div class="t m3c1 x49 h28 y1e7d ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Satpal&apos;s mother and brother continued to worship daily at the </div><div class="t m599 xc5 h28 y21a ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">altar over his father&apos;s tomb.

The </div><div class="t m1cd xc5 h28 y1624 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">altar was a reminder of Satan&apos;s work and power, so Satpal de-</div><div class="t m297 xc5 h28 y120f ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">stroyed it. Many thought that Satpal and his family would be </div><div class="t m5f5 x34 h28 y645 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">harmed or killed, but to everyone&apos;s amazement, the family did not </div><div class="t ma8 xc5 h28 y1a99 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">seek revenge. In fact, Satpal&apos;s mother began to open to the love of </div><div class="t mae4 xc5 h28 yb54 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">God. Although she does not attend church, she sometimes opens </div><div class="t m9e3 x34 h28 y4b7 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">her home to Christian meetings.
