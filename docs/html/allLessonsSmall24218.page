They organized the group and began building a simple </div><div class="t m172 x28 h28 y2d2 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">church. Next the group laid plans for sharing the Adventist mes-</div><div class="t mec2 x28 h28 y974 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sage with the local population. </div><div class="t m5c8 x5b h28 y1951 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">One day Biel and Majiok found a sick man resting outside their </div><div class="t m265 x4e h28 y1a42 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">home.

As their eyes became </div><div class="t m479 x4e h28 yfe1 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">accustomed to the darkness, they noticed five idols placed in a </div><div class="t m59a x4e h28 y116c ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">corner of the room. The idol gods were made from decorated </div><div class="t mce3 x4e h28 y19d1 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">gourds, and each had a name: Kuoth Kier the river god, Koltok the </div><div class="t m9c6 x4e h28 y1072 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">god in the tree, Biel the stone god, Kolang the god in the gourd, </div><div class="t m5d2 x4e h28 y1268 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and Garang, the powerful god of the heavens. These gods had </div><div class="t m2c6 x4e h28 y13f5 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">been in the man&apos;s family for generations; they were venerated </div><div class="t mf3c x4e h28 y1dee ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">with sacrifices and used for fortune telling. The man feared the </div><div class="t m572 x4e h28 y1ad4 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">powerful spirits that inhabited the idols, for he believed they could </div><div class="t m298 x4e h28 y1755 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">bring disaster upon the family if their needs were not satisfied. </div><div class="t mb5 x4e h28 y523 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Garang, the god of heaven, demanded the head of a cow on a stake </div><div class="t m35a x4e h28 y667 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">for his sacrifice. </div><div class="t ma30 x65 h28 ya93 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Biel and Majiok smiled, opened their New Testament, and read </div><div class="t mb90 x4e h28 y20c7 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of another God--the God who knew their names and who wanted </div><div class="t mdc8 x4e h28 y655 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">only their love, not animal sacrifices. The sick man and his family </div><div class="t m3c0 x4e h28 y6aa ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">listened attentively.

Nyatuach, the man&apos;s wife, was especially </div><div class="t meb x60 h28 y6e7 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">interested. Slowly she began to give up her traditional beliefs. But </div><div class="t m3f2 x60 h28 y84c ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">before she had surrendered her life to Jesus, her husband died. Her </div><div class="t m110b x60 h28 yb1d ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">mind was in a turmoil.

Then her husband&apos;s prop-</div><div class="t m112 x60 h28 y10a2 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">erty could be divided, and she would be given to one of her </div><div class="t m140 x60 h28 y1f29 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">husband&apos;s brothers. She hesitated to follow this tradition, but she </div><div class="t m204 x60 h28 y167e ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">knew that she would be accused of wrongdoing if she did not </div><div class="t me47 x60 h28 yb5a ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">follow traditions to honor her late husband.
