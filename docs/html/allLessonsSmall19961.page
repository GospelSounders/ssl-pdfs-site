As was true in the case of Balaam, their greed </div><div class="t m13a x17 h2d y2ce1 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">led them to prefer &quot;the wages of unrighteousness,&quot; &quot;of injustice&quot; or </div><div class="t m5c3 x11 h2d y2b9a ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;wrongdoing,&quot; over the less tangible rewards of rightdoing. </div><div class="t m142 x14 h2d y2b4f ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">We must not infer from that description of the &quot;wages&quot; or &quot;reward&quot; </div><div class="t m2b1 x11 h2d y2458 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that were offered to Balaam (see Num. 22:17, 18; 24:13) that all profit is </div><div class="t m3dd x11 h2d y28f5 ff4 fsa fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">evil.
