The fact that the taxes were imposed by a foreign power was </div><div class="t m711 x27 he ya7 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">a continual irritation to the Jews, being a reminder that their independence </div><div class="t m133e x27 he y1b95 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">had departed. And the taxgatherers were not merely the instruments of Roman </div><div class="t m800 x27 he y39a ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">oppression; they were extortioners on their own account, enriching themselves </div><div class="t m733 x27 he y6cb ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">at the expense of the people. A Jew who accepted this office at the hands of </div><div class="t m6f7 x27 he y4d3 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the Romans was looked upon as betraying the honor of his nation. He was </div><div class="t m59d x27 he y7ec ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">despised as an apostate, and&apos; was classed•with the vilest of society.
