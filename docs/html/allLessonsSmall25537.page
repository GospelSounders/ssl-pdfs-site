Exod. 34:6, 7. </div><div class="t m48b x5f h28 y23fc ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">God&apos;s justice demands that the transgressor pay the penalty of </div><div class="t m318 x73 h28 y21f8 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">transgression. Death is that penalty. So if justice alone were to prevail, </div><div class="t m2ab x73 h28 y20a0 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">all of us would die, for all of us have sinned.

His mercy makes it possible for the condemned sinner to </div><div class="t m404 x73 h28 y1277 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">live. God, in Jesus, paid the penalty for all who repent of their sins and </div><div class="t m9d7 x73 h28 y4d1 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">accept Jesus as their Substitute. God&apos;s mercy is great. But His justice </div><div class="t m628 x73 h28 y100e ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">is real. If we refuse to accept the provisions made for our salvation, </div><div class="t m14db x73 h28 ya0d ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">then we will have to face full justice. </div><div class="t m45f x5f h22 yaa8 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">What truth points out the mercy of God?
