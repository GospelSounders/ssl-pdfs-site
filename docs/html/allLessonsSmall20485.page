God&apos;s righteousness is not </div><div class="t mea2 x74 he y2f87 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">merely an abstract quality of God&apos;s being. It is the way that God makes men and </div><div class="t m67 x74 he y2e83 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">women right with Himselfâ€”His way of righting wrongs. God had brought the </div><div class="t m381 x74 he y2c8a ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">children of Israel out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand (verse 5). This was </div><div class="t m57a x73 he y2bb6 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">a righteous act. Daniel pled that God would again act righteously in restoring </div><div class="t m664 x74 he y2ad4 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">true worship in Jerusalem. </div><div class="t m5c8 x4e h21 y2b93 ff6 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;For the Lord&apos;s sake&quot; </div><div class="t m2bf x87 he y2bdf ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">(verse 17). Daniel asked that the captivity and all that </div><div class="t md5 x74 he y2ba5 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">it entailed be changed so that God&apos;s name would be vindicated. He recognized </div><div class="t m1127 x74 he y23ee ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that the heathen world had a false conception of the power of God. This situation </div><div class="t m7f4 x74 he y2389 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">had to be changed, so that the heathen would not suppose that it was by the might </div><div class="t m5d1 x73 he y1627 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of their own gods that they were victorious and that the children of Judah were in </div><div class="t maa7 x74 he y49 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">captivity. </div><div class="t m6a0 x4e h21 y396 ff6 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;For thy great mercies&quot; </div><div class="t m7d7 x9e he y35e ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">(verse 18). Daniel&apos;s plea was that God be merciful </div><div class="t m12e4 x74 he y88d ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">because it is only through His mercy that favor can be shown. </div><div class="t m6c5 x4e h21 y2af ff6 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;For thine own sake . . . for thy city and thy people are called by thy name&quot; </div><div class="t m55c x74 he y4c8 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">(verse 19). Again Daniel&apos;s plea was based on God doing something to vindicate </div><div class="t m781 x74 he ybf6 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">His name, His character. Our only hope is in God&apos;s righteousness, mercy, for-</div><div class="t m367 x74 he yab ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">giveness, and willingness to save us from sin. </div><div class="t m390 x4e he y4c0 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">In his intercessory prayer Daniel threw himself on the mercy of God. It was </div><div class="t m67 x74 he y25f ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the only thing he could do. Having done this he was confident that God would </div><div class="t m5b0 x74 he yf8 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">not let him or his people down. </div><div class="t mbe7 x4e h1 yd9 ff1 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Why does God sometimes seem to take a long time to effect changes? </div><div class="t m577 x74 h1 y262 ff1 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">2 Peter 3:9. </div><div class="t m2b1 x4e he y6e0 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Many of us always seem to be in a hurry. We can see things only from our </div><div class="t m7e3 x74 he y249 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">limited persepective. But God sees the larger picture. He knows when it is best </div><div class="t m45d x74 he y2bb ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to effect changes. Our concept of time is different from God&apos;s. We may think </div><div class="t mff x74 he y1a1 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that God sometimes is delaying. But actually, God is being merciful, giving </div><div class="t m8a8 x74 he y15 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">everyone ample time to repent and be saved. We should not complain about </div><div class="t m132f x74 he ybb ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">apparent delays, but be thankful that God knows what is best and is in control. </div><div class="t mb5a xe hb y38f ff2 fs8 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">WED </div><div class="t m857 x74 h1 y5ee ff1 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">II. GOD HEARS AND ANSWERS PRAYERS (Dan. 9:20-27). </div><div class="t m403 x4e he ye6 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">One of the blessings of life is that we are not left alone to struggle with diffi-</div><div class="t md15 x74 he y10d ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">cult situations. We have a God who hears and answers prayers. Pause a moment </div><div class="t m582 x74 he y600 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and recall the instances of answered prayer. </div><div class="t mbb5 x60 h1 y3be ff1 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">1. An Immediate Answer to Prayer (Dan. 9:20-23). </div><div class="t m5dd x60 h1 y358 ff1 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">How swiftly did God make provisions for Daniel&apos;s prayer to be ans-</div><div class="t md2e x74 h1 y2ee ff1 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">wered? Daniel 9:20, 21. </div><div class="t m691 x60 he y309 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Daniel was so impressed with the immediacy of the answer to his prayer that </div><div class="t mb98 x74 he y480 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">he repeats the expression, &quot;whiles I was speaking.&quot; He adds the comment that </div><div class="t m78b x74 he y49e ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Gabriel was &quot;caused to fly swiftly.&quot; Gabriel says, &quot;At the beginning of thy </div><div class="t m1f6 x74 he y35a ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">supplications the commandment came forth&quot; (verse 23). God did not wait till </div><div class="t md1a x61 he y345 ff4 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the end of the prayer before He took action. </div><div class="t m381 x74 h1 y6c5 ff1 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">74 </div></div><div class="pi" data-data='{"ctm":[1.000000,0.000000,0.000000,1.000000,0.000000,0.000000]}'></div></div>
