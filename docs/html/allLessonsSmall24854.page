Some moved to villages that still had a </div><div class="t m36d x92 h28 y20e6 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">school, but others simply stopped attending church. Fausto and his </div><div class="t m328 x92 h28 y203e ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">wife tried to keep the church alive. They held regular services, but </div><div class="t m2d2 x92 h28 y1586 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the attendance dwindled until only the two of them came. They </div><div class="t m9f1 x92 h28 y171b ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">prayed earnestly for their village, but the outlook seemed dim. </div><div class="t m227 x18 h28 ye94 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Villagers began tying their goats and sheep in the church to </div><div class="t m12e4 x92 h28 y1ff5 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">keep them out of the rain. Then some villagers began taking boards </div><div class="t m2f1 x92 h28 y18eb ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">from the walls of the church to use for firewood. Fausto tried to </div><div class="t mb91 x92 h28 y1efc ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">stop them, but boards continued to disappear. </div><div class="t m4d2 x18 h28 y1228 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">One day someone noticed that many villagers had large tropical </div><div class="t mcf9 x92 h28 yddc ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ulcers on their legs. It seemed that the ulcers broke out mostly on </div><div class="t m746 x92 h28 y16f9 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">people who had desecrated the church. The superstitious people </div><div class="t mec3 x92 h28 y1f4 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">decided that they were being punished for damaging God&apos;s church, </div><div class="t mf4d x92 h28 y34a ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and they stopped taking the wood. </div><div class="t m1f5 x18 h28 y286 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Fausto was invited to move to another village and minister to an </div><div class="t mf0 x92 h28 y1d72 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">active Adventist church. He decided that if the church did not </div><div class="t m9f6 x92 h28 y1d16 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">show growth within three months, he would accept the call. Soon </div><div class="t mcf9 x15 h28 y9e4 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">after this Fausto learned that student missionaries from Mountain </div><div class="t m69f x15 h28 y19c9 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">View College were coming to reopen the school. The villagers </div><div class="t m426 x15 h28 yd5b ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">welcomed the missionaries, and some began taking Bible studies </div><div class="t mad2 x15 h28 y1afa ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">from Fausto and the students. Many who had slipped away began </div><div class="t m6c2 x15 h28 y20df ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">attending church again. Within four months 147 precious souls </div><div class="t m6b x15 h28 y1770 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">were baptized. Fausto and his wife did not leave their village.
