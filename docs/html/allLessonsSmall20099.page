At the very moment Paul was writing this letter a Roman centurion </div><div class="t m639 x48 h28 y2e84 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">stood guard over him, reminding him that life indeed is a battle. (See Acts </div><div class="t mce1 x48 h28 y2c09 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">28:16.) He could still vividly recall Julius, the Roman soldier who had </div><div class="t ma5e x48 h28 y2a6c ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">charge of him on the voyage to Rome. This made him aware of the garb </div><div class="t mae x48 h28 y2a7f ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and the life of a soldier. He could sense the unswerving loyalty of a sol-</div><div class="t m373 x48 h28 y29d5 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">dier for his commander.

Death was not too high a price to pay for victory.
