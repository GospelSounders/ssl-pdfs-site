Following the baptism, Ali, a church mem-</div><div class="t m305 x11 h28 y2beb ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ber, shared this story: </div><div class="t m469 x5d h28 y2881 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">He and his family had fled the country of Mali as refugees. They </div><div class="t m1312 x11 h28 y2090 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">had traveled to several countries looking for work and a safe place to </div><div class="t m135e x11 h28 y1613 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">live. Then Ali heard of an organization called ADRA, in Niger. He </div><div class="t m1df x11 h28 yed5 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">contacted ADRA, hoping that someone could help him. He met the </div><div class="t m5bd x11 h28 y1b25 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">local pastor, who listened to Ali&apos;s story and offered him hope. When </div><div class="t m7e8 x11 h28 ya81 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Ali revealed that he was searching for answers to spiritual questions, </div><div class="t m5d1 x11 h28 y8d0 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the pastor gave him some material to read. Ali accepted the material </div><div class="t m4f x11 h28 y137a ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and later began studying a Bible correspondence course. As he stud-</div><div class="t m116a x11 h28 yf21 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ied, he found answers to many of his questions. </div><div class="t m460 x5d h28 y1bac ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Ali wanted to tell his wife, Adama, about his new discoveries, but </div><div class="t m1e7 x11 h28 y1e68 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was not sure how. She was a faithful Muslim. Finally he decided to </div><div class="t m147a x17 h28 y18fa ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">invite her to church on Sabbath morning. When they arrived at church, </div><div class="t m7d5 x17 h28 yc54 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Adama was shocked. &quot;How could you do this?&quot; she demanded. &quot;This </div><div class="t m14b6 x17 h28 y901 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">is terrible! You have brought me to a Christian church!&quot; Adama went </div><div class="t m1ba0 x17 h28 yf29 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">home, packed her belongings, and returned to her village. </div><div class="t m1f5 x48 h28 y1f86 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Ali was confused. What had he done? A few days later Ali was </div><div class="t m18e1 x17 h28 y247 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">summoned to appear before the marabous (Koran teachers) to answer </div><div class="t m68d x17 h28 ycf6 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">his wife&apos;s charges. They tried to convince him to give up his interest in </div><div class="t m19f7 x17 h28 yf6d ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Christianity. &quot;What you did was very serious,&quot; they told him. &quot;With </div><div class="t m4f x17 h28 y3d5 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Christians we do not even eat!&quot; </div><div class="t m68f x48 h28 y1457 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Ali told them simply, &quot;One day the Lord will judge me and my </div><div class="t m629 x17 h28 y1e73 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">choices. And my wife alone must decide whether to return to me and </div><div class="t mb55 x17 h28 y1d1b ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">our children or to give up the family forever.&quot; </div><div class="t m4c8 x48 h28 yc9a ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Adama returned home to her family, but was not interested in </div><div class="t mb64 x17 h28 ya4e ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Christianity. Ali was becoming discouraged. His problem seemed too </div><div class="t mac0 x17 h28 y704 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">big to handle; he was ready to give up Christianity. </div><div class="t m57d x48 h28 yd10 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">On Christmas morning Adama asked her husband, &quot;What gift do </div><div class="t m84d x3e h28 y198a ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">you have for me?&quot; Noting the look of surprise on his face, she </div><div class="t mf9 x3e h28 y3f5 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">continued, &quot;I know that Christians give gifts on Christmas.&quot; But Ali </div><div class="t m7ec x3e h28 y96f ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">had no gifts to give that day. &quot;Never mind,&quot; Adama answered. </div><div class="t m26bc xba h22 y96f ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">&quot;I </div><div class="t m1656 xc8 h28 y96f ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">have </div><div class="t m1105 x3e h28 y184 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">a gift for you. I will come to church with you.&quot; </div><div class="t m367 x73 h28 y1dc6 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Ali was thrilled when his wife joined him for church. Later she </div><div class="t m1755 x3e h28 y1c01 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">began Bible studies. And on that Sabbath day Adama was baptized. </div><div class="t m256 x3e h28 y21d6 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">For Ali it was the best gift! </div><div class="t m654 x73 h22 y1323 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">David Ferraro is president of the Niger Mission in the Sahel </div><div class="t mdc x16 h22 ybf3 ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Union of West Africa. </div><div class="t mb64 x61 h28 yd87 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">For Current Newsbreak, Call I -800-648-5824. </div></div><div class="pi" data-data='{"ctm":[1.000000,0.000000,0.000000,1.000000,0.000000,0.000000]}'></div></div>
