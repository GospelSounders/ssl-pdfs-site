Do they praise God? </div><div class="t m9de x14 h22 y2c5e ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Psalms 6:5; 115:17. </div><div class="t m775 x29 h28 y2b5e ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The Bible teaches that the dead are sleeping, without any awareness of </div><div class="t m1ea x14 h28 y2baf ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">what is happening on earth or in heaven. They do not praise God because </div><div class="t m281 x14 h28 y2368 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">they cannot. If the good were in heaven immediately after death, wouldn&apos;t </div><div class="t md32 x14 h28 y23bf ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">they praise the Lord? </div><div class="t m7f8 x29 h28 y2190 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The parable of the rich man and </div><div class="t m763 x52 h22 y237e ff1 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I </div><div class="t m5d3 x2b h28 y237e ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0"> .a7arus (Luke 16:19-31) is often used as </div><div class="t me49 x14 h28 y1617 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">evidence of life in either heaven or hell immediately after death. The parable </div><div class="t mafc x14 h28 y1b1f ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">is simply designed to teach the danger of covetousness. It offers no support </div><div class="t mb55 x14 h28 yc12 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">for the doctrine of the immortality of the soul. If the parable is interpreted </div><div class="t m329 x14 h28 y18b1 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">literally it becomes an absurdity. </div><div class="t m1348 x29 h28 y1645 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">For example, the beggar went to &quot;Abraham&apos;s bosom.&quot; Obviously that is a </div><div class="t m1362 x14 h28 yaa ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">symbol. Abraham would have needed a very large chest to literally accom-</div><div class="t m77f x14 h28 y1a65 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">modate all the righteous dead. The rich man in hell spoke of Lazarus&apos; finger, </div><div class="t m10f7 x14 h28 y1706 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and his own tongue. In this parable the dead have bodies. But immortal soul </div><div class="t m175a x14 h28 y1885 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">advocates believe that the souls of the dead are disembodied. Who imagines </div><div class="t m76d x14 h28 y1d8d ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that it is possible for the good in heaven to converse with the wicked in hell, </div><div class="t m66c x14 h28 y244 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">as they do in this parable? The rich man wanted Lazarus to go to his living </div><div class="t m311 x14 h28 y18ed ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">brothers and warn them. The only way that could happen, accordingto this </div><div class="t m7fe x14 h28 y199d ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">story, would be if &quot;one rose from the dead&quot; (Luke 16:31). That is quite </div><div class="t mcc x14 h28 y1a66 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">different from the popular idea that dead souls can communicate with the </div><div class="t m1180 x14 h28 y194a ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">living without a resurrection being necessary. </div><div class="t m547 x29 h28 yaa5 ff4 fs14 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Jesus was using a popular fable as a sermon illustration.
